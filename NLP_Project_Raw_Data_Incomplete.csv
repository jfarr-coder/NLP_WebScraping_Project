0,Yahoo,Putin's war in Ukraine 'should concern every person on Earth': Why political observers say the Russian observers say teh Russian invasion may foretell an era of...,I,"Could the war in Ukraine mark the beginning of a new era defined by global unrest and power grabs?

That’s what some political observers are suggesting. In the days leading up to Russia’s invasion of its neighboring country, commentators and officials were framing a potential war as one with much larger implications — not just for Eastern Europe or all of Europe, but for all the world.

At heart is the concern that following a post-World War II period in which countries, especially superpowers, rarely imposed their will on others through military means, the Ukrainian war could signal a different — and decidedly more dangerous — approach.

“The Russian threat to invade Ukraine should concern every person on Earth,” wrote historian and philosopher Yuval Noah Harari in The Economist. “If it again becomes normative for powerful countries to wolf down their weaker neighbors, it would affect the way people all over the world feel and behave.”

Ulrich Speck, an expert on global order, expressed a similar sentiment to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, though he focused mainly on the Ukrainian situation’s implications for Europe. He noted that citizens of the continent had become accustomed to the idea of living in an era “where soft power replaced hard power and international law created the foundation of a mutually beneficial order.”

And now? “All these assumptions are being questioned,” Speck said. “Old-style power politics are back.”
David E. Sanger, White House and national security correspondent for the New York Times, said the stakes are “very real” in terms of the Ukrainian situation’s broader implications. He pointed to how international agreements, such as those via NATO, created since the fall of the Soviet Union, “have kept Europe secure.” In turn, “most Europeans, and frankly most Americans, have come to just assume (that’s) the way the world is organized.”

But Russian president Vladimir Putin is upending that assumption, Sanger said: “Putin is using this moment and holding Ukraine hostage to say, ‘No, no, no … It may be the way the world was organized for the past 25 years, but it’s not the way we’re willing to have the world organized for the next 25.’”

Frank Bruni, a contributing opinion writer to the Times, put it more bluntly, saying many of us had falsely come to believe that we had entered an “enlightened” — and essentially, war-free — era.

“I don’t know if it’s a boomer thing, a modern thing, an elite thing or some other thing, but in my lifetime, in this country, among many of my generational peers, there has been a sense that people had learned particular lessons and were evolving past extremes of pettiness and barbarism, certainly in the corners of the globe deemed more enlightened,” Bruni wrote.
Clearly, that’s not the case, Bruni added: “Embarrassment, vanity, viciousness: History never moves on or gets past these forces, which drove invasions and conquests in centuries past and will drive invasions and conquests in years to come.”

It isn’t just political observers who are sounding such warning calls. So, too, are political officials. In a January speech in Berlin, U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said that allowing Russia to “violate those principles” of not using force to reshape political borders “would drag us all back to a much more dangerous and unstable time.”

Blinken added that the Russian-Ukranian situation is “bigger than a conflict between two countries…. It’s a crisis with global consequences, and it requires global attention and action.”",https://www.marketwatch.com/story/putins-war-in-ukraine-should-concern-every-person-on-earth-why-political-observers-say-the-russian-invasion-may-foretell-an-era-of-global-disorder-11645731455?siteid=yhoof2,Could the war in Ukraine mark the beginning of a new era defined by global unrest and power grabs?,2/24/2022
1,The Daily Wire,Colin Kaepernick Offering Free Autopsies For Families Of Those Killed In ‘Police-Related’…,I,"Former NFL quarterback-turned-activist Colin Kaepernick is offering free secondary autopsies through his nonprofit for the family members of anyone killed in a “police-related” incident.

Kaepernick is launching the initiative through his Know Your Rights Camp, which hosts a series of conferences aimed at younger people “to advance the liberation and well-being of Black and Brown communities through education, self-empowerment, mass-mobilization and the creation of new systems.” The activist said that offering free autopsies is a way to protect potential victims against the “prison industrial complex.”


“We know that the prison industrial complex, which includes police and policing, strives to protect and serve its interests at all costs,” Kaepernick said, according to ESPN. “The Autopsy Initiative is one important step toward ensuring that family members have access to accurate and forensically verifiable information about the cause of death of their loved one in their time of need.”

According to the Know Your Rights Camp website, the Autopsy Initiative’s goal is to “provide a second autopsy free-of-charge for victims’ families who have lost their loved ones due to a police-related death. The services offered through the Initiative include the completion of a second autopsy, disclosure of preliminary findings, and issuance of the final autopsy report.”

The website continued:


A police-related death occurs when an individual is harmed by police officers while using deadly force which results in the individual’s death. A police-related death includes in-custody deaths. In-custody deaths include deaths that arise during contact with law enforcement officers during arrest, pursuit, booking, transport, or incarceration. Therefore, pre-custody deaths are included within in-custody deaths. 

Our Initiative includes a team of board-certified pathologists. Our board-certified pathologists will work objectively, efficiently and, diligently while relying on established forensic principles when conducting the second autopsy. Our pathologists will actively seek the truth to provide the victims’ families with the most medically sound cause of death. 

The Autopsy Request may be completed by anyone with a close relationship with the victim, which may include the victim’s spouse, partner, relative, close friend, or lawyer. However, only the victim’s legal representative and/or other authorized individuals can legally authorize the autopsy. 

Kaepernick’s racial-justice activism took off after he kneeled for the national anthem before a game in 2016. He escalated his efforts in 2020 after the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in May 2020. In an essay several months later in October, Kaepernick called for the abolition of police and prisons.

“The central intent of policing is to surveil, terrorize, capture, and kill marginalized populations, specifically Black folks,” Kaepernick wrote. “In order to eradicate anti-Blackness, we must also abolish the police. The abolition of one without the other is impossible.”",https://www.dailywire.com/news/colin-kaepernick-offering-free-autopsies-for-families-of-those-killed-in-police-related-incidents,Former NFL quarterback-turned-activist Colin Kaepernick is offering free secondary autopsies through his nonprofit for the family members of anyone killed in a “police-related” incident.,2/25/2022
2,The Daily Wire,Amanda Seyfried Reveals Why She Originally Said No To Playing Elizabeth Holmes In New Hulu…,I,"TV viewers are obsessed with the idea of a con gone wrong, and one of the biggest is the story of Elizabeth Holmes. The disgraced Theranos founder was once heralded as the fastest rising star in the healthcare industry, earning billions from venture capitalists to grow her company. Now, she’s facing up to 20 years in federal prison for multiple convictions of fraud. Holmes’s story is coming to Hulu soon as part of a miniseries called “The Dropout.”

“Mean Girls” alum Amanda Seyfried is taking on the lead role despite turning down the opportunity at first. The actress spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about why she wasn’t hung up on recreating Holmes’s signature deep voice plus the reason she initially didn’t want to sign up for the project. 


Originally, “SNL” actress Kate McKinnon was slated to play Holmes, but she dropped out to join the miniseries “Joe vs Carole.” Seyfried got the offer to replace McKinnon and quickly turned it down.

“Listen, I was having a f***ing moment, OK?” she told THR. “I had COVID. I was isolating in the basement of a gross townhouse in Savannah, Georgia, because my husband was working on a movie there. And now an L.A. shoot? Pass!”

After giving the role some thought and consideration, Seyfried changed her mind and decided to give it a try. However, the actress swears she never tried to completely copy Holmes’s very deep voice. 


“I knew my voice was never going to be as deep as hers because I’m physically not capable of it,” Seyfried told the publication. “Besides, I promised I wasn’t going to give myself a hard time and try to completely mimic this other human being. It’d be impossible. And just not fun.”

The subject of Holmes tricking some of the savviest people in business into believing she had a viable product has been explored before. There’s the best-seller “Bad Blood,” the documentary  “The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley,” and a popular podcast called “The Dropout,” which serves as a major contributor to the new Hulu miniseries.




Despite learning everything there was to know about Holmes, Seyfried insists that the real person behind the con remains a mystery. “I watched and listened to all of it, but I learned nothing about her,” the actress said. “It’s crazy that she can still be such an enigma with all the information surrounding her.”

Elsewhere in the article, screenwriter Elizabeth Meriwether discussed her hypothesis on how Holmes was able to trick so many people. “You hear a lot of, ‘How did she get all these men on board with the company? They must have been in love with her,’ ” Meriwether said. “That’s too simplistic an answer for why everything happened.”

The miniseries seeks to delve deeper into Holmes’s motivations, not just what she did. “This is not just about showing all the points where this woman made bad choices,” Seyfried explained. “We’re investigating why we love a fall from grace, why we want to watch train wrecks.”


“The Dropout” is just one in a long line of documentaries about Silicon Valley hotshots who ended up being not so hot after all. According to THR, other “upcoming Silicon Valley downfall dramas” include Showtime’s “Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber,” Apple TV+’s WeWork expose “WeCrashed” and HBO’s exploration into the Facebook indictment, “Doomsday Machine.” 

“The Dropout” premieres March 3 on Hulu.",https://www.dailywire.com/news/amanda-seyfried-reveals-why-she-originally-said-no-to-playing-elizabeth-holmes-in-new-hulu-series-the-dropout,"TV viewers are obsessed with the idea of a con gone wrong, and one of the biggest is the story of Elizabeth Holmes.

3,The Daily Wire,Federal Judge Compares January 6 Riot To War In Ukraine During Sentencing Of Man Who Stole…,I,"On Friday, United States District Judge for the District of Columbia, Reggie Walton, reportedly compared the actions of January 6 rioters at the U.S. Capitol to Russian forces invading Ukraine while sentencing the man who stole Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s lectern during the breach.

Walton claimed the U.S. was on a “dangerous slide” and that the riot was what you would see in “banana republics” or “what we’re experiencing now in Ukraine.” The accused man, Adam Johnson from Florida, said he would not have tried to harm Pelosi, but rather he would have asked “for a selfie with her, if anything” had he ran into her that day.


Johnson, the man who posed for a photograph that went viral as he waltzed through the U.S. Capitol building carrying Pelosi’s stolen lectern, was sentenced to 75 days in jail for his misdemeanor, ABC News’ Tampa Bay affiliate reported:

Johnson pleaded guilty to one count of entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds and was sentenced by a federal judge in Washington, D.C. Friday. In addition to the jail sentence, Johnson was fined $5,000 and sentenced to 200 hours of community service. 

Because of time already served, Johnson only has to spend 60 more days in jail.


According to Politico, Walton opined that the U.S. could end up in a war-torn future if the government doesn’t “do anything” to stop future events like January 6:

In handing down the sentence, Judge Reggie Walton said the U.S. was headed in a dangerous direction if activities like the insurrection continue.

“That’s what we see in countries, like what we’re experiencing now in Ukraine,” Judge Walton said, according to Politico. “That’s where we’re headed if we don’t do anything to stop it.”

For his part, Johnson was apologetic and expressed his understanding that things would be very different for him had he pulled this sort of stunt in a foreign nation, NBC News reported:


Johnson, speaking to the court on Friday, said he’d been “nothing but cooperative” with the government since his arrest, and said his actions demonstrated that he was apologetic and was “ashamed” to have been a part of the Capitol riot.

Johnson said he recognized that if he did what he did in another country, he’d be “on a firing wall instead of a courtroom.” He claimed he had no intent to harm Pelosi.

Johnson is a stay-at-home father of five, and admitted in court that he stole the lectern “because he believed it would make a good prop for a picture.”

According to NBC News, “Johnson also admitted that he shouted that a bust of George Washington would be ‘a great battering ram’ as rioters attempted to break into the floor of the U.S. House, where members of Congress were still present.”


As for what the world is “experiencing now in Ukraine,” as Walton referenced, there are currently thousands of Ukrainians are fleeing the country with dozens — potentially hundreds — of Russians and Ukrainians killed so far as Russia continues its full-scale attack on the Eastern European nation.",https://www.dailywire.com/news/federal-judge-compares-january-6-riot-to-war-in-ukraine-during-sentencing-of-man-who-stole-pelosis-lectern,"On Friday, United States District Judge for the District of Columbia, Reggie Walton, reportedly compared the actions of January 6 rioters at the U.S. Capitol to Russian forces invading Ukraine while sentencing the man who stole Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s lectern during the breach.",2/25/2022
4,The Daily Wire,"Biden Turned Over Intelligence To China On Russia’s Plans To Invade Ukraine, China Gave It To…",I,"Democrat President Joe Biden’s administration turned over intelligence to communist China for months about Russia’s plans to invade Ukraine in an attempt to get China to convince Russia to not invade, according to a report.

“Over three months, senior Biden administration officials held half a dozen urgent meetings with top Chinese officials in which the Americans presented intelligence showing Russia’s troop buildup around Ukraine and beseeched the Chinese to tell Russia not to invade,” The New York Times reported. “Each time, the Chinese officials, including the foreign minister and the ambassador to the United States, rebuffed the Americans, saying they did not think an invasion was in the works. After one diplomatic exchange in December, U.S. officials got intelligence showing Beijing had shared the information with Moscow, telling the Russians that the United States was trying to sow discord — and that China would not try to impede Russian plans and actions.”


The report comes after Russia launched a full-scale invasion into Ukraine late this week and fighting has already reached the country’s capital city of Kyiv, although U.S. officials claim that Russia’s advance has been slowed down some by Ukrainian resistance.

The meetings in which the Biden administration turned over intelligence to Beijing started after Biden held a video summit with Chinese dictator Xi Jinping in mid-November.

The New York Times added:


After the meeting, American officials decided that the Russian troop buildup around Ukraine presented the most immediate problem that China and the United States could try to defuse together. Some officials thought the outcome of the video summit indicated there was potential for an improvement in U.S.-China relations. Others were more skeptical, but thought it was important to leave no stone unturned in efforts to prevent Russia from attacking, one official said.

Days later, White House officials met with the ambassador, Qin Gang, at the Chinese Embassy. They told the ambassador what U.S. intelligence agencies had detected: a gradual encirclement of Ukraine by Russian forces, including armored units. William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director, had flown to Moscow on Nov. 2 to confront the Russians with the same information, and on Nov. 17, American intelligence officials shared their findings with NATO.

White House officials told China about the allegedly tough sanctions that they would impose on Russia and how those sanctions could negatively impact China because of China’s close ties with Russia. They also tried to persuade China that its global image could suffer.

Their desperate attempts “went nowhere” and China’s Qin was reportedly acted “skeptical and suspicious,” according to The New York Times report.",https://www.dailywire.com/news/biden-turned-over-intelligence-to-china-on-russias-plans-to-invade-ukraine-china-gave-it-to-russia-report-says,"“Over three months, senior Biden administration officials held half a dozen urgent meetings with top Chinese officials in which the Americans presented intelligence showing Russia’s troop buildup around Ukraine and beseeched the Chinese to tell Russia not to invade,” The New York Times reported. “Each time, the Chinese officials, including the foreign minister and the ambassador to the United States, rebuffed the Americans, saying they did not think an invasion was in the works.

5,The Daily Wire,NATO Takes Unprecedented Action To Respond To Russia: Putin’s ‘Objectives Not Limited To…,I,"NATO activated the NATO Response Force for the first time ever on Friday in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion into Ukraine, which many critics have said is a result of weakness from Democrat President Joe Biden.

“NATO Supreme Allied Commander Gen. Tod Wolters activated the multinational force consisting of land, air, sea and special operations forces from the allies that can deploy quickly in support of the NATO alliance,” CNN reported. “The entire NATO Response Force is 40,000 troops but [NATO Secretary General Jens] Stoltenberg did not say how many would be activated.”


Stoltenberg warned during a press conference on Friday that Putin’s “objectives are not limited to Ukraine.”

German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht described Putin as acting “highly unpredictable,” worrying that he may attack NATO countries.

“We have a residual hope that he will not cross further borders,” she said. “But I have to say, honestly: that is no certainty.”



Wolters said that NATO has forces operating in the maritime, land, air, space, and cyber domains that are actively working to defend NATO’s sovereignty.


“This is an historic moment and the very first time the Alliance has employed these high readiness forces in a deterrence and defense role. They represent a flexible, combat credible force that can be employed in multiple ways and we are utilizing fully their inherent agility,” he said. “These deterrence measures are prudent and enhance our speed, responsiveness and capability to shield and protect the one billion citizens we swore to protect. We are grateful to our allies Canada and the United States for their recent commitments to deploy an additional 7,460 troops, including an armored brigade combat team, artillery units, a naval frigate, and surveillance aircraft, to support this Alliance-wide effort.”

“As NATO establishes this enhanced vigilance on the Alliance’s eastern flank, Allied military forces will posture and exercise to increase our readiness and interoperability. Your soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines stand ready to protect every meter of Allied territory,” he continued. “We admire the courage and tenacity of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and citizens in defending their country. The Alliance remains steadfast in our collective commitment to shield and protect each other. Moving forward, we are prepared to leverage the strength of all our forces to defend the Alliance.”",https://www.dailywire.com/news/nato-takes-unprecedented-action-to-respond-to-russia-putins-objectives-not-limited-to-ukraine,Stoltenberg warned during a press conference on Friday that Putin’s “objectives are not limited to Ukraine.”,2/25/2022
6,The Daily Wire,Heartbreaking Footage Shows Ukrainian Nurses Comforting Newborns In Makeshift Bomb Shelter Amid…,I,"Videos of injured citizens and tanks rolling into Ukraine are making the horror of Russia’s invasion palpable even for people living thousands of miles away. But a video featuring some of the most defenseless Ukrainian citizens is among the most heartbreaking footage to come out of conflict so far. The clip highlights the depth of fear and helplessness among the population.

According to The Daily Mail, the video was captured by medical staff as they helped around one dozen newborn babies settle into what appears to be a storage closet inside a makeshift bomb shelter. Prior to being relocated, the newborns were patients at Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Children’s Clinical Hospital in Dnipro, which is located in Eastern Ukraine. 


The city became a target of missile strikes shortly after Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of the neighboring country began. Premature and other vulnerable babies were among those evacuated to the basement for safety during the bombing. The NICU, which stands for Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, is where premature or ill newborn babies go for extra care ranging from feeding tubes to ventilators, which help the babies stay alive.



Footage shows NICU nurses tending to the babies with several of them rocking and comforting the newborns, who are wrapped in colorful blankets and sleeping quietly. Medical staff members are seen on video helping use inflatable bags to deliver air, with some nurses even smiling amid the danger.

“This is the NICU. In a bomb shelter. Can you imagine?” Dr. Denis Surkov, chief of the neonatal unit wrote to the New York Times in a text message. “This is our reality.” 

The babies were moved to the makeshift bomb shelter after bombing began Thursday morning as a necessary precaution.   


“We were nervous, very confused,” Dr. Surkov continued. 

Ukraine’s foreign minister criticized Russia’s aggressive invasion of Ukraine on Thursday, calling it “beyond evil” that hospitals were among the targets of the strikes.

Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter, “Consider this: Putin has launched a massive war of aggression in Europe during a still raging pandemic. On top of that, Russians bomb Ukrainian hospitals now. This is beyond evil. The only moral choice any government can make now is to support Ukraine by all means.”


The video of fragile newborns is only one of many tragic images to come out of the early days of the Russian invasion. Footage of a man saying goodbye to his daughter as she evacuated to safety moved many people to tears. 

The video shows the father bending down to hug the little girl goodbye and straighten her winter hat before breaking down into sobs. The child also cries as the two embrace one last time before she boards a bus, which is likely headed to a safer location.

There’s also a shocking video that reportedly shows a military tank running over an occupied car in Kyiv as horrified citizens look on. The driver of the car miraculously survived the incident. Unfortunately, these video clips are unlikely to be the last harrowing footage that comes out of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.",https://www.dailywire.com/news/heartbreaking-footage-shows-ukrainian-nurses-comforting-newborns-in-makeshift-bomb-shelter-amid-russian-invasion,"According to The Daily Mail, the video was captured by medical staff as they helped around one dozen newborn babies settle into what appears to be a storage closet inside a makeshift bomb shelter.

7,The Daily Wire,‘We’re Closer To A Really Big War Than Most Civilians Want To Face’: Historian Niall Ferguson…,I,"When they sat down over coffee for the new Daily Wire series, “The Search,” podcaster Ben Shapiro and renowned historian Niall Ferguson couldn’t have known just how timely their interview would prove to be. During a roving discussion taped in late January in Palm Beach, the pair dissected the United States’ inability to properly weigh risk when it comes to foreign policy and what that fecklessness might mean to China and Russia. 

With a now-eerie prescience, the Hoover Institute fellow tells Shapiro that, based on his knowledge of world skirmishes over the last 100 years, the Biden administration’s weakness on the international stage will undoubtedly lead Russia to launch an attack on Ukraine. “The threat of sanctions is not going to stop Putin invading Ukraine,” he says with surety. “I still think it’s quite likely that he will increase his military aggression towards Ukraine because financial sanctions are not an effective deterrent, and I don’t think they’re an effective deterrent against the Chinese, either.”



Weeks later, bombs began to fall in Kyiv. 

The West’s bizarre overreaction to the marginal danger posed by COVID-19 compared to its apathy toward the serious threats China and Russia present dominates much of the 90-minute dialogue, available to Daily Wire subscribers. “This is one of the odd things about safetyism — the cult of treating all risks as incredibly high,” Ferguson points out. “Oddly enough, it desensitizes you to the real risks. And I think the U.S. has become pathologically incapable of thinking realistically about risk.”

How this has manifested, he explains, is with federal authorities pushing to mask children and force vaccines on young people who face almost no danger from the coronavirus while blithely ignoring the fact that the world’s most powerful authoritarian regimes have suddenly begun behaving as allies. 


“We’re closer to a really big war than most civilians want to face,” he concludes.

Legacies Over Risk

The looming reality of seismic geopolitical events leads the friends to reflect on just how endemic distorted perspectives have become in America. 


Ferguson says working on his last book, “Doom: The Politics of Catastrophe,” made him realize that, while fear of a virus might have highlighted the problem, defective public choice has been around for at least 20 years. Generations ago, he explains, both the public and the federal government were better at assessing risk because they had no choice. 

“I mean, coming out of the 1930s and 40s, you confronted some very profound risks, nuclear war being the biggest,” he says. “But my sense is that the further away we got from World War II, the less good our elites have been at assessing risk and the more inclined they have been to say, ‘Why worry about probabilities? Let’s assume that everything is a huge risk. And then let’s design extraordinarily complex regulations to prevent risk.’” The unrealistic goal, he argues, appears to be to prevent death.

For Shapiro, this shallowness that views the mere preservation of life as the greatest objective also explains our current national obsession with identity, as well as the epidemic of mental health issues plaguing younger generations. He points out with a bit of gallows humor that such a value structure can’t help but breed a culture-wide sense of meaninglessness and unfulfillment. 


“Like if [assassins] get me in the Everglades, honestly, they deserve it,” he jokes about a recent vacation with his family, where it dawned on him that if his haters were to successfully gun him down (as online trolls have threatened to do over the years), he’d have to give them credit for their marksmanship. “Like if they get that shot and they nail me and I’m floating among the mangroves and alligators,” he laughs, “I’ll just have to give them credit. Like, really, that’s an excellent hit.” 

What’s clear a moment later is Shapiro’s dark amusement comes from his deep sense of mission, his conviction that his life has a greater purpose than merely preserving his heart-beat. Like the men who founded the nation, he says he cares more about building something of lasting value than in being physically safe.

“My dad used to be kind of paranoid about [me voicing my political opinions],” Shapiro reveals, “and he used to say, ‘Are you sure you want to say this about Islamists or are you sure you want to say this about the Chinese?’ Shapiro’s answer: “Yeah, I am. I mean, at a certain point, you’ve got to say what you’re going to say.” Because that’s what it takes, he argues, to build institutions that have the potential to transform a society from one in which happiness is found in the arbitrary notion of feeling personally “affirmed” to one in which meaning is derived from accomplishment.

“If the ages have taught us anything,” Shapiro says, “it’s that your happiness has very little to do with how you sit on a given day and has a lot more to do with whether you’re building things of consequence.”

Building Institutions

Though their critics often like to pretend otherwise, over the course of the discussion both Ferguson and Shapiro are clear that their hope for the future doesn’t lie solely in winning elections or “owning” libs, but in creating organizations that leave legacies for the future. 

When Ferguson reflects on the attitudes of Millennials and Gen Z today, histrionic as they are over thought-crimes and emotional offense, he admits the situation looks bleak. But he finds hope in what he calls “Generation T — kids who began to develop societal awareness during the presidency of Donald Trump. There, he already sees what he believes is a sense that “wokeness is boring and counterintuitive.” 

But he doesn’t believe their tendency to think in more levelheaded, fact-based terms than the generation just ahead of them will flourish without help. They need, he argues, new institutions dedicated to developing an active and well-organized citizenry. 

“There needs to be a strong sense of the citizens’ ability to organize outside the structures of the State,” Ferguson says. “Part of the answer is to build institutions. We have to be better organized. People who thought of themselves as conservatives or classical liberals were terribly badly organized and basically lost control of the universities. It wasn’t even that hard for the Left to take over the universities.”

It’s for this reason, that, though he’s personally an atheist, Ferguson believes so deeply in the power of religious community to breed civic responsibility. Part of the Left’s interest in destroying the influence of faith in something beyond government, he argues, is that it destroys the impulse to band together to protect individual freedoms. 

It’s also what inspired him to join Bari Weiss, Steven Pinker, Larry Summers, and other independent thinkers to found The University of Austin — a new academic institution dedicated to a “fearless pursuit of the truth.”

“I’m quite interested in this challenge of institution building,” Ferguson tells Shapiro, “You’ve done that [with The Daily Wire]. And that’s one of the things about you that I find most impressive.”

Near the end, Ferguson returns to Shapiro’s point that he’s not worried about dying so much as he’s worried about leaving such work unfinished.

“I’d like to be able to die knowing I’ve started a bunch of things,” he says. “Institutions that will keep going.”",https://www.dailywire.com/news/were-closer-to-a-really-big-war-than-most-civilians-want-to-face-historian-niall-ferguson-delivers-timely-predictions-on-ukraine-in-new-episode-of-the-search,"Weeks later, bombs began to fall in Kyiv.

8,MSNBC,Virginia: Say Bye To Your Power Bill If You Own A Home In....,I,"Power companies are fighting an uphill battle they are sure to lose and they’re blaming customers who are taking advantage of massive government savings programs. Specifically, they are blaming Virginia Solar Incentives that encourage homeowners to use clean energy by reducing solar power projects to $0 installations.

Until now, solar panels were less about saving money and more about environmental protection. In order to get more people to switch to clean solar energy the federal and state governments are highly incentivizing homeowners who live in specific zip codes to go solar with $1000’s of dollars in rebates and incentives that can cover 100% of the costs associated with a new solar panel installation.

When homeowners visit Energybillcruncher, many are shocked to learn that solar panels can be installed on their home with no upfront costs after rebates and solar incentives. You can find out which solar incentives are offered in your area by using your zip code. You can even use this tool to help calculate your savings by entering your utility provider and your average power bill. In many cases, customers are saving up to 50% on the cost of powering their home each year.

Solar panels are much cheaper today than they were 10 years ago, which means millions of homeowners that could not previously afford to do so are switching to solar. Virginia Homeowners that qualify for this new program no longer have to buy solar panels. With rebates being as high as they are, homeowners are able to drastically reduce their power bill without dealing with the upfront costs of installing solar panels.
