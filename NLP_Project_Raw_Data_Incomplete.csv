  Putin’s war in Ukraine ‘should concern every person on Earth’: Why political observers say the Russian invasion may foretell an era of global disorder

  In the post-World War II era, major countries kept the usage of force in check. But that may be changing, experts warn.

Could the war in Ukraine mark the beginning of a new era defined by global unrest and power grabs? That’s what some political observers are suggesting. In the days leading up to Russia’s invasion of its neighboring country, commentators and officials were framing a potential war as one with much larger implications — not just for Eastern Europe or all of Europe, but for all the world.

At heart is the concern that following a post-World War II period in which countries, especially superpowers, rarely imposed their will on others through military means, the Ukrainian war could signal a different — and decidedly more dangerous — approach. “The Russian threat to invade Ukraine should concern every person on Earth,” wrote historian and philosopher Yuval Noah Harari in The Economist. “If it again becomes normative for powerful countries to wolf down their weaker neighbors, it would affect the way people all over the world feel and behave.” Ulrich Speck, an expert on global order, expressed a similar sentiment to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, though he focused mainly on the Ukrainian situation’s implications for Europe. He noted that citizens of the continent had become accustomed to the idea of living in an era “where soft power replaced hard power and international law created the foundation of a mutually beneficial order.” And now? “All these assumptions are being questioned,” Speck said. “Old-style power politics are back.” David E. Sanger, White House and national security correspondent for the New York Times, said the stakes are “very real” in terms of the Ukrainian situation’s broader implications. He pointed to how international agreements, such as those via NATO, created since the fall of the Soviet Union, “have kept Europe secure.” In turn, “most Europeans, and frankly most Americans, have come to just assume (that’s) the way the world is organized.” But Russian president Vladimir Putin is upending that assumption, Sanger said: “Putin is using this moment and holding Ukraine hostage to say, ‘No, no, no … It may be the way the world was organized for the past 25 years, but it’s not the way we’re willing to have the world organized for the next 25.’” Frank Bruni, a contributing opinion writer to the Times, put it more bluntly, saying many of us had falsely come to believe that we had entered an “enlightened” — and essentially, war-free — era. “I don’t know if it’s a boomer thing, a modern thing, an elite thing or some other thing, but in my lifetime, in this country, among many of my generational peers, there has been a sense that people had learned particular lessons and were evolving past extremes of pettiness and barbarism, certainly in the corners of the globe deemed more enlightened,” Bruni wrote. Clearly, that’s not the case, Bruni added: “Embarrassment, vanity, viciousness: History never moves on or gets past these forces, which drove invasions and conquests in centuries past and will drive invasions and conquests in years to come.” It isn’t just political observers who are sounding such warning calls. So, too, are political officials. In a January speech in Berlin, U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said that allowing Russia to “violate those principles” of not using force to reshape political borders “would drag us all back to a much more dangerous and unstable time.” Blinken added that the Russian-Ukranian situation is “bigger than a conflict between two countries…. It’s a crisis with global consequences, and it requires global attention and action.”

            Russia will likely default with April 4 payment due of $2.2 billion, experts say
            

Investors breathed a sigh of relief last week after the Russian government made a $117 million interest payment on its foreign debt. But a much bigger payment comes due April 4 — to the tune of $2.2 billion — and creditors are far less optimistic Russia will pony up this time.

The Daily Wire,Colin Kaepernick Offering Free Autopsies For Families Of Those Killed In ‘Police-Related’…,I,"Colin Kaepernick Offering Free Autopsies For Families Of Those Killed In ‘Police-Related’ Incidents | The Daily WireThe Daily WireMenuCloseReadListenWatchDiscussShopSearchLoginJoin— News —Colin Kaepernick Offering Free Autopsies For Families Of Those Killed In ‘Police-Related’ IncidentsBy  Tim Pearce•Feb 25, 2022   DailyWire.com•FacebookTwitterMailKevin Winter/WireImage via Getty Images
Former NFL quarterback-turned-activist Colin Kaepernick is offering free secondary autopsies through his nonprofit for the family members of anyone killed in a “police-related” incident.Kaepernick is launching the initiative through his Know Your Rights Camp, which hosts a series of conferences aimed at younger people “to advance the liberation and well-being of Black and Brown communities through education, self-empowerment, mass-mobilization and the creation of new systems.” The activist said that offering free autopsies is a way to protect potential victims against the “prison industrial complex.”“We know that the prison industrial complex, which includes police and policing, strives to protect and serve its interests at all costs,” Kaepernick said, according to ESPN. “The Autopsy Initiative is one important step toward ensuring that family members have access to accurate and forensically verifiable information about the cause of death of their loved one in their time of need.”According to the Know Your Rights Camp website, the Autopsy Initiative’s goal is to “provide a second autopsy free-of-charge for victims’ families who have lost their loved ones due to a police-related death. The services offered through the Initiative include the completion of a second autopsy, disclosure of preliminary findings, and issuance of the final autopsy report.”The website continued:A police-related death occurs when an individual is harmed by police officers while using deadly force which results in the individual’s death. A police-related death includes in-custody deaths. In-custody deaths include deaths that arise during contact with law enforcement officers during arrest, pursuit, booking, transport, or incarceration. Therefore, pre-custody deaths are included within in-custody deaths. Our Initiative includes a team of board-certified pathologists. Our board-certified pathologists will work objectively, efficiently and, diligently while relying on established forensic principles when conducting the second autopsy. Our pathologists will actively seek the truth to provide the victims’ families with the most medically sound cause of death. The Autopsy Request may be completed by anyone with a close relationship with the victim, which may include the victim’s spouse, partner, relative, close friend, or lawyer. However, only the victim’s legal representative and/or other authorized individuals can legally authorize the autopsy. Kaepernick’s racial-justice activism took off after he kneeled for the national anthem before a game in 2016. He escalated his efforts in 2020 after the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in May 2020. In an essay several months later in October, Kaepernick called for the abolition of police and prisons.“The central intent of policing is to surveil, terrorize, capture, and kill marginalized populations, specifically Black folks,” Kaepernick wrote. “In order to eradicate anti-Blackness, we must also abolish the police. The abolition of one without the other is impossible.”The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

TV viewers are obsessed with the idea of a con gone wrong, and one of the biggest is the story of Elizabeth Holmes. The disgraced Theranos founder was once heralded as the fastest rising star in the healthcare industry, earning billions from venture capitalists to grow her company. Now, she’s facing up to 20 years in federal prison for multiple convictions of fraud. Holmes’s story is coming to Hulu soon as part of a miniseries called “The Dropout.”“Mean Girls” alum Amanda Seyfried is taking on the lead role despite turning down the opportunity at first. The actress spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about why she wasn’t hung up on recreating Holmes’s signature deep voice plus the reason she initially didn’t want to sign up for the project. Originally, “SNL” actress Kate McKinnon was slated to play Holmes, but she dropped out to join the miniseries “Joe vs Carole.” Seyfried got the offer to replace McKinnon and quickly turned it down.“Listen, I was having a f***ing moment, OK?” she told THR. “I had COVID. I was isolating in the basement of a gross townhouse in Savannah, Georgia, because my husband was working on a movie there. And now an L.A. shoot? Pass!”After giving the role some thought and consideration, Seyfried changed her mind and decided to give it a try. However, the actress swears she never tried to completely copy Holmes’s very deep voice. “I knew my voice was never going to be as deep as hers because I’m physically not capable of it,” Seyfried told the publication. “Besides, I promised I wasn’t going to give myself a hard time and try to completely mimic this other human being. It’d be impossible. And just not fun.”The subject of Holmes tricking some of the savviest people in business into believing she had a viable product has been explored before. There’s the best-seller “Bad Blood,” the documentary  “The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley,” and a popular podcast called “The Dropout,” which serves as a major contributor to the new Hulu miniseries.Despite learning everything there was to know about Holmes, Seyfried insists that the real person behind the con remains a mystery. “I watched and listened to all of it, but I learned nothing about her,” the actress said. “It’s crazy that she can still be such an enigma with all the information surrounding her.”Elsewhere in the article, screenwriter Elizabeth Meriwether discussed her hypothesis on how Holmes was able to trick so many people. “You hear a lot of, ‘How did she get all these men on board with the company? They must have been in love with her,’ ” Meriwether said. “That’s too simplistic an answer for why everything happened.”The miniseries seeks to delve deeper into Holmes’s motivations, not just what she did. “This is not just about showing all the points where this woman made bad choices,” Seyfried explained. “We’re investigating why we love a fall from grace, why we want to watch train wrecks.”“The Dropout” is just one in a long line of documentaries about Silicon Valley hotshots who ended up being not so hot after all. According to THR, other “upcoming Silicon Valley downfall dramas” include Showtime’s “Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber,” Apple TV+’s WeWork expose “WeCrashed” and HBO’s exploration into the Facebook indictment, “Doomsday Machine.” “The Dropout” premieres March 3 on Hulu.The Daily Wire’s first original film, Shut In, has made its cinematic debut, being met with rave reviews.

On Friday, United States District Judge for the District of Columbia, Reggie Walton, reportedly compared the actions of January 6 rioters at the U.S. Capitol to Russian forces invading Ukraine while sentencing the man who stole Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s lectern during the breach.Walton claimed the U.S. was on a “dangerous slide” and that the riot was what you would see in “banana republics” or “what we’re experiencing now in Ukraine.” The accused man, Adam Johnson from Florida, said he would not have tried to harm Pelosi, but rather he would have asked “for a selfie with her, if anything” had he ran into her that day.Johnson, the man who posed for a photograph that went viral as he waltzed through the U.S. Capitol building carrying Pelosi’s stolen lectern, was sentenced to 75 days in jail for his misdemeanor, ABC News’ Tampa Bay affiliate reported:Johnson pleaded guilty to one count of entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds and was sentenced by a federal judge in Washington, D.C. Friday. In addition to the jail sentence, Johnson was fined $5,000 and sentenced to 200 hours of community service. Because of time already served, Johnson only has to spend 60 more days in jail.According to Politico, Walton opined that the U.S. could end up in a war-torn future if the government doesn’t “do anything” to stop future events like January 6:In handing down the sentence, Judge Reggie Walton said the U.S. was headed in a dangerous direction if activities like the insurrection continue.“That’s what we see in countries, like what we’re experiencing now in Ukraine,” Judge Walton said, according to Politico. “That’s where we’re headed if we don’t do anything to stop it.”For his part, Johnson was apologetic and expressed his understanding that things would be very different for him had he pulled this sort of stunt in a foreign nation, NBC News reported:Johnson, speaking to the court on Friday, said he’d been “nothing but cooperative” with the government since his arrest, and said his actions demonstrated that he was apologetic and was “ashamed” to have been a part of the Capitol riot.Johnson said he recognized that if he did what he did in another country, he’d be “on a firing wall instead of a courtroom.” He claimed he had no intent to harm Pelosi.Johnson is a stay-at-home father of five, and admitted in court that he stole the lectern “because he believed it would make a good prop for a picture.”According to NBC News, “Johnson also admitted that he shouted that a bust of George Washington would be ‘a great battering ram’ as rioters attempted to break into the floor of the U.S. House, where members of Congress were still present.”As for what the world is “experiencing now in Ukraine,” as Walton referenced, there are currently thousands of Ukrainians are fleeing the country with dozens — potentially hundreds — of Russians and Ukrainians killed so far as Russia continues its full-scale attack on the Eastern European nation.The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

Democrat President Joe Biden’s administration turned over intelligence to communist China for months about Russia’s plans to invade Ukraine in an attempt to get China to convince Russia to not invade, according to a report.“Over three months, senior Biden administration officials held half a dozen urgent meetings with top Chinese officials in which the Americans presented intelligence showing Russia’s troop buildup around Ukraine and beseeched the Chinese to tell Russia not to invade,” The New York Times reported. “Each time, the Chinese officials, including the foreign minister and the ambassador to the United States, rebuffed the Americans, saying they did not think an invasion was in the works. After one diplomatic exchange in December, U.S. officials got intelligence showing Beijing had shared the information with Moscow, telling the Russians that the United States was trying to sow discord — and that China would not try to impede Russian plans and actions.”The report comes after Russia launched a full-scale invasion into Ukraine late this week and fighting has already reached the country’s capital city of Kyiv, although U.S. officials claim that Russia’s advance has been slowed down some by Ukrainian resistance.The meetings in which the Biden administration turned over intelligence to Beijing started after Biden held a video summit with Chinese dictator Xi Jinping in mid-November.The New York Times added:After the meeting, American officials decided that the Russian troop buildup around Ukraine presented the most immediate problem that China and the United States could try to defuse together. Some officials thought the outcome of the video summit indicated there was potential for an improvement in U.S.-China relations. Others were more skeptical, but thought it was important to leave no stone unturned in efforts to prevent Russia from attacking, one official said.Days later, White House officials met with the ambassador, Qin Gang, at the Chinese Embassy. They told the ambassador what U.S. intelligence agencies had detected: a gradual encirclement of Ukraine by Russian forces, including armored units. William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director, had flown to Moscow on Nov. 2 to confront the Russians with the same information, and on Nov. 17, American intelligence officials shared their findings with NATO.White House officials told China about the allegedly tough sanctions that they would impose on Russia and how those sanctions could negatively impact China because of China’s close ties with Russia. They also tried to persuade China that its global image could suffer.Their desperate attempts “went nowhere” and China’s Qin was reportedly acted “skeptical and suspicious,” according to The New York Times report.Related:13 Ukraine Soldiers Posthumously Awarded ‘Hero’ Title After Telling Russian Ship: ‘Go F*** Yourself’Woman Confronts Soldier In Viral Video: Put Sunflower Seeds In Your Pockets So When You Die Flowers GrowChinese Media Leaks Censoring Rules On Ukraine: We’ll Need Russian Support When We ‘Solve Taiwan Issue’The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

NATO activated the NATO Response Force for the first time ever on Friday in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion into Ukraine, which many critics have said is a result of weakness from Democrat President Joe Biden.“NATO Supreme Allied Commander Gen. Tod Wolters activated the multinational force consisting of land, air, sea and special operations forces from the allies that can deploy quickly in support of the NATO alliance,” CNN reported. “The entire NATO Response Force is 40,000 troops but [NATO Secretary General Jens] Stoltenberg did not say how many would be activated.”Stoltenberg warned during a press conference on Friday that Putin’s “objectives are not limited to Ukraine.”German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht described Putin as acting “highly unpredictable,” worrying that he may attack NATO countries.“We have a residual hope that he will not cross further borders,” she said. “But I have to say, honestly: that is no certainty.”Germany’s defence minister Lambrecht concerned that a “highly unpredictable” Putin may not hold back from attacking NATO states: “We have a residual hope that he will not cross further borders. But I have to say, honestly: that is no certainty.” https://t.co/ql5hG2xNVe— Jeremy Cliffe (@JeremyCliffe) February 25, 2022Wolters said that NATO has forces operating in the maritime, land, air, space, and cyber domains that are actively working to defend NATO’s sovereignty.“This is an historic moment and the very first time the Alliance has employed these high readiness forces in a deterrence and defense role. They represent a flexible, combat credible force that can be employed in multiple ways and we are utilizing fully their inherent agility,” he said. “These deterrence measures are prudent and enhance our speed, responsiveness and capability to shield and protect the one billion citizens we swore to protect. We are grateful to our allies Canada and the United States for their recent commitments to deploy an additional 7,460 troops, including an armored brigade combat team, artillery units, a naval frigate, and surveillance aircraft, to support this Alliance-wide effort.”“As NATO establishes this enhanced vigilance on the Alliance’s eastern flank, Allied military forces will posture and exercise to increase our readiness and interoperability. Your soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines stand ready to protect every meter of Allied territory,” he continued. “We admire the courage and tenacity of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and citizens in defending their country. The Alliance remains steadfast in our collective commitment to shield and protect each other. Moving forward, we are prepared to leverage the strength of all our forces to defend the Alliance.”Related:Biden Turned Over Intelligence To China On Russia’s Plans To Invade Ukraine, China Gave It To Russia, Report Says13 Ukraine Soldiers Posthumously Awarded ‘Hero’ Title After Telling Russian Ship: ‘Go F*** Yourself’Woman Confronts Soldier In Viral Video: Put Sunflower Seeds In Your Pockets So When You Die Flowers GrowThis report has been updated to include additional information. The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

Videos of injured citizens and tanks rolling into Ukraine are making the horror of Russia’s invasion palpable even for people living thousands of miles away. But a video featuring some of the most defenseless Ukrainian citizens is among the most heartbreaking footage to come out of conflict so far. The clip highlights the depth of fear and helplessness among the population.According to The Daily Mail, the video was captured by medical staff as they helped around one dozen newborn babies settle into what appears to be a storage closet inside a makeshift bomb shelter. Prior to being relocated, the newborns were patients at Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Children’s Clinical Hospital in Dnipro, which is located in Eastern Ukraine. The city became a target of missile strikes shortly after Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of the neighboring country began. Premature and other vulnerable babies were among those evacuated to the basement for safety during the bombing. The NICU, which stands for Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, is where premature or ill newborn babies go for extra care ranging from feeding tubes to ventilators, which help the babies stay alive.Newborn infants from the neonatal intensive care unit at a children’s hospital in Dnipro, in eastern Ukraine, were moved into a makeshift bomb shelter on a lower level of the building on Thursday. https://t.co/l8RAcFMTud pic.twitter.com/kWud9ktt2P— The New York Times (@nytimes) February 25, 2022Footage shows NICU nurses tending to the babies with several of them rocking and comforting the newborns, who are wrapped in colorful blankets and sleeping quietly. Medical staff members are seen on video helping use inflatable bags to deliver air, with some nurses even smiling amid the danger.“This is the NICU. In a bomb shelter. Can you imagine?” Dr. Denis Surkov, chief of the neonatal unit wrote to the New York Times in a text message. “This is our reality.” The babies were moved to the makeshift bomb shelter after bombing began Thursday morning as a necessary precaution.   “We were nervous, very confused,” Dr. Surkov continued. Ukraine’s foreign minister criticized Russia’s aggressive invasion of Ukraine on Thursday, calling it “beyond evil” that hospitals were among the targets of the strikes.Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter, “Consider this: Putin has launched a massive war of aggression in Europe during a still raging pandemic. On top of that, Russians bomb Ukrainian hospitals now. This is beyond evil. The only moral choice any government can make now is to support Ukraine by all means.”The video of fragile newborns is only one of many tragic images to come out of the early days of the Russian invasion. Footage of a man saying goodbye to his daughter as she evacuated to safety moved many people to tears. The video shows the father bending down to hug the little girl goodbye and straighten her winter hat before breaking down into sobs. The child also cries as the two embrace one last time before she boards a bus, which is likely headed to a safer location.There’s also a shocking video that reportedly shows a military tank running over an occupied car in Kyiv as horrified citizens look on. The driver of the car miraculously survived the incident. Unfortunately, these video clips are unlikely to be the last harrowing footage that comes out of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

When they sat down over coffee for the new Daily Wire series, “The Search,” podcaster Ben Shapiro and renowned historian Niall Ferguson couldn’t have known just how timely their interview would prove to be. During a roving discussion taped in late January in Palm Beach, the pair dissected the United States’ inability to properly weigh risk when it comes to foreign policy and what that fecklessness might mean to China and Russia. With a now-eerie prescience, the Hoover Institute fellow tells Shapiro that, based on his knowledge of world skirmishes over the last 100 years, the Biden administration’s weakness on the international stage will undoubtedly lead Russia to launch an attack on Ukraine. “The threat of sanctions is not going to stop Putin invading Ukraine,” he says with surety. “I still think it’s quite likely that he will increase his military aggression towards Ukraine because financial sanctions are not an effective deterrent, and I don’t think they’re an effective deterrent against the Chinese, either.”Weeks later, bombs began to fall in Kyiv. The West’s bizarre overreaction to the marginal danger posed by COVID-19 compared to its apathy toward the serious threats China and Russia present dominates much of the 90-minute dialogue, available to Daily Wire subscribers. “This is one of the odd things about safetyism — the cult of treating all risks as incredibly high,” Ferguson points out. “Oddly enough, it desensitizes you to the real risks. And I think the U.S. has become pathologically incapable of thinking realistically about risk.”How this has manifested, he explains, is with federal authorities pushing to mask children and force vaccines on young people who face almost no danger from the coronavirus while blithely ignoring the fact that the world’s most powerful authoritarian regimes have suddenly begun behaving as allies. “We’re closer to a really big war than most civilians want to face,” he concludes.Legacies Over RiskThe looming reality of seismic geopolitical events leads the friends to reflect on just how endemic distorted perspectives have become in America. Ferguson says working on his last book, “Doom: The Politics of Catastrophe,” made him realize that, while fear of a virus might have highlighted the problem, defective public choice has been around for at least 20 years. Generations ago, he explains, both the public and the federal government were better at assessing risk because they had no choice. “I mean, coming out of the 1930s and 40s, you confronted some very profound risks, nuclear war being the biggest,” he says. “But my sense is that the further away we got from World War II, the less good our elites have been at assessing risk and the more inclined they have been to say, ‘Why worry about probabilities? Let’s assume that everything is a huge risk. And then let’s design extraordinarily complex regulations to prevent risk.’” The unrealistic goal, he argues, appears to be to prevent death.For Shapiro, this shallowness that views the mere preservation of life as the greatest objective also explains our current national obsession with identity, as well as the epidemic of mental health issues plaguing younger generations. He points out with a bit of gallows humor that such a value structure can’t help but breed a culture-wide sense of meaninglessness and unfulfillment. “Like if [assassins] get me in the Everglades, honestly, they deserve it,” he jokes about a recent vacation with his family, where it dawned on him that if his haters were to successfully gun him down (as online trolls have threatened to do over the years), he’d have to give them credit for their marksmanship. “Like if they get that shot and they nail me and I’m floating among the mangroves and alligators,” he laughs, “I’ll just have to give them credit. Like, really, that’s an excellent hit.” What’s clear a moment later is Shapiro’s dark amusement comes from his deep sense of mission, his conviction that his life has a greater purpose than merely preserving his heart-beat. Like the men who founded the nation, he says he cares more about building something of lasting value than in being physically safe.“My dad used to be kind of paranoid about [me voicing my political opinions],” Shapiro reveals, “and he used to say, ‘Are you sure you want to say this about Islamists or are you sure you want to say this about the Chinese?’ Shapiro’s answer: “Yeah, I am. I mean, at a certain point, you’ve got to say what you’re going to say.” Because that’s what it takes, he argues, to build institutions that have the potential to transform a society from one in which happiness is found in the arbitrary notion of feeling personally “affirmed” to one in which meaning is derived from accomplishment.“If the ages have taught us anything,” Shapiro says, “it’s that your happiness has very little to do with how you sit on a given day and has a lot more to do with whether you’re building things of consequence.”Building InstitutionsThough their critics often like to pretend otherwise, over the course of the discussion both Ferguson and Shapiro are clear that their hope for the future doesn’t lie solely in winning elections or “owning” libs, but in creating organizations that leave legacies for the future. When Ferguson reflects on the attitudes of Millennials and Gen Z today, histrionic as they are over thought-crimes and emotional offense, he admits the situation looks bleak. But he finds hope in what he calls “Generation T — kids who began to develop societal awareness during the presidency of Donald Trump. There, he already sees what he believes is a sense that “wokeness is boring and counterintuitive.” But he doesn’t believe their tendency to think in more levelheaded, fact-based terms than the generation just ahead of them will flourish without help. They need, he argues, new institutions dedicated to developing an active and well-organized citizenry. “There needs to be a strong sense of the citizens’ ability to organize outside the structures of the State,” Ferguson says. “Part of the answer is to build institutions. We have to be better organized. People who thought of themselves as conservatives or classical liberals were terribly badly organized and basically lost control of the universities. It wasn’t even that hard for the Left to take over the universities.”It’s for this reason, that, though he’s personally an atheist, Ferguson believes so deeply in the power of religious community to breed civic responsibility. Part of the Left’s interest in destroying the influence of faith in something beyond government, he argues, is that it destroys the impulse to band together to protect individual freedoms. It’s also what inspired him to join Bari Weiss, Steven Pinker, Larry Summers, and other independent thinkers to found The University of Austin — a new academic institution dedicated to a “fearless pursuit of the truth.”“I’m quite interested in this challenge of institution building,” Ferguson tells Shapiro, “You’ve done that [with The Daily Wire]. And that’s one of the things about you that I find most impressive.”Near the end, Ferguson returns to Shapiro’s point that he’s not worried about dying so much as he’s worried about leaving such work unfinished.“I’d like to be able to die knowing I’ve started a bunch of things,” he says. “Institutions that will keep going.”The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

MSNBC,Virginia: Say Bye To Your Power Bill If You Own A Home In....,I,"Virginia Policy Makes Going Solar Easy For Homeowners


AdvertisementSave up to 50% on Your Power Bill, See Your Savings »Home Solar System$VirginiaSave with Solar PanelsVirginia Policy Makes Going Solar Easy For HomeownersCongress Extends Solar Incentives Through 2022David MillerJanuary 4th, 2022
Power companies are fighting an uphill battle they are sure to lose and they’re blaming customers who are taking advantage of massive government savings programs. Specifically, they are blaming Virginia Solar Incentives that encourage homeowners to use clean energy by reducing solar power projects to $0 installations.
Until now, solar panels were less about saving money and more about environmental protection. In order to get more people to switch to clean solar energy the federal and state governments are highly incentivizing homeowners who live in specific zip codes to go solar with $1000’s of dollars in rebates and incentives that can cover 100% of the costs associated with a new solar panel installation.
When homeowners visit Energybillcruncher, many are shocked to learn that solar panels can be installed on their home with no upfront costs after rebates and solar incentives. You can find out which solar incentives are offered in your area by using your zip code. You can even use this tool to help calculate your savings by entering your utility provider and your average power bill. In many cases, customers are saving up to 50% on the cost of powering their home each year.

How Do Solar Programs Work?
Solar panels are much cheaper today than they were 10 years ago, which means millions of homeowners that could not previously afford to do so are switching to solar. Virginia Homeowners that qualify for this new program no longer have to buy solar panels. With rebates being as high as they are, homeowners are able to drastically reduce their power bill without dealing with the upfront costs of installing solar panels.

Word got back to Markle, and she was so grateful that she sent him her thanks, which he framed. On Friday, he commented.""This is true,"" he wrote as he retweeted the story.

She has very nice penmanship btw. https://t.co/oBF1SDbhqo— Simon Rex (@SimonRex) March 18, 2022The two had met when they both appeared on the same show in March 2005. It was an episode of the short-lived UPN sitcom Cuts, which aired for two seasons in 2005 and 2006. They co-starred alongside cast members including Shannon Elizabeth and Shondrella Avery. And the closest they ever got, the newspaper noted, was a platonic lunch. So, for Rex, it was a hard no, no matter how desperate he was for cash.""I was broke as f***! I really needed the money,"" Rex said. ""But I'll be on food stamps before I do that.""The note of gratitude that he received said simply, ""It's nice to know there are still good people."" He was such a fan that he gave it a permanent spot on the wall of his home in California's Joshua Tree area.Cuts was one of Markle's first TV appearances. She appeared on some other projects, including 90210 and Fringe, before becoming a cast member on USA legal drama Suits, which debuted in 2011. Markle left the series in 2018, weeks before marrying Prince Harry.

On Sunday, Babylon Bee CEO Seth Dillon revealed that his company, known for its satirical takes on politics and culture, has been locked out of its Twitter account for “hateful conduct.”“I just received this notice that we’ve been locked out of our account for ‘hateful conduct,’” Dillion tweeted Sunday afternoon.Twitter’s action came over The Babylon Bee’s piece from five days ago, jokingly naming Health and Human Services (HHS) Assistant Secretary Rachel Levine as “Man of the Year.”Levine, a biological man, is best known for coming out as a transgender female before being appointed by President Joe Biden to the role of assistant secretary for the HHS. Recently, Levine was named one of USA Today’s “Women of the Year.”Twitter flagged the Bee’s post poking fun at Levine’s transition and name change for violating its rules against “hateful conduct.” The rule states, “You may not promote violence against, threaten, or harass other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease.”Dillon wrote that Twitter told the Bee that the account could be restored 12 hours after the company deletes the tweet linking to the article on Levine. Dillon told his followers that they don’t plan on deleting the tweet. “We’re not deleting anything. Truth is not hate speech. If the cost of telling the truth is the loss of our Twitter account, then so be it,” he wrote.I just received this notice that we’ve been locked out of our account for “hateful conduct.” pic.twitter.com/udMriKcDr6— Seth Dillon (@SethDillon) March 20, 2022On Saturday, The Daily Wire reported that Twitter took action against a tweet from Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who, like The Babylon Bee, referred to Levine as a man. On Thursday, Paxton posted a screenshot of the USA Today article naming Levine as one of its “Women of the Year” and commented, “Rachel Levine is a man.” Twitter flagged the tweet as being hateful, but allowed it to remain, stating, “This tweet violated the Twitter Rules about hateful conduct. However, Twitter has determined that it may be in the public’s interest for the tweet to remain accessible.”Paxton followed Twitter’s flagging by releasing a statement on Big Tech censorship Friday. He wrote:Yesterday I stated an irrefutable scientific fact: Rachel Levine is a man. I pointed this out after USA Today named him a “Woman” of the Year. But Levine is not a woman. He has one X and one Y chromosome and other male-sex characteristics. I just follow the science.For simply saying this matter-of-factly, Twitter blocked it as “hateful.” Users can now only access my statement through a trigger-warning filter. And even then, users can neither like it nor comment on it. At the same time, hundreds of other verified accounts saying the exact same thing remain untouched and unfiltered.This whole insane episode represents a two-pronged attack from the left — both of which I’m vigorously fighting against. First is the left’s war against human biology, and especially against women. Second is their weaponization of Big Tech against conservative voices.But Big Tech is not only anti-conservative and anti-Republican. It is now apparently anti-truth and anti-science. I will continue to use all my power to hold them accountable. Even now, I’m exploring legal options to stop their one-sided censorship.The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

Twitter users across the political spectrum excoriated Bloomberg News for an opinion column suggesting low income Americans find ways to lower their costs to deal with skyrocketing inflation.The column, titled “Inflation Stings Most If You Earn Less Than $300K. Here’s How to Deal,” was written by Teresa Ghilarducci, a professor of economics at the New School for Social Research, a private university in New York. In it, she explains that inflation, especially soaring gas prices, will do much less harm to Americans who earn more than $289,000 per year. For those near the median income of around $50,000, or less, decisions will be much harder, Ghilarducci wrote.“If your income is more than $289,000 a year, the run-up in gas prices may be alarming — but it’s unlikely to hammer your overall finances,” Ghilarducci wrote. “For those earning much less, it’s a different story.”“I expect those most affected will adjust to inflation in the classic way by shifting away from relatively expensive items toward close substitutes,” she continued. “Here are some ideas on how to reconfigure consumption and lessen the blow. But again, adjustment is hard for people without savings or choices.”Ghilarducci’s suggestions included:taking public transportation instead of driving;buying and eating meat subsitutes like lentils and vegetables;avoiding buying items in bulk;avoiding unnecessary charges; andavoiding medical expenses for petsBloomberg tweeted a link to the article Saturday. “Inflation stings most if you earn less than $300K,” the tweet read. “Here’s how to deal:➡️ Take the bus

On Sunday, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky sparked outrage when he compared the Russian invasion of Ukraine to the Holocaust during a speech to the Israeli government.“This Russian invasion of Ukraine is not just a military operation, as Moscow claims. This is a large-scale and treacherous war aimed at destroying our people. Destroying our children, our families. Our state. Our cities. Our communities. Our culture. And everything that makes Ukrainians Ukrainians. Everything that Russian troops are now destroying. Deliberately. In front of the whole world,” Zelensky said. “That is why I have the right to this parallel and to this comparison. Our history and your history. Our war for our survival and World War II.”“Listen to what the Kremlin says. Just listen! There are even terms that sounded then. And this is a tragedy. When the Nazi party raided Europe and wanted to destroy everything. Destroy everyone. Wanted to conquer the nations. And leave nothing from us, nothing from you. Even the name and the trace. They called it ‘the final solution to the Jewish issue.’ You remember that. And I’m sure you will never forget!” Zelensky added. “But listen to what is sounding now in Moscow. Hear how these words are said again: ‘Final solution.’ But already in relation, so to speak, to us, to the ‘Ukrainian issue.’”“I appreciate the President of Ukraine and support the Ukrainian people in heart and deed, but it is impossible to rewrite the terrible history of the Holocaust,” Israel’s Communications Minister Yoaz Hendel tweeted. “Genocide was also committed on Ukrainian soil. The war is terrible, but the comparison to the horrors of the Holocaust and the final solution is outrageous.”“If Zelensky’s speech was given… in normal [non-war] times, we would have said it bordered on Holocaust denial… Every comparison between a regular war, as difficult as it may be, and the extermination of millions of Jews in gas chambers in the framework of the Final Solution, is a total distortion of history. The same is true for the claim that Ukrainians helped Jews in the Holocaust… The historic truth is that the Ukrainian people cannot be proud of its behavior in the Holocaust of the Jews,” Yuval Steinitz, a Likud MK, said. “None of that changes the fact that despite the outrageous use of the Holocaust, we must continue humanitarian aid to the citizens of Ukraine suffering from the war and pray for its end to come soon.”“I don’t understand Ukrainian, but if the translation I heard is accurate, Zelensky asked us to treat the Ukrainians like they treated us 80 years ago. I’m sorry, but I think we will have to reject that request. We are, after all, a moral nation,” said Simcha Rothman, a Religious Zionist MK, on the subject of Zelensky’s reference to Ukrainians who saved Jews during the Holocaust.“It is sounded openly. This is a tragedy. Once again, it was said at a meeting in Moscow. It is available on official websites. This was quoted in the state media of Russia. Moscow says so: without the war against us, they would not be able to ensure a ‘final solution’ allegedly for their own security. Just like it was said 80 years ago,” Zelensky said later in his speech, before urging Israel to share its Iron Dome technology.“Everyone in Israel knows that your missile defense is the best. It is powerful. Everyone knows that your weapon is strong. Everyone knows you’re doing great. You know how to defend your state interests, the interests of your people. And you can definitely help us protect our lives, the lives of Ukrainians, the lives of Ukrainian Jews,” Zelensky said. “One can keep asking why we can’t get weapons from you. Or why Israel has not imposed strong sanctions against Russia. Why it doesn’t put pressure on Russian business. But it is up to you, dear brothers and sisters, to choose the answer. And you will have to live with this answer, people of Israel.”“Ukrainians have made their choice. 80 years ago. They rescued Jews. That is why the Righteous Among the Nations are among us,” Zelensky concluded. “People of Israel, now you have such a choice.”Related:Zelensky Compares Russian Invasion Of Ukraine To Holocaust In Speech To Israel’s GovernmentIan Haworth is a writer for The Daily Wire and contributor to Morning Wire.

A military convoy carrying up to six nuclear warheads was spotted late last week moving through Scotland, which comes as war between Russia and Ukraine rages on and Russian President Vladimir Putin has put his nuclear forces on high alert following his invasion.“The convoy was carrying up to six nuclear warheads only a mile south of Glasgow city centre, heading to Royal Naval Armaments Depot Coulport on Loch Long, according to NukeWatch, an organization that tracks and monitors the convoys that transport the UK’s Trident nuclear warheads,” the Daily Mail reported. “The nuclear-armed convoy passed over Erskine Bridge, heading up along the M6 motorway near Kendal, before being spotted on the M74 at Lesmahagow and arriving in Loch Long at approximately 11:30pm on Saturday.”“I think there were four warhead carriers I believe. Our reckoning is that each of those trucks can carry two but one of the trucks is empty as a spare in case [sic] breaks down,” Nukewatch UK Campaigner Jane Tallents told a local publication. “So if there’s four we expect there to be six warheads, or up to six warheads anyway.”The organization claimed that the most likely reason that the warheads were transferred was for maintenance purposes, and not to prepare for their use in battle.“I don’t think this convoy is of any more concern than the fact that we are always, 24/7, armed and ready to start a nuclear war,” Tallents said. “All the things that some of us have worried about constantly since the 60s, they come to pass really. People have forgotten about it but they are there.”The move comes as the war in Ukraine has nearly reached the one-month mark since Russian forces invaded.Shortly after Putin invaded Ukraine, he ordered the country’s nuclear forces be put on high alert.“Citing ‘aggressive statements’ by NATO and tough financial sanctions, Putin issued a directive to increase the readiness of Russia’s nuclear weapons, raising fears that the invasion of Ukraine could lead to nuclear war, whether by design or mistake,” the Associated Press reported. “The Russian leader is ‘potentially putting in play forces that, if there’s a miscalculation, could make things much, much more dangerous,’ said a senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss rapidly unfolding military operations.”U.S. officials now warn that Putin may brandish nuclear threats as the war is not going in his favor with Ukrainian forces grinding the Russian military’s advances to a halt.“Protracted occupation of parts of Ukrainian territory threatens to sap Russian military manpower and reduce their modernized weapons arsenal, while consequent economic sanctions will probably throw Russia into prolonged economic depression and diplomatic isolation,” Lieutenant General Scott Berrier, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said in a report. “As this war and its consequences slowly weaken Russian conventional strength. Russia likely will increasingly rely on its nuclear deterrent to signal the West and project strength to its internal and external audiences.”The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

Tilton/Getty Images)
After days of silence from most female athletes at the NCAA Women’s Swimming Championships, a young woman whose finals spot was stolen from her by a biologically male swimmer is speaking out.“My name is Reka Gyorgy from Hungary. I am a 2016 Rio Olympian, represented Virginia Tech for the past 5 years, a 2 time ACC champion, 2 time All-American and 3 time honorable mention All-American,” wrote Virginia Tech swimmer Reka Gyorgy in a letter to the NCAA that she posted on Instagram.“With all due respect, I would like to address something that is a problem in our sport right now and hurting athletes, especially swimmers,” wrote Gyorgy. “Everyone has heard and known about transgender [swimmer], Lia Thomas, and her case including all the issues and concerns that her situation brought into our sport.”Gyorgy wrote that she respects and fully stands with Thomas and is convinced that Thomas is “no different” than Gyorgy herself or any other Division 1 swimmer who has worked hard their entire swimming career.“She is doing what she is passionate about and deserves that right,” wrote Gyorgy. “On the other hand, I would like to critique the NCAA rules that allow her to compete against us, who are biologically women.”“I’m writing this letter right now in hopes that the NCAA will open their eyes and change these rules in the future. It doesn’t promote our sport in a good way and I think it is disrespectful against the biologically female swimmers who are competing in the NCAA.”Gyorgy said that she swam the 500 free at the NCAA’s on Thursday where she placed 17th — meaning that she did not make it back to the finals and was a first alternate.“I’m a 5th year senior, I have been top 16 and top 8 before and I know how much of a privilege it is to make finals at a meet this big,” she said. “This is my last college meet ever and I feel frustrated. It feels like that final spot was taken away from me because of the NCAA’s decision to let someone who is not a biological female compete.”“I know you could say I had the opportunity to swim faster and make the top 16, but this situation makes it a bit different and I can’t help but be angry or sad. It hurts me, my ear and other women in the pool. One spot was taken away from the girl who got 9th in the 500 free and didn’t make it back to the A final preventing her from being an All-American. Every event that transgender athletes competed in was one spot taken away from biological females throughout the meet.”Gyorgy wrote that the “NCAA knew what was coming this past week. They knew opinions and minds will be divided and chose to do nothing.”“This week has been more about reporters, media and division in our sport than things like two women going under 21 seconds in the 50 freestyle, 3 women going under 50 seconds in the 100 butterfly and the first woman IN HISTORY to go under 48 seconds in the 100 backstroke,” she added.“Thursday was not a specific athlete’s fault. It is the result of the NCAA and their lack of interest in protecting their athletes,” she continued.“I ask that the NCAA takes time to think about all the other biological women in swimming, try to think how they would feel if they would be in our shoes,” she said. “Make the right changes for our sport and for a better future in swimming.”The NCAA did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Daily Wire.The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

MSNBC guest Elie Mystal, who also serves as justice correspondent at The Nation, said on Saturday that the hardest part of Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson’s hearings — for her — would likely be refraining from punching Republicans in the mouth.Mystal joined host Tiffany Cross on “The Cross Connection,” where he argued that Jackson’s credentials were impeccable and the only things any Republicans had against her were “racism and disgusting innuendo.”As Mediaite reported, Cross began the segment by asking Mystal what he expected to come out of the hearings, scheduled to start Monday — and she suggested that what Republicans were angling for was a “viral moment” that they could use to smear Judge Jackson in the court of public opinion.“I’m curious, Elie, what do you anticipate to come out of these hearings? Because you know, they’re going to be vying for a viral moment on the Republican side,” Cross said. “And what would you say is the biggest challenge to Judge Jackson’s confirmation, if any, given that Democrats have the majority?”“The biggest challenge is her not getting out of her chair and punching one of these fools in the mouth,” Mystal said of the Republicans who were likely to challenge her. “Like, that’s the hardest thing, because all they have for her right now is racism and disgusting innuendo. Like, they don’t have… They don’t have anything on her record.”Mystal went on to note that Judge Jackson had been on the court for nine years, arguing that Republicans were not contesting her decisions in “hundreds and hundreds of cases” and were not making “substantive legal arguments about her actual decision-making process.”“All they’ve got is the racism, they want to know about the LSAT scores. Some of them are going to call her an affirmative action nominee,” Mystal continued, referencing criticisms directed primarily at President Joe Biden for his outright statement that he was going to choose a black woman, to the exclusion of all other demographics. “Some of them are going to ask her why she’s not sad that good white people weren’t considered for the job. That’s literally what they have.”Mystal then pivoted to address Senator Josh Hawley, who raised questions earlier in the week about Jackson’s record in dealing with child pornography and sex offender cases.“But like, that’s, the challenge will just be keeping her cool because if she keeps her cool, which I’m sure she will do,” Mystal concluded. “We’re talking about a high school debate champion and, you know, a person who has prepared her whole life for these four days. As long as she keeps her cool, she should do fine because she’s so eminently qualified and impeccably credentialed that they don’t really have anything on her.”The White House has responded to Hawley’s accusations, saying, that they amounted to “toxic and weakly-presented misinformation that relies on taking cherry-picked elements of her record out of context.”The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

Abortion activist Rihanna reflected on what she’s called her “rebellious” maternity style and admitted she’s basically “challenged” herself to “push it further” than others had before.The 34-year-old singer, a President Joe Biden supporter, has done the opposite of what most women do during pregnancy. Instead of the singer wearing outfits that consist of baggy clothes and looks that cover up her belly, she’s worn tops that show off her baby bump, even accessorizing it.During a recent press event at an ULTA beauty store in Los Angeles, the “Umbrella” hitmaker showed up wearing a metallic silver cropped top with a low-rise sparkling skirt. She completed the look with her hair up in a ponytail and a silver belly chain.“It’s been me personally saying, I’m not going to buy maternity clothes,” the superstar singer shared, reported Bustle in a recent piece. “I’m not gonna buy maternity pants, jeans, dresses, or [do] whatever society told me to do before.”“When I saw women dress during their pregnancy [in the past], I’d think that that was the only way,” she added, noting she called her style “rebellious.” “So, I challenged myself to push it further and really just have fun with [maternity style]. Because there’s nothing more fun than a challenge for me.”“Like that’s where I get creative,” the “Diamonds” hitmaker continued. “That’s where I’m forced to come up with new ideas and new ways to make it work.”Rihanna’s social media account is filled with numerous examples of these strange maternity looks that can be seen here, posted since she revealed in January she was expecting her first child with rapper boyfriend A$AP Rocky, reported People magazine.The outfits range from a black lace-up top and low-cut pants in one shot to a teal blue one-shoulder body suit — complete with a cutout that showed off her bump. Other looks even included a mini skirt, bikini top, leather jacket and thigh-high boots. To say the looks were daring would be a serious understatement. View this post on Instagram A post shared by badgalriri (@badgalriri)The singer, born Robyn Rihanna Fenty, admitted she’s enjoyed the boost of creativity and said she didn’t “want it to end.” She has also spoken about how proud she is to be creating a life — despite her years of support for abortion access.“There’s going to be the other side of pregnancy, which is like your ‘snap back’ body, and that’s going to be a challenge in and of itself,” Fenty explained. “So I’m looking forward to being creative in that [stage] as well.”The “We Found Love” hitmaker’s been praised for her unique maternity looks by such stars as Kim Kardashian, Victoria’s Secret models and more.“OMGGGGGG,” “The Kardashians” star wrote on in a post on Instagram, reported E!

The Biden administration’s Justice Department remains committed to looking at “every possible civil rights violation that could have happened that led to the death of Breonna Taylor,” more than two years after the controversial shooting, according to famed attorney Ben Crump.Crump and Taylor’s mother, Tamika Palmer, met with representatives of the Department of Justice on Monday, more than 700 days after Taylor died in crossfire between police officers and Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker. “They affirm that they are looking under every stone” for possible rights violations in the case.Rumors swirled after the March 2020 shootout, which took place as members of the Louisville Metro Police Department served a warrant at Taylor’s apartment due to her alleged connection to a suspected drug dealer. Many of those tales were spread by Crump, according to one of the officers involved in the raid, retired LMPD Sgt. John Mattingly.Crump fits the model of a “grimy defense attorney,” who “seems to sniff out the national stories that can make him a buck, get some screen time, and gain him more notoriety,” Mattingly writes in his new book, “12 Seconds In The Dark: A Police Officer’s Firsthand Account of the Breonna Taylor Raid.” He “gets on TV like a televangelist and piggybacks the tragedies these families are going through.” Mattingly says the Taylor case was no exception. “Crump made his usual rounds on national television making false and slanderous allegations about the events of March 13 and the officers involved.”He started the false narrative that Breonna Taylor was asleep in her bed when she was killed. He said we didn’t knock or announce and in fact he claimed we changed our story from no-knock to knock and announce to fit our narrative. He claimed they called 911 as we were busting the door down, which is an absolute lie. … He said we were in plain clothes, which is true, but it’s misguided because he leaves out the fact we were clearly identified as POLICE with raid vests. Crump claimed we were at the wrong house and the suspect we were looking for was already in custody: 100 percent lies.“Crump is very good at tying tragedies and injustices together to skew the narrative and hype up a crowd,” Mattingly concluded.Walker shot Mattingly in the leg as he opened the door. Mattingly sets the record straight in his book, as well as in an exclusive interview with this author for The Daily Wire.Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron similarly blasted Crump’s sensationalist manner after the grand jury dismissed charges against every police officer involved in the shooting, except wanton endangerment charges against Brett Hankinson, on September 23, 2020.“This is the Ben Crump model,” Cameron said. “He goes into a city, creates a narrative, cherry-picks facts to establish, to prove that narrative, creates chaos in a community, misrepresents the facts, and then he leaves with his money, and then asks the community to pick up the pieces. It is terribly offensive on his part to push such narratives, such falsehoods.”A jury of his peers found Hankinson not guilty of wanton endangerment earlier this month, returning a verdict in just three hours. Hankinson testified that when he heard gunshots fired in the apartment, he believed Walker was executing his fellow officers.But Crump says he has found a receptive audience in the Biden administration. “We got an affirmation that the Department of Justice is not swayed with what happens with state charges,” Crump told the media.At a joint press conference, Tamika Palmer said, “The most important thing is to remember that Breonna didn’t deserve this.” Mattingly, who expresses deep compassion for Taylor’s family in his book, agrees that Taylor did not deserve her fate, but he blames her boyfriend, Walker, for opening fire unprovoked, then leaving his girlfriend alone as police returned fire while he dove into an adjacent bedroom like a “coward.”The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

A group of Iranian-backed extremists that Democrat President Joe Biden removed from the official Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) list reportedly launched attacks against Saudi Arabia over the weekend.“The Saudi-led coalition said early on Sunday that the Iran-aligned Houthi group launched four attacks on the kingdom that damaged civilian cars and homes but caused no casualties,” Reuters reported. “Saudi state news agency (SPA) said one attack targeted a water desalination plant in the city of Al-Shaqeeq, an Aramco facility in Jizan, a power station in the southern Dhahran al Janub city, and a gas facility in Khamis Mushait.”The Saudi-led coalition said that the latest attack included the use of ballistic missiles, drones, and cruise missiles. They said that they were monitoring enemy drone activity and had shot down a ballistic missile that targeted civilians.BREAKING: pictures of damages caused to civilian facilities by Houthi terrorist attacks targeting water desalination plant in Al-Shaqeeq and the Aramco facility in Jazan, Saudi Arabia  – (pics via @SPAregions ) pic.twitter.com/NfFRbPo4WM— حسن سجواني 🇦🇪 Hassan Sajwani (@HSajwanization) March 19, 2022The Trump administration designated the Houthis, also known as Ansarallah, as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) and a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) under the leadership of former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The Biden administration quickly reversed the terrorist designation after taking over in early 2021.The Council on Foreign Relations noted:The main defense of the Trump administration decision to call the Houthis terrorists is that they repeatedly commit acts of terrorism. QED. And the main critique of the Biden administration’s revocation of that decision is equally simple: the Houthis have long committed, and continue to commit, acts of terror. They should be designated an FTO because they are an FTO.“These designations will provide additional tools to confront terrorist activity and terrorism by Ansarallah, a deadly Iran-backed militia group in the Gulf region,” Pompeo said in a statement at the time. “The designations are intended to hold Ansarallah accountable for its terrorist acts, including cross-border attacks threatening civilian populations, infrastructure, and commercial shipping.”Pompeo had said that if the Houthis did not behave like a terrorist organization, they would not be designated as a terrorist organization.The statement added:We need not look further than the callous attack targeting the civilian airport in Aden on December 30, in which the Houthis struck the arrival terminal killing 27 individuals, including three staff members of the International Committee of the Red Cross, to see the destruction the Houthis continue to inflict upon civilians and civilian infrastructure. The Yemeni and Saudi governments as well as multiple experts have directly tied this attack to Ansarallah. …It has led a brutal campaign that has killed many people, continues to destabilize the region, and denies Yemenis a peaceful solution to the conflict in their country. Rather than distance itself from the Iranian regime, it has embraced the world’s leading state-sponsor of terrorism even more. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has supplied Ansarallah with missiles, drones, and training, allowing the group to target airports and other critical infrastructure.Not only did Biden lift the terrorist designation on the Yemeni Houthis, he also announced in 2021 that the U.S. would no longer support Saudi Arabia’s war against the terrorists.The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

ATLANTA — The NCAA Women’s Swimming Championship wrapped up Saturday evening, accentuated by rumblings in the deep over fairness in women’s sports and the inclusion of a biologically male swimmer in female races.University of Pennsylvania swimmer Lia Thomas competed Saturday evening in the 100 freestyle final, finishing in 8th place with a time of 48.18 seconds.The transgender athlete, who won the 500 freestyle on Thursday evening and tied for fifth in the 200 freestyle Friday evening, has drawn nationwide backlash by swimming and competing on a women’s team after racing with men for three years.Tension was palpable in the stands as Thomas was announced the winner of the 500 freestyle  — and when Thomas was introduced ahead of the 200 freestyle.Some in the crowd booed, some clapped, some cheered, some yelled angrily. Activists from “Save Women’s Sports” hung a banner protesting Thomas from the railings in the stands.“I’m not a vet but I know what a dog is.” A clash of views as Lis Thomas races ahead at the NCAA 500 freestyle prelims. pic.twitter.com/X9J5yzmozd— Madeleine Kearns (@madeleinekearns) March 17, 2022When attendees clapped and cheered for Thomas at Saturday morning’s preliminary races, the athlete turned a smiling face up to the crowd and briefly waved.“It means the world to be here … I try to ignore it as much as I can,” Thomas told ESPN after winning the 500 freestyle. “I try to focus on my swimming, what I need to do to get ready for my races. And just try to block out everything else.”Thomas declined to attend the Thursday evening post-race press conference, according to ESPN, where the transgender swimmer would likely have been pressed about backlash to a biological male in women’s sports.Thomas’ presence was noticeable on the pool deck — aside from the fact that Thomas stands taller than many of the swimmers, the athlete also is broad shouldered and clearly has male anatomy.Three-time Olympic gold medalist Rowdy Gaines, now an ESPN analyst broadcasting at the NCAAs, confirmed to The Daily Wire on Friday afternoon that the collegiate swimming world is “overwhelmingly” concerned about fairness in women’s sports.“I’m finding there’s a lot of terms that come up that, terms like the fairness issue and not a level playing field, hopeless, helpless feeling,” he said, adding that some people he has spoken with have articulated that they feel it is “a sad day for the sport.”Multiple parents with whom The Daily Wire spoke confirmed this sentiment, describing anxious mothers, fathers, coaches, and swimmers who fear publicly discussing the subject lest they face societal repercussions in a quick-to-cancel culture.The female athletes themselves were hesitant or unwilling to share how they felt with The Daily Wire. Many of them said they were not supposed to talk to media during the championships.Should the girls themselves speak out? Felipe worries that they might become victims of society's savage cancel culture. ""I understand how the kids are feeling. I understand how the coaches are feeling. This has to come down on the NCAA.” pic.twitter.com/9g7M6aTSxs— Mary Margaret Olohan (@MaryMargOlohan) March 19, 2022“I just don’t think it’s fair,” said the father of a swimmer from Virginia. “These young ladies have worked too hard to be treated like that.”The Virginia dad said that it has been “incredibly obvious” from where he has been sitting in the stands that parents “don’t appear to be supportive of Lia Thomas.”“It happened several times yesterday when he finished, when he touched the wall and finished,” the father explained. “Nobody clapped, really. When the second place person came in, the place exploded.”Felipe Delgado, the father of a sophomore swimmer competing at the championships against Lia Thomas, indicated that the NCAA is to blame for failing to establish proper parameters.“Had they established rules that prohibited [Thomas] from being here, she wouldn’t be here,” Delgado said in a Friday evening interview.“I am a believer that there is a gatekeeper,” he said. “And when that gatekeeper allows somebody to come in who potentially shouldn’t be invited to the party, I think ultimately the brunt of the blame, if there is blame to be had, would fall on that person.”The NCAA has not responded to requests for comment from The Daily Wire.The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

The Starlink terminals that SpaceX founder Elon Musk sent to Ukraine have reportedly given them an advantage in winning the drone war against the invading Russian military.“Aerorozvidka (Aerial Reconnaissance) is being used to attack Russian drones and target Vladmir Putin’s army of tanks and track down their positions in the conflict, which has been ongoing since February 24,” the Daily Mail reported. “Drones used in the field are able to use the newly available Starlink to keep connected and provide intelligence as internet and power outages plague Ukraine. With the technology, the drones can be directed to drop anti-tank munitions to help ward off the Russian attack.”Musk said earlier this month that SpaceX’s Starlink satellite broadband service was now available in Ukraine with more terminals en route to the country, a remark that came in response to a request on Twitter from Mykhailo Fedorov, the Vice Prime Minister of Ukraine, who tweeted: “@elonmusk, while you try to colonize Mars — Russia try to occupy Ukraine! While your rockets successfully land from space — Russian rockets attack Ukrainian civil people! We ask you to provide Ukraine with Starlink stations and to address sane Russians to stand.”“Starlink service is now active in Ukraine,” Musk responded. “More terminals en route.”“Starlink provides high-speed, low-latency broadband internet across the globe. Within each coverage area, orders are fulfilled on a first-come, first-served basis,” the company says. “Using advanced satellites in a low orbit, Starlink enables video calls, online gaming, streaming, and other high data rate activities that historically have not been possible with satellite internet.”“Starlink is ideally suited for areas where connectivity has been unreliable or completely unavailable,” the company added. “People across the globe are using Starlink to gain access to education, health services and even communications support during natural disasters.”Musk later issued a warning that those using SpaceX’s Starlink terminals in Ukraine were at a high risk of being targeted by the Russians because those are some of the only remaining systems on the ground that work.“Important warning: Starlink is the only non-Russian communications system still working in some parts of Ukraine, so probability of being targeted is high,” Musk tweeted. “Please use with caution.”When later asked about how users should use the system with caution, Musk responded, “Turn on Starlink only when needed and place antenna away as far away from people as possible.”Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky later praised Musk in a tweet, writing: “Talked to @elonmusk. I’m grateful to him for supporting Ukraine with words and deeds. Next week we will receive another batch of Starlink systems for destroyed cities. Discussed possible space projects. But I’ll talk about this after the war.”Related:Elon Musk Praised For Coming To Ukraine’s Rescue: ‘Pushes A Button And Changes The Course Of History’Elon Musk Pushes Energy Policy For U.S. That Would ‘Negatively Affect’ His Own Company: ‘Extraordinary Times Demand Extraordinary Measures’Elon Musk Announces Starlink Terminals Sent To Ukraine Won’t Take Certain Actions Unless Forced ‘At Gunpoint’The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, pointed out on Twitter that “Rachel Levine is a man” — and was subsequently flagged for “hateful conduct” by the social media giant.Earlier this week, USA Today chose Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services Rachel Levine — a biological man who claims transgender identity — as one of its “Women of the Year.” According to the outlet, the Biden appointee is among the “strong and resilient women who have been champions of change and courage, often quietly, but with powerful results.”Paxton screenshotted USA Today’s story and tweeted simply that “Rachel Levine is a man.” Twitter flagged the tweet, stating that it “violated the Twitter Rules about hateful conduct.” However, the tweet was not removed because Twitter “determined that it may be in the public’s interest for the Tweet to remain accessible.”Rachel Levine is a man. pic.twitter.com/OWgpKUmfHz— Attorney General Ken Paxton (@KenPaxtonTX) March 17, 2022Paxton later released a statement doubling down on his original message.“Yesterday I stated an irrefutable scientific fact: Rachel Levine is a man,” Paxton wrote. “I pointed this out after USA Today named him a ‘Woman’ of the Year. But Levine is not a woman. He has one X and one Y chromosome and other male-sex characteristics. I just follow the science.”“For simply saying this matter-of-factly, Twitter blocked it as ‘hateful.’ Users can now only access my statement through a trigger-warning filter. And even then, users can neither like it nor comment on it,” he continued. “At the same time, hundreds of other verified accounts saying the exact same thing remain untouched and unfiltered.”“This whole insane episode represents a two-pronged attack from the left — both of which I’m vigorously fighting against. First is the left’s war against human biology, and especially against women. Second is their weaponization of Big Tech against conservative voices,” Paxton added.“But Big Tech is not only anti-conservative and anti-Republican. It is now apparently anti-truth and anti-science. I will continue to use all my power to hold them accountable. Even now, I’m exploring legal options to stop their one-sided censorship.”My statement on Big Tech censorship ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/7lejatKx2K— Attorney General Ken Paxton (@KenPaxtonTX) March 18, 2022Paxton, however, is not the first Republican lawmaker to be censored by Twitter for making note of Levine’s biology. Twitter locked the account of Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN) last year after he said that “the title of first female four-star officer gets taken by a man,” referring to Levine’s nomination as a four-star admiral of the U.S. Public Health Services Commissioned Corps.“Calling someone that was born and lived as a man for 54 years the first ‘female’ four-star officer is an insult to every little girl who dreams of breaking glass ceilings one day,” Banks also tweeted last year.Criticism of USA Today for snubbing women in favor of Levine occurs as Lia Thomas — a biological man on the University of Pennsylvania swim team who likewise claims transgender identity — placed first in the NCAA Women’s Swimming Championship 500 yard freestyle on Thursday. In response, many honored University of Virginia swimmer Emma Weyant, who placed second, as the true winner.The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

The collegiate swimming world is “overwhelmingly” concerned about fairness in women’s sports, three-time Olympic gold medalist Rowdy Gaines said Friday.Gaines discussed controversy surrounding transgender swimmer Lia Thomas and biological men in women’s sports during an interview with The Daily Wire at the NCAA Women’s Swimming Championships in Atlanta, Georgia.The transgender University of Pennsylvania swimmer clocked in at 4:33:24 in the women’s 500 freestyle finals Thursday evening, finishing first ahead of the University of Virginia’s Emma Weyant, a freshman.Thomas will compete in the women’s 200 freestyle Friday evening and the 100 freestyle on Saturday, and is slated to finish second in the 200 freestyle and tenth in the 100 freestyle.“We’re in uncharted territory for sure,” said Gaines, an ESPN swimming analyst. “This is new.”Night one at the @NCAA Women’s Swimming and Diving Championship.

Our coverage starts at 6 on ESPN3. pic.twitter.com/cJSKEAZTok— Bill Spaulding (@BillSpaulding) March 16, 2022The three-time Olympic gold medalist said that he has discussed the present controversy with many members of the swimming world over the past few months — coaches, swimmers, officials, attendees at the NCAA — and many of them are concerned about biological men in women’s sports.“I’m finding there’s a lot of terms that come up that, terms like the fairness issue and not a level playing field, hopeless, helpless feeling,” he said, adding that some people he has spoken with have articulated that they feel it is “a sad day for the sport.”“But at the same time, I think most people don’t want to be distracted by what’s going on,” he continued. “They need to focus on — put the blinders on, so to speak, and kind of focus on their task because they can’t really do anything about what’s going on here. They’re just trying to go day by day and doing what they can do.”“The overwhelming majority” of those whom he has spoken with are talking about fairness, he emphasized, noting, “It’s a fairness issue.”Lia Thomas has “followed every rule and every protocol” set forward by officials, the Olympic swimmer insisted.“You can’t blame Lia Thomas,” he said. “You can blame the decision, but she’s doing what she’s been given a right to do.”“I don’t know who it is that makes those kind of decisions,” he continued. “It’s not an easy decision to make for anybody. None of us have ever experienced anything like this. So I have to give the benefit of the doubt to the decision makers on this as well as anybody else.”It’s unlikely that the female swimmers would weigh in on present controversies during the actual NCAA events, he said, since they are so focused on their upcoming races.“Now you may hear a lot next week,” he predicted. “But this week, you know, everybody’s got their nose to grindstone.”“You have to understand, these kids swim six to 10 miles a day, six days a week,” he said. “Think about running six to 10 months, and you’re swimming six to 10 miles. And they’ve been doing it for eight months now, day in and day out, on top of going to school every day.”“If it was me, total chaos could be going on around me, and I wouldn’t be paying attention to it because I worked too hard to get there,” he said.Gaines pushed back on criticisms of female swimmers who do not speak out against biological males participating in their sports.“It’s not the girls’ fault,” he said. “Their job is to swim here … their job is to perform at the highest level as a college athlete, as a student athlete. When did people tell them it was their job to speak up?”As the father of four daughters and the grandfather to five grandchildren, Gaines said he is “sensitive to this issue” and feels for “both sides.” He described himself as a “dopey” onlooker who comments on sports on TV.“My job is really just to talk about the race and analyze the races,” he said. “But at the same time, you know, I like to get a pulse of what people are feeling.”The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

Fans are attempting to paint Kim Kardashian’s new relationship with “SNL” star Pete Davidson as a saner, calmer existence than what she had with ex-husband Kanye West. “KUWTK” fans find it adorable that this couple goes to the movies on Staten Island and hits In-N-Out for burgers like regular people. However, those same fans were slightly taken aback by Kardashian’s latest admission about her new beau.During a recent appearance on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” the reality star shared a few details about her relationship, which included the confirmation that Davidson had gotten “a few” tattoos of her name which Kardashian described as “so cute.”The “Kim” tattoo fans spotted in photos isn’t actually a tattoo; it’s an even more permanent form of body modification. As Kardashian explained to DeGeneres:“Umm, yeah he has a few tattoos, a few cute ones that he got,” Kim explained. “But this one is a … the ‘Kim’ isn’t a tattoo it’s actually a branding. Like a branding. Because … he wanted to do something that was different. Because the first tattoo he got I was like ‘oh, so cute.’ The second I was like, ‘oh, you know, whatever, so cute.’”Another tattoo the comedian got in honor of Kardashian says, “my girl is a lawyer.” This alludes to the fact that the 44-year-old reality star passed California’s “baby bar” law exam in December 2021. The “KUWTK” alum explained the thoughts behind the branding.“I just think he was like ‘I want something that’s there that I can’t get rid of my tattoos,’” Kardashian continued “Because he’s in the process of getting rid of his arm tats and neck tats. So, he was like ‘I don’t want to be able to get rid of it, cover it up, and I just wanted it there like a scar on me.’”Some fans were not equally charmed by Davidson’s permanent display of affection, especially considering the couple has only been dating for a few months and Kardashian finalized her divorce from West just two weeks ago.“Can we stop romanticizing branding. It is not ‘cute’ that Pete Davidson carved Kim K’s name into his skin … it is concerning,” one follower shared on Twitter.Others pointed out how Davidson tends to get name tattoos of any woman he’s dating, including his ex-fiance Ariana Grande.“I love Pete but like… this gave me the ick. Like you didn’t learn from the ariana tattoos?????” another fan wondered. Unlike with tattoos, the branding can’t be removed with laser treatments.“I remember thinking it was a 🚩 when Pete got Ariana’s bunny ears tattooed on his neck. Branding Kim’s name on his chest is next level 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩!!!” another Twitter user agreed.“Pete Davidson branded Kim’s name on his chest (a woman who he just started dating a few months ago) but claims he wants to ‘help’ Kanye with his mental health. No comment,” another said.Many fans were expecting Kardashian’s hookup with Davidson to become a short-lived, post-marriage fling and nothing more. However, as time goes by it seems their relationship is getting more serious by the day. The branding and tattoos are just the latest examples of Kardashian and Davidson proving that point.Enter for the chance to hang out with Gina Carano at the premiere of her new Daily Wire movie, Terror on the Prairie!

The New York Times on Wednesday finally admitted that the 2020 New York Post story regarding information found on Hunter Biden’s laptop was legitimate.The Times confirmed the existence of Biden’s laptop in a story about a federal investigation into the son of President Joe Biden.“People familiar with the investigation said prosecutors had examined emails between Mr. Biden, Mr. [Devon] Archer and others about Burisma and other foreign business activity. Those emails were obtained by The New York Times from a cache of files that appears to have come from a laptop abandoned by Mr. Biden in a Delaware repair shop. The email and others in the cache were authenticated by people familiar with them and with the investigation,” the Times reported.The information contained on the laptop, first published by the Post in the month before the 2020 election, was undermined by numerous news outlets and social media companies, who tried to suggest it wasn’t real. The Daily Wire previously reported on these attempts by Politico, NPR, The Washington Post, and others.The Times itself had previously sought to undermine the story with an article titled “New York Post Published Hunter Biden Report Amid Newsroom Doubts,” which emphasized that “The New York Post’s front-page article about Hunter Biden on Wednesday was written mostly by a staff reporter who refused to put his name on it, two Post employees said.”The Times further claimed that “Many Post staff members questioned whether the paper had done enough to verify the authenticity of the hard drive’s contents, said five people with knowledge of the tabloid’s inner workings. Staff members also had concerns about the reliability of its sources and its timing, the people said.”But while much of the focus has been on media outlets who attempted to undermine a story that could cause political damage to a favored candidate, one must remember that 50 members of the Intelligence Community released a public statement – published by Politico – that attempted to cast doubt on the laptop story as a “Russian information operation.”Those who signed the letter included a statement – five paragraphs in – stating that “We want to emphasize that we do not know if the emails, provided to the New York Post by President Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, are genuine or not and that we do not have evidence of Russian involvement — just that our experience makes us deeply suspicious that the Russian government played a significant role in this case.”Every other word of the statement was written to undermine the credibility of the emails and suggest that Russia was behind the information. Signers of the letter include numerous Obama appointees who went on to become mainstream media commentators, including former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former CIA director John Brennan. Other signers included former Director of National Intelligence Michael Hayden and former CIA director Leon Panetta.Richard Grenell, former acting Director of National Intelligence under President Donald Trump, tweeted on Thursday that a “Republican Senate MUST hold hearings with all 50 of the people who signed that letter 3 weeks before the 2020 campaign.

ATLANTA — Felipe Delgado is one of the only parents willing to go on the record and share how he feels about a biological male competing against his daughter.“I just feel that somebody has got to come out and say something,” he said in a Friday evening interview with The Daily Wire, “but we cannot do this argument with hate. We have to do it in a conversational tone, welcoming dialogue, because that’s the only way things are really going to get resolved.”“It’s going to be too late once you have to pull back,” he warned. “Once you have to take back awards that have been won. Once you have to erase records that have been had. That’s when the pain is really going to settle in for certain people.”NEW: @realDailyWire spoke with @fdelgado101, whose daughter who will be swimming against Lia Thomas in the 100 freestyle today. Delgado explains why he takes issue with his daughter swimming against a biological male – and why he thinks the NCAA is promoting division. pic.twitter.com/7m90LKm5PJ— Mary Margaret Olohan (@MaryMargOlohan) March 19, 2022Delgado sat down with The Daily Wire at the NCAA Women’s Swimming and Diving Championships in Atlanta, Georgia, ahead of his daughter’s Saturday 100 freestyle competition.Anicka Delgado, a sophomore at the University of Southern California, is currently slated to clock in at 48.56 seconds in the 100 freestyle, 48th out of 65 athletes competing in the event.Heat sheets show that athlete Lia Thomas, a biological man who identifies as a transgender woman, is slated to clock in at 47.63 seconds — 10th in the race, and the only biological male out of the slew of female racers.Preliminary races took place Saturday morning and determine who swims in the finals Saturday night: Thomas, who placed fourth with a time of 47:37, will swim this evening, while Delgado, who placed 33 with a time of 48:57, will not.Felipe tells me that facing a biological male is not only hard for his daughter, ""it's hard for a lot of the kids"" at the NCAA. ""These kids should be focusing on nothing more than a swim meet they have been preparing for for the last 6 months,"" he says. pic.twitter.com/4fC7jeizFO— Mary Margaret Olohan (@MaryMargOlohan) March 19, 2022Thomas finished first in the women’s 500 freestyle Thursday evening. On Friday, multiple female swimmers finished ahead of Thomas in the 200 freestyle.Delgado’s father made it clear that he believes it is unfair for Thomas to be racing in his daughter’s race, but he emphasized the importance of engaging in dignified and respectful dialogue in order to effect change.“You have to remember, Lia Thomas is a human being,” he said. “You have to see the human side.”Thomas is not the gatekeeper, he noted, pointing out that the transgender swimmer is “playing within” the NCAA’s rules.“Had they established rules that prohibited her from being here, she wouldn’t be here,” Delgado said.More of the responsibility for the current divisive climate should be put on the NCAA, he said, emphasizing that “we should be focusing on the positive, all of the fantastic accomplishments that are taking place here this this week.”“I am a believer that there is a gatekeeper,” he said. “And when that gatekeeper allows somebody to come in who potentially shouldn’t be invited to the party, I think ultimately the brunt of the blame, if there is blame to be had, would fall on that person.”I asked Felipe why so few parents are willing to speak up about Lia Thomas/fairness in women's sports. He's not sure, but he's been hearing from upset parents ""all weekend long.""""The majority of the people at this swim meet do not think what is going on is right."" pic.twitter.com/kX7EhwbrNZ— Mary Margaret Olohan (@MaryMargOlohan) March 19, 2022Parents, swimmers, and attendees at the NCAA have been abuzz with concerns about the transgender swimmer and fairness in women’s sports, multiple sources told The Daily Wire.But few of these parents have voiced their concerns publicly, and the most high profile dissent appears to have come from conservative activists and commentators online.Delgado initially signaled his feelings in a Wednesday tweet that said: “My daughter will be racing Lia Thomas this weekend in the 100 free at the women’s @NCAA. I’ll be rooting for my daughter.”“Fight on,” he added in a hashtag.“Fault those that out of fear of being cancelled or labeled transphobic, [were] not willing to do the right thing and admit that they were wrong,” he tweeted later. “That much more has to go into this before people like Lia can complete fairly.”“What happens when this reaches the international scene & sporting events like the Olympic Games come into play?” he asked. “Then what?”The current controversy over Thomas is not the transgender swimmer’s fault, Delgado tweeted.“Standing up for the integrity of women’s sports does not make one transphobic,” he added. “I just wish those that have power know that.”My daughter will be racing Lia Thomas this weekend in the 100 free at women’s @NCAA . I’ll be rooting for my daughter. #fighton pic.twitter.com/vkeN4BzhWA— Felipe Delgado (@fdelgado101) March 16, 2022“Right now,  I can tell you, the majority of people certainly do not think it’s right,” the swimmer’s father told The Daily Wire. “So we need to sit back and look and see, did we act too quickly? Do we need to step back? Maybe change things around?”Parents have told him “all weekend long” that they are unhappy about Thomas racing with the girls.“I don’t think there would be so much discord if people weren’t as passionate as they are about this,” he said. “I have three daughters myself, so I do have a dog in this fight. Women’s sports have come so far just to be thrown right back into question, and that’s what needs to be changed.”The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

For the past several weeks, there has been renewed hope that New York City would lift its private sector COVID-19 vaccine mandate following the end of the city’s vaccine mandate pertaining to indoor dining and entertainment on March 7.The private sector mandate is having a large impact on the sports world, as Brooklyn Nets point guard Kyrie Irving is unable to play in games taking place in New York City, including in his home arena of Barclays Center.Those hopes were dampened on Friday.According to ABC7 New York, New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan said the private sector mandate will remain in place indefinitely.“I think it’s indefinite at this point,” Vasan said. “People who have tried to predict what’s going to happen in the future for this pandemic have repeatedly found egg on their face, as they say. And I’m not going to do that here today.”“I would love for me to sit here and say, I can give you a date or a data point for when we would lift those things,” he continued. “Right now, we are in a low risk environment, and we will continue to evaluate that data.”The impact of the mandate has been on full display over the past week.On Sunday, Irving attended Brooklyn’s game versus the New York Knicks at Barclays Center as a fan, as he was still unable to compete as a member of the Nets in the city of New York. Unvaccinated visiting team players are allowed to play in NYC according to the mandate.The vaccine mandate may also have a major impact on New York’s two Major League Baseball teams, the New York Mets and the New York Yankees.According to a report from The New York Times, playing at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx and Citi Field in Queens will not be a possibility for unvaccinated members of the Yankees and the Mets.On Tuesday, Yankees slugger Aaron Judge was asked about his vaccination status, and his answer provided more questions.“I’m still focused on getting to the first game of Spring Training,” Judge said at a press conference. “So, I think we’ll cross that bridge whenever the time comes, But right now, so many things could change. So, I’m not really too worried about that right now.”On Sunday, Yankees manager Aaron Boone confirmed that his roster contains a “few guys” who aren’t vaccinated, meaning those who have refused the COVID-19 vaccine also will not be allowed to travel to Toronto to play the Blue Jays. The Yankees have nine scheduled games in Toronto during the 2022-2023 season and 81 regular season games in New York.Opening Day of MLB’s regular season is April 7, when both the Yankees and the Mets will kick off the year.Joe Morgan is the Sports Reporter for The Daily Wire.

ATLANTA, GA. — The father of a swimmer competing at the NCAA Women’s Swimming Championship described watching transgender athlete Lia Thomas dominating female swimmers as “unfair” and “soul crushing.”The transgender University of Pennsylvania swimmer clocked in at 4:33:24 in the women’s 500 freestyle finals Thursday evening, finishing first ahead of the University of Virginia’s Emma Weyant, a freshman.Thomas will compete in the women’s 200 freestyle Friday evening and the 100 freestyle on Saturday. The transgender swimmer is slated to finish second in the 200 freestyle and tenth in the 100 freestyle.“I just don’t think it’s fair,” said the father of a swimmer from Virginia who asked not to be identified in order to preserve his daughter’s anonymity. “These young ladies have worked too hard to be treated like that.”The dad expressed concerns in an interview with The Daily Wire that weighing in publicly on controversy over Thomas would embroil his daughter in criticism that might endanger her future job prospects.While some onlookers cheered as the transgender athlete was announced the winner on Thursday evening, the stands also resonated with a chorus of boos and yells.The Virginia dad said that it has been “incredibly obvious” from where he has been sitting in the stands that parents “don’t appear to be supportive of Lia Thomas.”“It happened several times yesterday when he finished, when he touched the wall and finished,” the father explained. “Nobody clapped, really. When the second place person came in, the place exploded.”“You saw the same thing on the podium,” he added. “You know, everybody cheered loudly for the second place finisher, the girl. And not very many people clapped for the champion.”The transgender swimmer’s presence is noticeable on the pool deck — aside from the fact that Thomas stands taller than many of the swimmers, the athlete also clearly has male anatomy.“Soul crushing would be not an understatement,” said the father, asked how it felt to watch Thomas win over a pool of biological women.“I can look at swimmers and tell whether they’re really good,” he said, noting that he doesn’t believe Thomas is exerting as much effort as the female swimmers are.  “And I don’t think that [Thomas] is having to put out as much as the girls are put out to compete as well.”“They’re going out there doing it all and and they’re leaving it all in the pool as it were,” the father continued. “And I just don’t see that that he’s having to do the same thing.”One consistent criticism of transgender athletes in women’s spaces has been that biological males should not be present or be changing in women’s locker rooms.The Virginia dad said he doesn’t know anything firsthand about Thomas and locker rooms, but emphasized that he believes “males should be in a male locker room and biological females should be in a female locker room.”“I’m not comfortable with my daughter being in a locker room with male,” he said. “I think that’s wrong and disgusting.”He described the years of dedication and time that his daughter, who will compete against Thomas during the NCAA championship, has put into becoming a swimmer worthy of such a championship.“I drove nine hours to clap for my daughter for a little under 22 seconds,” he chuckled.Asked if he thinks the work was worth it: “Absolutely. Every bit of it. She’s an amazing young lady, and I’m excited for her future.”The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams made a surprise appearance on the last episode of “Star Trek: Discovery” season 4, IndieWire reported. She appeared in the episode as the president of Earth.The former state representative is an avid “Star Trek” fan, but even so, viewers were surprised to see her acting in the sci-fi series. “I’m still floored when I think about Stacey gracing us with her presence in our Season 4 finale,” actress Sonequa Martin-Green said breathlessly to Deadline. “We spent so much of our time fanning out and pretending to be cool in her midst.”Martin-Green plays Discovery captain Michael Burnham, the first black woman captain. She went on to call Abrams “a legend in the making and a civil hero, and she was an absolute delight to work with.”“She wowed us with her charm, humility, and generosity, and she whipped out some acting chops too!” Martin-Green continued. “It was an honor for me as a Black woman to stand with her in the story. It’s an experience I’ll cherish for the rest of my life.”“Today, we greet the president of United earth”Trekkie Stacey Abrams makes a Star Trek cameo.  pic.twitter.com/Nff8RZt2as— Alex Thompson (@AlexThomp) March 17, 2022Showrunner Michelle Paradise told IndieWire how she’s still in disbelief that Abrams was on the show. “Honestly, the number of times I’ve seen the episode, every time I see her face, I’m like, ‘Wow, that really happened. That’s awesome.’”The casting process started as a hypothetical. “And as we got into season four and got halfway through breaking it, we realized: We need a person to represent Earth. And then the question became: who should that person be? I don’t remember where the idea came from, honestly. But I texted Alex to say, ‘What do you think of Stacey Abrams?’ Immediately, [he sent] exclamation points,” Paradise told the publication. “And he said, ‘Let’s set up a meeting. Let’s talk to her. Let’s see.’ So we did. And she was so kind. And we got on Zoom with her, and we pitched her where we were for the season and who this character was and what this character would represent. And asked if she would be a part of this with us. Honestly, I can’t think of anyone better to represent the president of Earth in all of that.”Paradise revealed that Abrams helped develop the character, too.“When she saw the script and we started talking about costumes and stuff like that, it was just really wanting her input on those things,” the showrunner said. “It’s a character that she needs to embody. She’s so collaborative and was really just wonderful about all of it. It really was just such a treat to have her there and get to have her in Toronto on set.”Abrams is a SAG-AFTRA cardholder. Her previous acting credits include voicing herself on the two-episode election themed animated “Black-ish” in October 2020.As for whether Abrams will have another “Star Trek” cameo, Paradise said she’s more than open to it.“Oh my gosh, I would love that,” Paradise said. “I mean, I have no idea. She’s certainly busy doing other things.” Abrams is running for governor in Georgia in 2022 after a failed bid in 2018. The Atlanta resident famously refused to concede to her opponent, Gov. Brian Kemp, because she believed voter suppression skewed the election results. Abrams has since launched Fair Fight, a group created to “put in place the guardrails that ensure every American has an equal opportunity to make their voice heard and be fairly represented.”Enter for the chance to hang out with Gina Carano at the premiere of her new Daily Wire movie, Terror on the Prairie!

Someone Reported Him To The School Bias Team.By  Ashe Schow•Mar 18, 2022   DailyWire.com•FacebookTwitterMailUpperCut Images/Getty Images
A professor at the State University of New York (SUNY)-Cortland was reported after he told his class that race and gender relations had improved since the 1930s.The professor, whose name has not been reported, had apparently began his first class of the semester by saying he was not “one of those America-is-evil academics,” according to a student who filed a complaint against the professor afterward.The professor also allegedly said that younger generations need to understand that America has made progress since the 1930s, and that “we should be proud of how far we’ve come as a society relating to race and gender relations.” The professor apparently went on to say that when he was growing up, “women only aspired to mediocrity,” but that was not the case anymore and that things are better now.A student taking the class took offense and reported the professor to SUNY-Cortland’s Bias Response Team, an avenue for students and staff to report each other over perceived insults. This particular complaint was uncovered by The College Fix, who received the documentation from a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. The names of those who were reported, and the complainants were redacted from the documents provided to the Fix.The student who filed the complaint claimed that “This seemed incredibly tone-deaf, and completely unnecessary and unrelated to our syllabus.”“It made me sick to my stomach because it was clear that people had tried to educate him, and he was firmly within his beliefs and ignorance,” the student added.The Fix reported that the student also claimed “the professor had said that many people today blame outside sources such as discrimination for their problems instead of taking accountability for themselves.”The report against the professor was not the only one discovered by the FOIA request. The Fix discovered about three dozen complaints in total that had been filed since January 2020 (just before the pandemic shut down many colleges in the U.S.), the outlet noted:Other complaints included a professor who used the terms “redsk*n” and “Squ*w” when discussing Peter Pan, a student who yelled “shut up, I’m trying to sleep” at Black Lives Matter protesters, and a dorm resident who called her roommate a “Dyke-A-Saurus Rex.”Many cases involved professors getting reported for what they said in class, the Fix reported, including the Peter Pan incident.“While talking about Peter Pan, for class, because he is the professor, he really did say both ‘redsk*n’ and ‘Squ*w’ out loud,” the student complaint said. “While he was referencing the fact that the depiction of native people in that novel was stereotypical and offensive, he also literally said those out loud. They’re slurs used against indigenous people, he didn’t have to actually say them in order to explain the problematic depiction in the novel?”SUNY-Cortland’s website explains that the bias reporting form allows students and faculty to report each other for perceived slights involving “(dis)ability, age, ethnicity, gender/sexism, gender identity/expression, nationality/immigration status, physical appearance, race, faith/non-faith, sexual orientation, and/or socio-economic status/class.”“We at SUNY Cortland are committed to mitigating behavior and conditions that work against the richness of a diverse and inclusive community,” the website says. “Biased related incidents on the SUNY Cortland campus are of great concern for all members of the campus community. A biased related incident not only impacts people at an individual level, it negatively impacts our entire community.”The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

“The Boys” actress Karen Fukuhara made a statement against anti-Asian violence while telling her fans about what she suggested was a personal and racially motivated attack. The 30-year-old California native recalled a situation in which, she says, a random person struck her in the head then just kept walking. “Today I was struck in the head by a man,” she wrote on the Instagram post, assuring followers that she was “physically fine” following the incident. “This s*** needs to stop. Us women, Asians and the elderly need your help.”She included the hashtag “Stop Asian Hate” with the post, proving she believed the attack to be related to her being Asian. The “Suicide Squad” alum did not elaborate on where the incident took place. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Karen Fukuhara (@karenfukuhara)“I rarely share about my private life but something happened today that I thought was important,” Fukuhara wrote. “I was walking to a cafe for some coffee and a man struck me in the back of my head. It came out of nowhere. We made no eye contact before, I wasn’t doing anything out of the ordinary. It came to my surprise and my hat flew off. By the time I looked back, he was a few feet away from me (he must have kept walking after hitting me).”Fukuhara explained how she thought about “confronting” her attacker but realized it “wasn’t worth the risk.” She recalled, “After a few seconds of staring at each other, and him yelling at me, he eventually walked away.”“I write this, because I’ve had conversations with multi-racial friends of mine that had no idea these hate crimes happen to everyday, regular people — people that they share meals with,” she went on. “I felt it was important to raise awareness.”The Los Angeles native revealed that this incident has led her to think about taking self-defense classes after the “shock” of the attack. She also expressed relief that her attacker didn’t have a weapon on him.“Why is this something we as ‘victims’ have to think about?” Fukuhara wondered. “What satisfaction are these perpetrators getting from hitting women, Asians, the elderly? They need to be held accountable. What can we do as a community to prevent these horrible crimes?”The comments on the Instagram post were flooded with support from fans, including some of the star’s co-stars from “The Boys.” “F this person!! Hope you’re ok this is awful,” actor Chace Crawford wrote.“Karen thank you for sharing your experience,” Jack Quaid said. “I’m sorry that happened to you. Love you.

A young woman who competed against a biologically male track runner in college weighed in on controversy over transgender swimmer Lia Thomas, saying that allowing males in female competitions is a “disservice” to “all women in sports.”Linnea Saltz won the 800 meter track race in the Big Sky Conference Outdoor Championship in 2019. As she headed into her senior year of college, she was informed that a biologically male athlete who formerly ran on the University of Montana men’s track team, had taken a red shirt year — and that athlete would now be competing against her as a woman.The former track athlete joined protestors from the “Save Women’s Sports” organization outside the NCAA Division I Championship meet in Atlanta, Georgia on Thursday as transgender swimmer Lia Thomas, a biological male, crushed female competitors in the 500 freestyle.Saltz, who was hoping to win the Big Sky Conference Outdoor Championship and potentially pursue an All-American track title, told The Daily Wire that she was incredibly discouraged to be told by her coaches that she would have to face a biological male, who goes by the name June Eastwood.“I just thought to myself, ‘Well, I’m so excited to go and defend my title again, but am I not going to have that opportunity anymore? Because now a man who has competed and run ten seconds faster than me in the eight hundred, I’m now going to have to defend my title against somebody that already possesses this physiological biological advantage over me?'”“It was just really disappointing, and it was hard for me to understand why the NCAA would allow something like that to happen,” she said.Saltz said that she believes many of the people on her team and within the conference felt that they were not being heard and they did not have an opportunity to race on a level playing field.“That’s why I come out to things like this is because I don’t want women to feel the way that I did,” she said, gesturing around her at small groups of protestors outside the NCAA women’s championships. “I don’t want women to feel the way that my teammates did. It’s a disservice honestly to all women in sports.”Saltz told The Daily Wire that she observed a swimmer crying on Thursday.Virginia Tech swimmer competing in this year’s NCAA championship details how her teammate was brought to tears after her place in the finals was taken by Lia Thomas: pic.twitter.com/mow56mVp1W— Sav (@RapidFire_Pod) March 17, 2022“One of our women over here was like, ‘Why don’t you speak out about it,'” Saltz said. “And they said, ‘Well, I’m scared. I can’t be walking around wearing my university’s brand and talking about this.'”Saltz said she pulled aside the girls and told them, “Well, I did.”“I used to compete at Southern Utah University,” the former track athlete said that she told the students. “I went and spoke with my president. I spoke with the athletic director I spoke with as EU counsel, and I told them, ‘Listen, whether you believe me or not, or whether you agree with my opinion or not, I’m going forward with this. Then I’m going towards the NCAA and I don’t know if you’re going to be on my side or not, but I just want you to know what I’m doing.'”Saltz said that she was fully supported by her university, emphasizing that she felt lucky to be at a university that was completely on her side.“I know that I may not be an athlete now, but I did come out and advocate for this issue then, and people are just as hateful to me now as they were back then,” she said she told the swimmers. “It’s never going to be different. And so I may be receiving a lot of hate…I’ve had athletes that I’ve competed against a multitude of times, say really hateful, hurtful things towards me because of my opinions.”Critics of those who support women’s sports often insist they would never tear down other women, Saltz said.“But that’s exactly what they’re doing to me when I’m trying to speak on behalf of women athletes,” she added.Saltz raced her transgender competitor at the Big Sky indoor conference championship in February 2020, right before the coronavirus pandemic began. The athlete did not race Saltz in the 800-meter competition, which Saltz won.But as Saltz and her teammates competed against the transgender athlete in a relay race, she overheard the University of Montana coach telling Eastwood to slow down.“That was the sticking point for me,” she said. “And that honestly made me and all of my advocacy efforts feel worth it because it just was so clear to me that my coach would never tell me to slow down.”“No coach would tell you to slow down,” she added, suggesting that the University of Montana coach told the transgender athlete to slow down in order to not crush competitors by too much. “The whole point of track and field is you completely exhaust yourself on the track we call emptying the tank. We want everything to be depleted by the time you cross the finish line. So you would never tell your athlete to slow down. You would tell them to push it to their ultimate limits.”The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

One Virginia Tech swimmer spoke out publicly this week after a teammate was crushed by the “inclusion” of biologically male transgender swimmer Lia Thomas, who handily took first place in the NCAA Women’s Swimming Championship 500 yard freestyle on Thursday.“It’s a common conception that we are all very disappointed and frustrated with someone who has capabilities more than us women have,” the swimmer told Rapid Fire’s Savanah Hernandez, according to Outkick. “To be able to compete at this level and take opportunities away from other women.”The female competitor was wearing a sticker that reads, “Say no to males competing as females.”“I’ve got a teammate who did not make the final today because she was just bumped out of finals,” the collegiate swimmer revealed. “It’s heartbreaking to see someone who went through puberty as a male and has the body of a male be able to absolutely blow away the competition.”“You go into it with the mindset that you don’t have a chance,” she continued. “It’s hard to compete against someone with the aerobic capacity, the muscle development, the body of a man. It’s hard; it’s hard to think about it like that. … It’s disappointing to see and frustrating.”One of her teammates was brought to tears after she came in 17th place, missing the finals by one place, because of Thomas’ “inclusion.”“She was very emotional, and it’s hard to see because it’s her last NCAAs; she really loves that race, and it was just heartbreaking that she put all of her efforts into it today … one of the best times that’s she went in a morning session and still not make it back,” the swimmer described. “It’s hard to see someone who works every day and every night still not be able to compete against someone like that.”WATCH:Virginia Tech swimmer competing in this year’s NCAA championship details how her teammate was brought to tears after her place in the finals was taken by Lia Thomas: pic.twitter.com/mow56mVp1W— Sav (@RapidFire_Pod) March 17, 2022Following the win, Thomas spoke to a reporter from ESPN, discussing the “spotlight” the swimmer is under, The Daily Wire reported:“Lia, how did that performance measure up to your expectations coming into this meet tonight?” the reported asked Thomas.“I didn’t have a whole lot of expectations for this meet, I was just happy to be here, trying to race and compete as best as I could,” Thomas answered.“You’ve undoubtedly been under the spotlight over the past few months, how have you been dealing with that, and reasoning with everything?” the reporter followed up.“I try to ignore it as much as a I can,” Thomas said, “I try to focus on my swimming, what I need to do to get ready for my races, and just try to block out everything else.”“What did that race mean to you?” the reporter asked.“It means the world to be here, be with my two best friends and teammates, and be able to compete,” Thomas ended the interview.Related: ‘This Was A South Park Episode’: Social Media Erupts After Lia Thomas Crushes Female Competitors At NCAA TourneyRelated: WATCH: Lia Thomas Does Interview With ESPN After Crushing Biological Women In NCAA ChampionshipsRelated: Mom Speaks Out In Explosive Video Over Trans Swimmer Lia Thomas: ‘A Full-Grown Male’ ‘Taking’ From WomenThe Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

They Didn’t Tell District’s Parents: ReportBy  Hank Berrien•Mar 18, 2022   DailyWire.com•FacebookTwitterMailVladimirFLoyd/GettyImages
According to a new report, the Alexandria, Virginia, school district and school board did not inform parents in the school district regarding a reported violent sexual assault that left the victim in the hospital.“Alexandria police have now directly confirmed to Independent Women’s Forum via email that the police arrested a 14-year-old suspect in early December for ‘aggravated sexua[l] battery, rape, and forcible sodomy’ in connection with the October incident at Minnie Howard campus,” Inez Stepman of National Review reported on Friday, adding that a series of emails were sent vis-à-vis the incident between school-board members, the superintendent, the mayor, and Alexandria police. “Parents, however, were largely left in the dark,” National Review noted.Molly Kaiman, an Alexandria City Public Schools parent, who said she felt “misled, angry, [and] scared,” charged, “Parents had zero communication regarding this incident. This crime should scare parents. If parents knew what had happened, parents could have necessary talks with their children and pressure the school to increase safety.”The only public notification of the reported assault came at a joint board-council hearing, at which it was mentioned that “a potential sexual assault … is being investigated.”“On October 6, 2021, ACPS superintendent Gregory Hutchings sent an email to the nine-member ACPS school board with the subject ‘Potential Sexual Assault,’” National Review reported. “The body of the email contained few details but did say … ‘FYI there is a potential sexual assault of a student by other students this afternoon at MH. The student has been taken to the hospital and APD is working through the investigation. No more details at this time.’”Mayor Justin Wilson and all city councilors were reportedly notified. But days later a parent emailed Hutchings, then-acting Alexandria City police chief Don Hayes, and the mayor to confirm the reported sexual assault and other alleged violent incidents in the school district.The district and school-board officials reportedly did not respond, but Hayes confirmed that a sexual assault at the school was under investigation.Stepman wrote, “The behavior of ACPS and the city council goes far beyond the city of Alexandria. The secrecy surrounding serious crimes at Virginia schools risks becoming systematized. … In November 2021, a bill was introduced to reverse the earlier law and to require reporting of serious misdemeanor crimes. Additionally, the new law requires that parents be notified of such crimes in their children’s schools and be informed of their rights to press charges through the justice system. That bill has passed both houses of the Virginia legislature and is awaiting signature from the governor.”This is not the first episode in Virginia where a reported sexual assault has created headlines; last October, The Daily Wire’s investigative reporter Luke Rosiak broke the story that the Loudoun County school board had lied about a rape in a girls’ bathroom by a boy wearing a skirt, a story that affected the gubernatorial election.The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

The attorney representing the mother of Hunter Biden’s 3-year-old daughter said this week that he expects Hunter Biden, son of Democrat President Joe Biden, to be indicted for tax fraud.The mother, Lunden Alexis Roberts, testified to a federal grand jury in Delaware this week in a criminal investigation into Hunter Biden, according to her attorney, Clint Lancaster. The New York Post noted that Roberts, a former stripper, “was once on Hunter Biden’s payroll at his consulting firm.”Lancaster said that he had already turned over “a significant amount of Hunter’s financial records” to federal law enforcement officials.“I expect him to be indicted,” Lancaster told CNBC. “Just based on what I saw in his financial records, I would be surprised if he’s not indicted.”Lancaster said that he turned over the financial records as part of the case for an Arkansas child support lawsuit filed against Hunter Biden.He said that he witnessed “a lot of information” that was “problematic” for Hunter Biden, although he declined to state what he saw.The New York Times reported this week that the criminal investigation into Hunter Biden also involved his lobbying work in countries around the world:Mr. Biden’s extensive work with foreign businesses came under scrutiny from prosecutors looking into whether he should have registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent. Investigators have examined Mr. Biden’s relationships with interests in Kazakhstan, a Chinese energy conglomerate and Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company, according to people familiar with the investigation.They said prosecutors had investigated payments and gifts Mr. Biden or his associates had received from foreign interests, including a vehicle paid for using funds from a company associated with a Kazakh oligarch and a diamond from a Chinese energy tycoon. Prosecutors also sought documents related to corporate entities through which Mr. Biden and his associates conducted business with interests around the world.Regarding the child support case in Arkansas, Hunter Biden had previously tried to claim that he did not father a child with Roberts, which came as he was living with the widow of his deceased brother. However, a DNA test reportedly showed that Hunter Biden was, in fact, the father.“DNA testing has established, ‘with scientific certainty,’ that Hunter Biden is the father of an Arkansas baby, according to a motion filed Wednesday in Independence County on behalf of the child’s mother, Lunden Alexis Roberts,” The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported. “Hunter Biden, who initially denied having sexual relations with Roberts, eventually agreed to take a DNA test, according to documents filed by Roberts’ attorney, Clint Lancaster.”When asked if Hunter Biden had ever seen his 3-year-old daughter, Lancaster said, “No, he has not.”Related:Russia Takes Action Against Hunter Biden, 12 Other AmericansRepublicans Introduce ‘HUNTER Act’ To Ban Federal Government From Buying Crack PipesHunter Biden’s Ex-Wife Releasing New Book Revealing Dirt On The President’s SonThe Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

A group of A-list celebrities recently signed a letter to City National’s parent company, the Royal Bank of Canada, demanding that they defund the Canada Gas pipeline. According to Fox News, the open letter pleads with the Royal Bank of Canada to “withdraw support from the Coastal GasLink pipeline, effective immediately” because they are “bankrolling the climate crisis and violating the rights of Indigenous Peoples.”The signatures include more than 65 famous names. Mark Ruffalo, Leonardo DiCaprio, Ben Stiller, Scarlett Johansson, Taika Waititi, Jane Fonda, Susan Sarandon, and Robert Downey Jr., Josh Gad, Mariska Hargitay, Rooney Mara, Julianne Moore, Joaquin Phoenix, Amy Schumer, and Marisa Tomei are among those asking for the bank to withdraw financial support.When asked why celebrities were speaking on this, Ruffalo said it was because they have a platform and “people listen to us,” according to Canadian news site Global News.He continued, “We have this privilege and we have to use it for the right thing. None of this matters if our children can’t drink the water, they can’t breathe the air, they can’t go outside, the world burns around them. None of this means anything anymore. We’re becoming desensitized to this insanity that we’re living in.”The actor is known for taking stances on climate change issues specifically. “We have a responsibility to each other,” Ruffalo explained during a press conference Wednesday. “And it’s time for good people and privileged people, like us, to do the right thing. To make other people, good people, uncomfortable. That’s the only way we’re going to break through this system of racism and harm.”Several of those celebrities headed to social media, urging their fans to join in the fight against the pipeline. They used the hashtag #NoMoreDirtyBanks with their posts.Ruffalo posted a video to YouTube explaining his stance. “Right now, major banks like the Royal Bank of Canada are financing a fracked gas pipeline bulldozing through the land of the Wet’suwet’en nation in Northern British Columbia, Canada,” the activist actor said. “The Wet’suwet’en hereditary chiefs never consented to this pipeline construction through their terrorities, which would risk the sacred headwaters of the Wedzin Kwa River, but here’s where it gets complicated.”Ruffalo continued, “The Supreme Court of Canada recognized Wet’suwet’en hereditary chiefs as rightful title holders of the land, but corporations still get away with consulting only ‘elected leadership’ put in place by the colonial government.”Thank you to everyone who signed this. The time to defund @CoastalGasLink is now. @RBC must withdraw from the Coastal GasLink fracked gas pipeline now and stop financing fossil fuels. @CityNational Bank must protect its clients and honor their values. https://t.co/JVrCia9bhH— Mark Ruffalo (@MarkRuffalo) March 17, 2022He also shared on Twitter his thanks for other Hollywood names who signed the letter with him. “Thank you to everyone who signed this.

Here’s Why It Doesn’t Work. | The Daily WireThe Daily WireMenuCloseReadListenWatchDiscussShopSearchLoginJoin— News and Analysis —AOC Links ‘Fossil Fuel Extraction’ To The Murder Of Indigenous Women. Here’s Why It Doesn’t Work.By  Ben Johnson•Mar 18, 2022   DailyWire.com•FacebookTwitterMailScott Eisen / Getty Images
During a congressional hearing, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) attempted to tie “fossil fuel extraction” to the kidnapping, rape, and murder of American Indian women. She intimated that local police officers helped facilitate this violence by protecting the safety of pipeline workers from violent environmentalist activists. And she seemed to blame the Keystone XL pipeline for crimes that took place in areas where it had not been built.AOC, who blames fossil fuels for climate change and has asked bank executives if they should be held responsible for climate change because of their services to the energy industry, said she found a “very meaningful connection” between “fossil fuel extraction sites and abductions and murders of indigenous women.”Ocasio-Cortez said “ruthless” oil companies encourage violence, and she accused unnamed state legislatures of “authorizing and almost legalizing the use of violence against fossil fuel protesters.” In fact, environmentalist protesters have frequently threatened — or perpetrated —  violence against oil and gas industry workers, especially at pipeline worksites. For instance:A team of 20 environmentalist extremists attacked a pipeline worksite with axes and shot flare guns at workers in British Columbia. They felled trees across roadways and threw torches at the Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers who responded. A policeman called the February 17 assault on the Coastal Gaslink pipeline “a calculated and organized violent attack that left its victims shaken and a multimillion dollar path of destruction.” No arrests were made;In September 2016, a group of protesters attacked pipeline workers near the Standing Rock reservation, injuring four security officers and two dogs; andOne protester against the Dakota Access Pipeline shot at police three times with a .38 caliber pistol. Other demonstrators threatened cops with Molotov cocktails and hurled feces at them. Security guards also say the Green activists attacked them, flashing a handgun and a knife.Ocasio-Cortez seemed outraged that local police officers would “protect their extraction sites” from such protests, “even when workers are raping and killing indigenous women.”AOC seemed to say that proposing a pipeline caused murders to increase. The congresswoman reported that 10% of indigenous murders or kidnappings that took place in “states affiliated with pipeline projects” had “occurred in counties where the Keystone Pipeline alone is proposed to be built.” Ocasio-Cortez did not explain how the future construction of the pipeline retroactively caused deaths and kidnappings to occur in the past..@AOC: ""Fossil Fuel extraction"" is correlated with ""abduction and murders of indigenous women across the United States"" pic.twitter.com/eUXYcNaJmQ— Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) March 17, 2022The hearing drew attention to the tangled, overlapping web of police jurisdictions that come into play at a reservation; unfortunately, not all of its conclusions were accurate.AOC’s witness — Angel Charley, executive director of the Coalition to Stop Violence Against Native Women — testified that oil and natural gas companies set up “man camps” for pipeline workers, who abuse American Indians with impunity, because “many tribes do not have tribal jurisdiction over non-Native workers.”Ocasio-Cortez asked whether this means criminals “essentially escape jurisdiction from having a clear path to accountability because of where these sites are happening.” Charley agreed.In fact, all crimes that take place on reservations are punishable — and some law enforcement officers say giving reservations more jurisdiction may reduce the number of prosecutions. “The FBI has exclusive jurisdiction for about 20 serious crimes on Indian land such as murder, rape, robbery, etc., and will come in and take over any investigation when and if those crimes occur,” Tim Dees, a former tribal law officer, explained. Some tribes allow local police departments to make arrests and bring charges on their land, while others entrust this exclusively to tribal law enforcement officers.Reservations are a frequent haven for American Indian fugitives. “Tribal governments are notoriously political, and taking enforcement action against a favored person, such as the tribal chairman’s nephew, could be fatal to one’s career,” Dees wrote. South Dakota reservations sheltered 22% of all active felony warrants issued by the Pennington County Sheriff’s Office in 2018.For her final question, Ocasio-Cortez asked Charley to explain “how this collaboration between law enforcement and fossil fuel companies puts indigenous women, in particular, at heightened risk of abduction and murder.”Charley cited no facts and replied with only one sentence: “This is a continuation of state violence against indigenous women.”“I think what we see here is that the data speaks [sic] for itself,” Ocasio-Cortez replied.The Bronx socialist’s comments came during a March 3 congressional hearing on “The Neglected Epidemic of Missing BIPOC Women and Girls.” The Democrat-controlled House Oversight and Reform Committee echoed MSNBC’s Joy Reid in bemoaning “missing white woman syndrome.” While the committee asserted without proof that “white women are given vastly higher levels of media attention than women of color,” it admitted “the problem is impossible to measure” due to a lack of data.In written testimony, Charley blamed the murder rate on “systemic racism” that is “rooted in the devaluation of [i]ndigenous lives since the onset of colonization.” But the committee said, “The disproportionate rate of missing Black and Indigenous women and girls can be attributed to … higher rates of intimate partner violence against BIPOC women than white women.” In 2016, the National Institute of Justice, a U.S. government institution, found American Indian and Alaska Native women were 1.6 times as likely as non-Hispanic white women to suffer domestic violence. The difference in the rate of sexual assaults was not statistically significant.Critics of the hearing suggested that AOC should spend more time focusing on her own district’s surging crime rate. “Are they drilling in NYC?” asked one Twitter user. New York City experienced 485 murders in 2021, and the number of major crimes committed in the Big Apple — such as homicide, rape, robbery, felonious assault, and burglary/grand theft — reached its highest level in five years.The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) claimed during a congressional hearing this week that there was a link between fossil fuel extraction and indigenous women being murdered.“We have a crisis of missing and murdered indigenous and black women in the United States,” she said. “Today I want to discuss part of this crisis that is all too often overlooked, but whose evidence shows that there’s a very meaningful connection here, the correlation between fossil fuel extraction sites, and abductions and murders of Indigenous women across the United States. We’re very lucky to have Ms. Angel Charley here with us today to start that conversation. Ms. Charley, let’s start at the top. Can you draw a brief introductory picture of how fossil fuel extraction efforts expose Indigenous women to physical and often sexual violence? Why is it that oil, gas, and fossil fuel extraction sites have such a high correlation of violence and abduction against native women?”“Fossil fuel industry creates man camps, or temporary settlements, that often exist right outside the outside the border lands of indigenous communities,” Charley responded. “As I stated earlier, many tribes do not have tribal jurisdiction over non-native offenders, which a majority of these oil workers are. We know that when these man camps or temporary establishments are created, that there is an increase in violence and particularly sexual violence against our native women.”“So when there’s a fossil fuel extraction site that is placed on a reservation, and those workers, oil company workers, go to the reservation, have that site, if they commit a crime, and commit violence against indigenous women, you’re saying that they essentially escape jurisdiction from having a clear path to accountability because of where these sites are happening.

Why has the Russian Federation decided to cosplay the Nazi Third Reich by attacking the peaceful neighboring state and plunging the region into war? What are the reasons and what is the plan?” Kyslytsya asked.He then deepened the comparison to the Nazi regime by suggesting that the Russians intended to kill Ukrainian children specifically, noting that civilians had been targeted on numerous occasions and claiming that Russian occupation forces also intentionally targeted children.“Yesterday, we got the answer: killing Ukrainian children, 108 innocent souls so far. Let me quote again: ‘success and in strict accordance with the plans approved previously,’ according to Putin,” Kyslytsya continued. “Children are deliberate targets, given yesterday’s bombardment of the Mariupol Drama Theater, a shelter for hundreds of local residents, mostly women and children. Despite the big signs, ‘Children’ painted on the road on both sides of the building being clearly visible, Russian pilots dropped an aerial bomb. The building was fully damaged, but the shelter fortunately withstood. It did not turn into one of our mass graves, as Putin’s plan probably envisaged, previously approved.”Nebenzya claimed that Russia was also concerned that medical facilities in Ukraine had been destroyed, but he claimed that he had no knowledge of who might be at fault.WATCH:Russian Ambassador to the UN Vasily Nebenzya, via translator: “Who is at fault when it comes to destroying medical facilities in Ukraine is something we have many questions about.”(It is quite clear who is at fault: Putin and Russia.) pic.twitter.com/UBOIoqbuM9— The Recount (@therecount) March 17, 2022“Who is at fault when it comes to destroying medical facilities in Ukraine is something we have many questions about,” he said through a translator.Russia's UN envoy Vasily Nebenzya on Ukraine assualt: – Denies Moscow bombed Mariupol theater– Accuses Nazi groups of not letting people leave– Western countries fuelling conflict by providing weapons pic.twitter.com/TGZAA5oVjy— TRT World Now (@TRTWorldNow) March 17, 2022In addition, he accused Nazi groups of refusing to allow people to leave Ukraine, flatly denied that Moscow was behind the bombing of the Mariupol theater, and claimed that the conflict between Russia and Ukraine was being exacerbated by western countries that were providing Ukraine with weapons.The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

A National Transportation Safety Board spokesman confirmed this week that a 13-year-old was driving the pickup truck involved in a fatal car crash that left nine people dead, including six college golf teammates from the University of the Southwest and the team’s head coach.A van carrying members of the golf team leaving Midland College crashed with a Ford pickup truck outside Andrews, Texas, on Tuesday night, KOAT Action News reported.The driver of the pickup truck, who has now been identified as a 13-year-old, “crossed the median into the northbound lane” and crashed into the university’s van, the report said.TXDPS Troopers say the pickup truck was traveling southbound on FM 1788 and crossed the median into the northbound lane. After the truck crossed the median it crashed into the van from the University of the Southwest. Both vehicles caught fire shortly after the crash. The team was traveling back to Hobbs from a golf tournament in Midland, TX.The truck’s left front tire blew out before impact, according to National Transportation Safety Board Vice Chairman Bruce Landsberg, the report detailed.“A Dodge 2500 pickup was traveling southbound on FM 1788. A Ford Transit passenger van registered to the University of the Southwest in Hobbs, NM was traveling northbound on FM 1788,” the Texas Department of Public Safety said in a statement earlier this week, The Daily Wire reported.“For unknown reasons, the Dodge pickup drove into the northbound lane and struck the Ford passenger van head on,” DPS Sgt. Steven Blanco said. “Both vehicles caught fire and burned.”The child who was driving, whose name has not been disclosed, was breaking Texas law by driving underage. He was driving with a 38-year-old man identified as Heinrich Siemens. Both died in the crash.“We are still learning the details about the accident but we are devastated and deeply saddened to learn about the loss of our students’ lives and their coach,” University of the Southwest President Quint Thurman said in a statement, reacting to the tragedy. “My understanding is that two of our students have survived and have been airlifted to University hospital in Lubbock with serious injuries. We would ask for prayers for their recovery and for comfort and strength for all of families and friends and students of those whose lives have been lost.”“We extend our condolences to the USW family,” Midland College President Dr. Steve Thomas said. “This is a devastating loss to that school, and words cannot express how deeply hurt we feel for their loss. I have ordered the MC flag to fly at half-staff through Friday to honor the memories of Coach Tyler James and his team.”The Texas Department of Public Safety is currently investigating the wreck, and the National Transportation Safety Board will be providing assistance.Related: Nine Dead In Fiery Car Crash, Including Students And Coach On University Of The Southwest Golf TeamsThe Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

Federal law enforcement officials revealed this week that they had charged five alleged Chinese spies for carrying out harassment campaigns against U.S. residents who were critical of the communist Chinese government.The Department of Justice (DOJ) said that the crimes were related to efforts by China’s secret police, the Ministry of State Security (MSS), to suppress voices of Chinese nationals who speak out against the government.Three of the five individuals who were charged have been taken into custody, including Fan “Frank” Liu, Matthew Ziburis, and Shujun Wang. The other two individuals, Qiming Lin and Qiang “Jason” Sun, remain at large.The DOJ said in a statement:According to court documents, all the defendants allegedly perpetrated transnational repression schemes to target U.S. residents whose political views and actions are disfavored by the PRC government, such as advocating for democracy in the PRC. In one of these schemes, the co-conspirators sought to interfere with federal elections by allegedly orchestrating a campaign to undermine the U.S. congressional candidacy of a U.S. military veteran who was a leader of the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing, PRC. In another of these schemes, three defendants planned to destroy the artwork of a PRC national residing in Los Angeles that was critical of the PRC government, and planted surveillance equipment in the artist’s workplace and car to spy on him from the PRC.“The Ministry of State Security is more than an intelligence collection agency. It executes the Chinese government’s efforts to limit free speech, attack dissidents, and preserve the power of the Communist Party,” said Assistant Director Alan E. Kohler Jr. of the FBI’s Counterintelligence Division. “When it exports those actions overseas, it violates the fundamental sovereignty of the United States and becomes a national security threat. These indictments should serve as a stark warning to the MSS and all foreign intelligence agencies that their efforts at repression will not be tolerated within our borders.”The statement highlighted some of the following details about the five alleged spies:Qiming Lin, 59, of the PRC, is charged with conspiracy to commit interstate harassment, as well as conspiracy and attempt to use of a means of identification in connection with the interstate harassment conspiracy. As alleged, Lin works on behalf of the PRC’s Ministry of State Security (MSS). Beginning in September 2021, Lin hired a private investigator (the PI) in New York to disrupt the campaign of a Brooklyn resident currently running for U.S. Congress (the Victim), including by physically attacking the Victim. The Victim was a student leader of the pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in 1989, who later escaped to the United States, served in the U.S. military, and became a naturalized U.S. citizen. In September 2021, the Victim (then living in Long Island) announced his intention to run for a U.S. congressional seat on Long Island in the November 2022 general election.Shujun Wang, 73, of Queens, New York, is charged with acting as an agent of the PRC government, criminal use of means of identification and making materially false statements in connection with his participation in a transnational repression scheme orchestrated by the MSS. As alleged, Wang is a former visiting scholar and author who helped start a pro-democracy organization in Queens that memorializes two former leaders of the Chinese Communist Party who promoted political and economic reforms within the PRC and were eventually forced from power. Since at least 2015, however, Wang has secretly operated at the direction and control of several MSS officers. At the direction of the MSS, Wang used his position and status within Chinese diaspora community in New York City to collect information about prominent activists, dissidents, and human rights leaders to report that information to the PRC government. While ostensibly lending a sympathetic ear, Wang reported on statements activists made in confidence to him, including on their views on democracy in the PRC, as well as planned speeches, writings, and demonstrations against the Chinese Communist Party. … In April 2020, one victim about whom Wang reported – the Hong Kong democracy activist identified in the complaint as Hong Kong Dissident #1 – was arrested in Hong Kong and jailed on political charges. In addition, in April 2019, Wang flew from the PRC to Queens carrying a handwritten document with the names and non-public contact information for dozens of other well-known PRC dissidents, including other Hong Kong democracy activists who were subsequently arrested by the PRC in 2019 and 2020. The complaint also alleges that, during an interview in Queens on Aug. 2, 2017, Wang lied to federal law enforcement, falsely denying that he had contacts with PRC officials or the MSS when in fact he had been secretly reporting on U.S. residents to the MSS. Wang later admitted much of his criminal conduct to an undercover member of law enforcement and during a subsequent interview with agents.Fan “Frank” Liu, 62, of Long Island, New York, and Matthew Ziburis, 49, of Oyster Bay New York, are charged with conspiring to act as agents of the PRC government. Liu, Ziburis and co-defendant Quiang “Jason” Sun, 40, of the PRC, are charged with conspiring to commit interstate harassment and criminal use of a means of identification. Liu and Sun are charged with conspiring to bribe a federal official in connection with their scheme to obtain the tax returns of a pro-democracy activist residing in the United States. According to the complaint, Liu is president of a purported media company based in New York City, while Ziburis is a former correctional officer for the State of Florida and a bodyguard. Sun is a PRC-based employee of an international technology company. According to the complaint, Liu and Ziburis have been operating under Sun’s direction and control to discredit pro-democracy PRC dissidents residing in the United States – including in New York City, California and Indiana – by spying on them and disseminating negative information about them. For example, at Sun’s direction, Liu paid a private investigator in Queens to bribe an IRS employee to obtain the federal tax returns of one of the dissidents. The private investigator was cooperating with law enforcement, and no Internal Revenue Service employee received a bribe payment. The defendants planned to publicly disclose the dissident’s potential tax liabilities to discredit him. The co-conspirators also made plans to destroy the artwork of a dissident artist whose work is critical of the PRC government, and the artist’s sculpture depicting PRC President Xi Jinping as a coronavirus molecule was demolished in the Spring 2021. Sun has paid both Liu and Ziburis for these efforts to stalk, harass and surveil dissidents residing in the United States. As part of their efforts, the defendants electronically allegedly spied on the pro-democracy activists. For example, posing as an art dealer interested in purchasing the artwork of the dissident artist, Ziburis secretly installed surveillance cameras and GPS devices at a dissident’s workplace and in his car. While in the PRC, Sun watched the live video feed and location data from these devices. The defendants made similar plans to install surveillance equipment at the residences and on the vehicles of two other dissidents. Liu and Ziburis planned to gain access to one such residence by posing as a member of an international sports committee.The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) teased on Thursday morning that she would be reading a poem written by Bono for the Ukrainian people at Congress’ annual Friends of St. Patrick luncheon that afternoon. It was seemingly out of the blue and the instant reaction on Twitter was simple: “Why?”At the luncheon, she read poetry by the lead singer of U2, Bono — who is an Irishman himself. It compared St. Patrick to Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelensky.Based on tweets, it seems that “Why?” transformed into more of a “What in the world?” The spectacle was truly bizarre.As flagged by Greg Price, Pelosi told the media Thursday morning, “I will be reading a poem written by Bono about Ukraine which you might find interesting.”Many people did, but not for the reasons the speaker may have hoped.Miranda Devine of the New York Post quipped, “Third in line. 81 years old. Unhinged.”Third in line. 81 years old. Unhinged. https://t.co/XGspycexUi— Miranda Devine (@mirandadevine) March 17, 2022One Twitter user opined, “Good god this is getting worse every single day. The kabuki theater and virtue signaling from hell. Only war escalation and zero efforts toward peace. This country is lost.”Good god this is getting worse every single day. The kabuki theater and virtue signaling from hell. Only war escalation and zero efforts toward peace. This country is lost— Paisano™ (@Paisano) March 17, 2022The phrase ‘Kabuki theater’ is a reference to a form of Japanese dramas, featuring heavy acting and elaborate costumes. The bad news for Americans everywhere is that is isn’t fiction. It was real life. There were dozens, if not hundreds, more mocking Pelosi.Just prior to introducing River Dance at the luncheon, Pelosi read the poem by Bono. To put it in layman’s terms, it was even more cringe-worthy than one would expect.“I got this message this morning from Bono,” Pelosi said before reading the rhyme. “Most of us — whether we’re in Ireland or here — Bono has been a very Irish part of our lives,” she added.The full poem can be found here:Oh Saint Patrick he drove out the snakes; With his prayers but that’s not all it takes; For the snake symbolizes; An evil that rises; And hides in your heart; As it breaks; And the evil has risen my friends; From the darkness that lives in some men; But in sorrow and fear; That’s when saints can appear; To drive out those old snakes once again; And they struggle for us to be free; From the psycho in this human family; Ireland’s sorrow and pain; Is now the Ukraine; And Saint Patrick’s name now Zelenskyy.In response, The Federalist’s Ben Domenech tweeted something many readers might be wondering at this point, “Is this a prank? Did someone pretend to be Bono and sent her this?”Is this a prank? Did someone pretend to be Bono and sent her this?— Ben Domenech (@bdomenech) March 17, 2022But it was not a prank at all. Pelosi was serious.And it’s not the first time Pelosi has offered an off-key attempt to commemorate something.On January 6, Pelosi invited the cast of the broadway musical “Hamilton” to preform one of its songs and discuss equity.That was pretty bizarre, but the poem by Bono may have topped it.Consider this: on Wednesday, Zelensky asked for a no-fly zone and America to come to Ukraine’s assistance. That would have been the start of World War III, so America sent nearly a billion more dollars in aid to Ukraine instead.But, Pelosi tacking on a poem by Bono likely did not strike strike any fear into the heart of Russian President Vladimir Putin or inspire the Ukrainian people.It may have done just the opposite.The views expressed in this piece are the author’s own and do not necessarily represent those of The Daily Wire.Enter for the chance to hang out with Gina Carano at the premiere of her new Daily Wire movie, Terror on the Prairie!

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki gave a condescending reply to NBC Correspondent Kristen Welker when the latter — who had just questioned President Joe Biden about his administration’s refusal to send military planes to Ukraine — pressed her on the same subject.Welker attended Biden’s Wednesday speech, during which he announced some $800 million more in aid to Ukraine amid the ongoing Russian invasion — and she asked why, despite pressure from both sides of the political aisle, he was not ready to supply MiGs to Ukraine to assist with air defense.Biden refused to address the question outright. “I’m not going to comment on that right now. I’m not going to comment on anything other than what I have told you today. Thank you,” he said.Biden leaves after his latest remarks on Ukraine without taking questions from reporters, with NBC's Kristen Welker interjecting w/a MiGs question: ""I'm not going to comment on that right now.

Thank you."" pic.twitter.com/KJ1nBQohtr— Curtis Houck (@CurtisHouck) March 16, 2022Hours later, Welker joined the rest of the press corps for a briefing from Psaki — where she again attempted to get the White House’s reasoning for not sending planes or facilitating the transfer of MiGs that had already been offered by Poland.“And I want to go back to the MiGs quickly and just be crystal clear about what you’re saying. Because when I asked the president about this earlier, he said he’s not going to comment. He didn’t say that it’s not an option. So —” Welker began.“Well, we’ve spoken to it approximately 167 times. So, maybe he —” Psaki replied.“Well, here’s 168,” Welker shot back.WATCH:Jen Psaki and NBC's Kristen Welker Do Battle Over Sending MiGs to Ukraine https://t.co/2K1BzKFPwV via @mediaite pic.twitter.com/smqPZT3njZ— Tommy moderna-vaX-Topher (@tommyxtopher) March 17, 2022“Go ahead. Go ahead,” Psaki conceded, prompting laughs from the press corps.“There’s a growing — there’s a growing number of Republicans and Democrats who are supporting the U.S. striking a deal with Poland to send the MiGs. You have Elise Stefanik earlier today saying Ukraine ‘needs those MiGs.’ You have Scalise saying, ‘Getting [those] MiGs in immediately is…critical.’ There’s a growing chorus of voices saying that now is the time,” Welker explained, asking, “Has the president reconsidered his stance at all at this point?”Psaki pushed back, saying that the military made the assessments with regard to what would be the best and most effective aid to send to Ukraine. She also noted that Ukraine already had a number of “mission-capable aircraft that are not being utilized,” and that the United States did not view sending more to be the highest priority.“But they don’t think that’s enough, Jen. You heard President Zelensky,” Welker continued.“This is the assessment by our Defense Department,” Psaki repeated, adding, “They’re also assessing that the transfer to Ukraine may be mistaken as escalatory.”Psaki concluded by repeating that the Defense Department had come to the conclusion that sending MiGs would not change the overall effectiveness of Ukraine’s air defense, making the risk of escalation not worth taking.“We certainly understand. We share the passion, the anger, the horror at what we’re seeing.

On Wednesday, sports columnist Jason Whitlock reacted harshly to the news that Michigan football coach Jim Harbaugh had celebrated his “history-making” decision to add a starting point guard on the Georgetown basketball team as female graduate assistant to his football coaching staff. Whitlock snapped, “American men have taken the role of Dr. Jack Kevorkian. We’re assisting in our own death, undermining our role as leaders, shirking our responsibility to shepherd God’s garden.”“We’ve embraced the diversity, inclusion, and equity religion favored by women, the LGBTQ+ community, and race idolaters,” he explained. “This carefully constructed coalition of Marxists constitutes the foot soldiers of global elites. They evangelize and communicate through Silicon Valley’s social media apps.”“The fundamental tenet and organizing principle of D.I.E. (diversity, inclusion and equity) is that Christian men are the bane of society and the obstacle stopping women, the gender-confused, and people of color from realizing their American dream. The goal of D.I.E. is to kill Christian men and dislodge masculine, traditional men from American power,” he asserted. “We, men, are collaborating with our enemies. We pat ourselves on the back and bask in glory every time we weaken our grip on leadership.”Whitlock said of Harbaugh’s choice, Mimi Bolden-Morris, “Do we think Bolden-Morris’ drive to coach football supersedes the thousands of boys and men who play the game? I’m suspicious. I think her and Harbaugh’s desire to build their individual brands by any means necessary supersedes most people’s. Corporate media is obsessed with forced diversity. Harbaugh and Bolden-Morris are seizing an opportunity to capitalize on the obsession.”Whitlock pointed out Bolden-Morris said, “It speaks volumes to the efforts that Coach Harbaugh has made to create an environment of inclusion. These opportunities have been an anomaly for a black woman until recently.”“There it is. The race card,” Whitlock snapped. “Played to ward off criticism of Harbaugh’s publicity stunt. Played so the public is blinded to the real agenda. A college football coach’s job is to mold men, not create an inclusive environment that meets the diversity standards of the D.I.E. religion. ““There was a time in America in which molding men into leaders was a high priority,” he declared. “That era strengthened America, made us the envy of the world. Now China prioritizes building strong men while we seek to strengthen men who want to be women and women who want to be men. … For the gods of diversity, inclusion, and equity, there’s no more courageous sacrifice than renouncing manhood. The only thing that remotely compares is turning over leadership responsibility to women, particularly the role of developing boys into men.”He mocked, “Jim Harbaugh might win the ESPY Award for courage this year. Or maybe it will be Apple CEO Tim Cook. This week, Apple released a new series of emojis that included pregnant men. Men can’t get pregnant. Caitlyn Jenner and Tifanny Abreu can have a $100 million in surgery and they’ll still never carry a baby.”“Despite their best efforts, the gods of D.I.E. cannot overrule God’s design,” he wrote.He concluded, “Jim Harbaugh, Tim Cook, and Adidas are preaching from the exact same diversity, inclusion, and equity bible as the overwhelming majority of American ministers and Christians, the real doctors of death.”The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

Students Want Him Fired.By  Ashe Schow•Mar 17, 2022   DailyWire.com•FacebookTwitterMailDesiree Navarro/WireImage
A top psychiatrist at Columbia University Irving Medical Center commented on a photo of model Nyakim Gatwech, who is of South Sudanese descent, and now the doctor’s been suspended – with students demanding he be fired.On February 21, psychiatrist Jeffrey Lieberman quote-tweeted an image of Gatwech. The original tweet said that Gatwech was “not a work of art made of black stone or granite.”The tweeted added, falsely, that Gatwech is “in the Guinness Book of World Records for having the darkest skin ever seen on earth.”Lieberman quote-tweeted the image and tweet and added: “Whether a work of art or freak of nature she’s a beautiful sight to behold.”This tweet, which had nothing to do with Lieberman’s job at Columbia, caught the attention of Gatwech, who posted it on her Instagram account. Gatwech underlined the words “a work of” and “or freak of nature,” but did not say she found the phrases offensive. She did, however, take issue with the original tweet’s claim that she was in the Guinness Book of World Records for her skin color.“It’s time I address a a [sic] rumor ONCE and for all. I have no idea where it originated, but my manager first brought it to my attention in 2020 and although we’ve denied it to multiple fact-checkers, clearly it’s still floating around even after @guinnessworldrecords stated that it does NOT monitor skin tones. I can’t imagine it’s even possible to know who’s the lightest or darkest person on the planet!” Gatwech wrote. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Nyakim Gatwech (@queennyakimofficial)Lieberman’s tweet caught the attention of someone at Columbia, prompting him to send an apology to his peers prior to his suspension. In his email, Lieberman apologized for his “racist and sexist” tweet, The New York Times reported. He also said he was “deeply ashamed” of his “prejudices and stereotypical assumptions.”“An apology from me to the Black community, to women, and to all of you is not enough,” Lieberman wrote in the email, according to The Times. “I’ve hurt many, and I am beginning to understand the work ahead to make needed personal changes and over time to regain your trust.”Lieberman was suspended and “removed from his position as psychiatrist-in-chief at Columbia University Irving Medical Center/NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital,” the outlet noted.That all happened in late February. The College Fix reported that students don’t think Lieberman was punished enough for his tweet, which may have been poorly worded but was clearly meant as a complement to Gatwech. A group of unsigned psychiatry residents and graduates wrote an open letter on March 6 demanding Lieberman be fired as a faculty member, claiming his tweet was just one example of a “pattern of insensitive and offensive behavior.”The letter claimed his tweet was “clearly racist and sexist” and a “brazen dehumanization of black women.” Further, the residents and graduates claimed Lieberman’s wording “so clearly recall structural violence perpetrated against historically marginalized communities.”“…His permanent removal is one of many ways we can demonstrate to our community that regardless of status and title, Columbia has zero tolerance and is committed to combatting prejudice and bias in medicine,” the letter said.The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

The White House is accusing Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of misinforming the public through his allegations that the president’s Supreme Court nominee “has a pattern of letting child porn offenders off the hook for their appalling crimes.”White House spokesman Andrew Bates said in a Thursday statement that Hawley’s comments were “toxic and weakly-presented misinformation that relies on taking cherry-picked elements of her record out of context.”“It buckles under the lightest scrutiny,” said Bates, according to Washington Post reporter Seung Min Kim.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Daily Wire.The White House response, from @AndrewJBates46: “This is toxic and weakly-presented misinformation that relies on taking cherry-picked elements of her record out of context – and it buckles under the lightest scrutiny.” https://t.co/N51nRmWwQ1— Seung Min Kim (@seungminkim) March 17, 2022The Missouri Republican went public Wednesday evening with allegations against Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson in a Twitter thread that expressed concerns that Jackson’s record “endangers our children.”Hawley warned that as far back as during Jackson’s time in law school, the judge has questioned whether convicts should be made to register as sex offenders and said that it leads to “stigmatization and ostracism.”“She’s suggested public policy is driven by a ‘climate of fear, hatred & revenge’ against sex offenders,” Hawley said in a Twitter thread.“It gets worse,” he warned. “As a member of the U.S. Sentencing Commission, Judge Jackson advocated for drastic change in how the law treats sex offenders by eliminating the existing mandatory minimum sentences for child porn.”And according to Hawley, Jackson has said that some people in possession of child pornography “are in this for either the collection, or the people who are loners and find status in their participation in the community.”“What community would that be?” he asked. “The community of child exploiters.”The Missouri Republican further said that Jackson has suggested there may be a type of “less-serious child pornography offender” whose motivation is not sexual, and noted that during Jackson’s time on the U.S. Sentencing Commission, Jackson said she “mistakingly assumed that child pornography offenders are pedophiles.”The Daily Wire has not independently confirmed the senator’s claims, which come ahead of the Supreme Court nominee’s confirmation hearings next week.Jackson’s nomination process has been spearheaded by Left-wing judicial activism nonprofits like Demand Justice, an organization flush with cash with a massive 2022 budget.Demand Justice did not immediately respond to The Daily Wire’s request for comment on Hawley’s allegations.Filings examined by Axios show that one of Demand Justice’s board members is The Nation justice correspondent Elie Mystal, who recently sparked a backlash by calling the Constitution “kind of trash” on The View.Demand Justice has refused to weigh in to The Daily Wire on Mystal’s controversial comments, prompting sharp criticism from conservative groups like Judicial Crisis Network and Americans for Public Trust.“Left-wing dark money groups in the Arabella Advisors network spent a jaw-dropping amount of money in 2020 to help elect Joe Biden and Senate Democrats,” Judicial Crisis Network President Carrie Severino said in a February statement.  “These groups have done everything in their power to corrupt the judiciary and the judicial nominations process, from running smear campaigns against Justices Kavanaugh and Barrett to pushing radical court packing reforms to even intimidating Justice Breyer into retirement.”“Now that they have a vacancy, they want payback for their dark money spending in the form of a Supreme Court justice who will be a rubber stamp for their unpopular and far-left political agendas.”The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

Marina Ovsyannikova, the journalist who went viral after she interrupted a live Russian state-run news program to protest the invasion of Ukraine, spoke with the BBC after she was detained, saying that Russians are “zombified” by propaganda.“I understand it’s very hard… to find alternative information, but you need to try to look for it,” Ovsyannikova, an editor at the state-run Channel 1, said.“I was aware that if I went to protest in [Moscow’s] central square I would be arrested like everyone else and thrown into a police van and be put on trial,” Ovsyannikova said. “Half the poster was in Russian, half the poster was in English. I really wanted to show the Western audience that some Russians are against war.”“I feel of course some responsibility lying on me. I was an ordinary cog in the propaganda machine. Until the very last moment I didn’t think about it too much,” she said.“There are lots of conspiracy theories building up about me,” she said, on the subject of accusations made against her in Russian media. “That’s why I had to explain to the world what really happened, the fact that I am just a normal Russian woman, but I could not remain on the sidelines.”AFP via Getty ImagesEarlier this week, Ovsyannikova stormed the set of a Channel 1 evening live broadcast with a sign in English reading: “No War.”The sign also included messages like, “Don’t believe the propaganda” and “you are being lied to,” written in Russian.According to human rights group OVD-Info, she was subsequently detained and taken into custody by Russian authorities.“Russia is the aggressor. The responsibility for this aggression lies on the conscience of only one person and this person is Vladimir Putin,” she said in a pre-recorded video. “My father is Ukrainian, my mother is Russian, and they were never enemies.”“I am ashamed that I allowed [Channel 1] to tell lies from the TV screen. I am ashamed of letting Russian people get zombied,”  Ovsyannikova said. “We just quietly watched this antihuman regime.”After her protest, the Kremlin dismissed Ovsyannikova as participating in “hooliganism.”“As far as this woman is concerned, this is hooliganism,” said Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesperson. “The channel and those who are supposed to will get to the bottom of this.”Ovsyannikova says that she was detained and questioned by police for 14 hours, and was fined 30,000 roubles ($280), adding that authorities are convinced that she was acting on someone else’s behalf.“Nobody believed it was my personal decision. They suggested it could be conflict at work, relatives who were angry about Ukraine or that I was doing it for Western special services,” she said. “They couldn’t believe that I had so many objections to the government that I could not stay silent.”Ian Haworth is a writer for The Daily Wire and contributor to Morning Wire.

Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis (FL) blasted President Joe Biden this week over general inflation — which DeSantis dubbed as “Bidenflation” — and the rising costs of rent and gas.Responding to a question about rising rents in Florida, DeSantis said “general inflation is causing” rents to spike, and noted of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) moratorium on evictions.“The CDC basically had a moratorium, so that people … really didn’t have to pay rent,” he said. “What’s happening is now all the people that own these properties are charging more to make up for what was [lost].”“Biden was warned about this,” DeSantis slammed. “He was told that this was going to happen and they had to take it all the way to the Supreme Court.”Last summer, the Supreme Court blocked the Biden administration from enforcing its eviction moratorium ordered by the CDC.“Then you also have the issue where there’s a lot of demand,” DeSantis said.The governor noted that people from across the nation are moving to Florida because they’re “fed up” with liberal policies. “This is kind of the center of the universe right now,” he said.DeSantis highlighted massive spending bills heightening inflation, too.“We warned about this inflation last year. They came in and did the massive spending; the Fed has printed trillions and trillions of dollars, the biggest increase in the money supple that we’ve seen in quite some time. Of course you’re going to have inflation when that happens.”“That’s what’s happened, and I don’t see it ebbing anytime soon,” DeSantis predicated. “I think this is likely to be something that we’re going to have to contend with.”The Republican said the way to provide Americans relief from these rising prices is to “reverse” a lot of federal policies, which he said the Biden administration has “not shown an inclination to do.”“Make no mistake about it, what you need to do is reverse those policies that are causing the inflation to begin with,” he told the press.“Why are we not producing more energy here in the United States?” he queried, adding that we need more pipelines, natural gas, and permits for drilling.Speaking of ANWR (Arctic National Wildlife Refuge), Alaska, DeSantis said “there’s more oil and gas up there than in Saudi Arabia. It’s a massive, massive opportunity and basically from the time Biden’s come in, he said, ‘No, no, no.'”“Well, of course that’s going to cause [inflation], and it’s not just fuel prices,” the Republican explained. “When energy prices are going up the way they are, that permeates the entire economy. It’s more [expensive] to transport … goods … everything is permeated by that, and it helps contribute to rising prices.”“Let’s do what we can at the federal level to reverse some of the policies that have caused this,” DeSantis said. “And let’s try to give people relief throughout our economy, and if they did that it would make a really significant difference.  But they have not shown an inclination to do that.”WATCH:The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

A mother of a female swimmer in the Ivy League spoke out in an explosive video condemning those in charge for allowing a transgender swimmer, who is biologically male, to compete against females.The mother, who says her daughter has personally competed against Lia Thomas, complained that a “full-grown male” is now being allowed to “take” from female competitors and break their hard-earned records. She also claimed her daughter and other biologically female swimmers were warned by higher-ups not to speak about the transgender issue.“Holy cow, we’re going to talk about a male swimmer — a full-grown male — attempting to take down female icon records, and taking a spot on an Ivy team from one of the Penn swimmers, who have rightfully deserved it,” she told Independent Women’s Forum, according to the Post Millennial. “And we’re talking about, this person’s gonna swim on every relay going forward at championship meets, is going to take the position of a woman on a travel team, is going to take a space in every finals.”Girls are “frightened” to speak out about the inequality after they were warned to keep their mouths shut, the mother explained.“And they’re frightened,” the woman said, her voice shaking with emotion. “They’re frightened of losing friends. They’re frightened of being kicked off their teams. They’re frightened of being told by their universities that they’re transphobic and hateful.”Independent Women’s Forum identified the woman as “Margaret,” captioning the video: “Margaret’s* daughter is a swimmer in the Ivy League who’s been forced to compete all season against XY athlete Will ‘Lia’ Thomas. Thomas — who competed for three years on the University of Pennsylvania Men’s Swim Team — has dominated women’s collegiate swimming competitions this season and broken numerous female legacy records.”“The NCAA, USA Swimming, the Ivy League, and University of Pennsylvania have all turned their backs on female athletes,” the group said. “When biological males are allowed to swim on women’s teams, female athletes lose. They lose opportunities to win and to compete. And… they lose self-confidence. Dividing athletes by biological sex gives women the chance to compete and win.”The mother said she fears for her daughter but felt she needed to speak out about the injustice.“I don’t want my daughter to have any repercussions based upon my desire to speak out for sex-based rights and representation for women,” she said. “She deserves to have a college experience unmarred by this issue, and she deserves to have the time and ability to process what’s going on with her in her own way.”“At the end of the day, I hope that the IOC, the NCAA, and governing bodies of sport all recognize that women are women,” the woman closed. “We can’t shrug off our sex. Men are men, they can’t shrug off their sex, and women’s sports is protected for females.”WATCH:The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

         — 
    


      You’re probably not too happy with your grocery bills these days. But there are strategies to help you shop without breaking the bank.
  

      Food prices rose 1% in February, the largest monthly increase since April 2020. Over the past 12 months, overall food prices increased 7.9%, the biggest jump since July 1981. Grocery store prices rose at an even faster clip.
  

      Every food item tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics was more expensive last month than it was a year ago. Meat, eggs and soup prices have the widest gap from last year, jumping by double-digits through February.
  

      “When it comes to saving money on groceries, consumers have many options, but it does require making changes to our routines and some savvy decision making,” said Carman Allison at NielsenIQ.
  

      Here are some penny-pinching tactics recommended by the pros.
  

    Make a shopping list 


      Grocery stores are well trained in the science of stimulating your taste buds. 
  

      The best way to avoid impulsive buys that add to your grocery bill? Make a list beforehand of what you’re there buy — and stick to it. Don’t get distracted by all those desserts and snacks that aren’t on your list. 
  

      Planning ahead and shopping with a list help keep you focused on what you need and reduces time browsing around, where temptations can take hold. 
  

      Be deliberate at the store and don’t add extra stuff to your cart while you wait in the checkout line, where stores tend to put hard-to-resist sweets and other eye-catching items.
  

    Shop around


      Finding the best deals means shopping around and comparing prices on products at different stores. One might have better prices on eggs, but another might be cheaper for fish.
  

      “I do not have allegiance to any one supermarket. If you’ve got the best price, you’re my best friend at that moment,” said Edgar Dworsky, a former assistant attorney general in Massachusetts and founder of Consumer World, an education resource.
  

      But don’t just compare prices among the same types of stores. Supermarkets, big box outlets, wholesale clubs, discount grocers and dollar store chains all have different prices and promotion strategies. Check out co-ops and farmers’ markets too.
  

      “People can save a lot of money if they know how these stores are set up,” said Victor Martino, the founder of grocery consulting firm Third Wave Strategies. He recommends shopping at at least two different store formats.
  

    Look for promotions and deals


      Stores put out weekly advertisements for sale items in print and online. 
  

      Find out when a store releases those offers. Many put out their circular ads on Wednesdays, so that’s often the best day to find deals. Check them out and compare.
  

      If there’s a great deal, consider stocking up on the product.
  

      “When apple juice is 99 cents a gallon, I will buy a case or two,” Dworsky said.
  

      And to make sure you’re actually getting a good deal, take a look at the price history of products on websites such as CamelCamelCamel.
  

    Use a store loyalty card


      Most supermarkets offer free loyalty cards with special deals and savings for members. Some grocers’ loyalty cards also offer savings on gas. 
  

      Use them.
  

      If you’re not using a loyalty card, “you’re throwing money away,” Dworsky said. “It’s absolutely crazy.” 
  

    Switch to store brands


      Stores’ private-label brands used to be considered cheap knockoffs. But grocers have spent a lot of time and money in recent years improving their products.
  

      House brands are often produced by the same manufacturers that make the big-name items, but they’re typically cheaper. Switching to a private label alternative can save shoppers anywhere from 10% to 40%, according to David Bishop, a partner at grocery consulting firm Brick Meets Click.
  

      Experts consider Costco’s Kirkland Signature to be one of the top private-label brands. Other store brands include Great Value from Walmart, Simple Truth from Kroger and Good & Gather from Target.
  

    Beware of ‘shrinkflation’


      Less cereal in the box. Smaller snack sizes. Ice cream gone missing in a container.
  

      You’re not losing your mind. You are actually paying the same price or more these days for everyday items but running through them more quickly because their sizes have shrunk.
  

      The reason? A sneaky tactic known as “shrinkflation,” deployed by consumer product brands and grocery stores. The phenomenon has been going on for decades, but it typically becomes more common when companies’ costs go up, such as during the inflation surge we are seeing today.
  

      There’s a way to beat shrinkflation though, say experts: Compare unit pricing — the price per ounce or per 100-count — on similar products to see which is the better deal.
  

    Buy frozen meat and veggies


      Meat has seen some of the sharpest price increases during the pandemic.
  

      In February, meat prices rose 14% from a year ago. Chicken was right behind, up 13%.
  

      “Frozen chicken breasts are good quality, can be defrosted one at a time and the savings are significant,” said David D’Arezzo, a former chief merchant at Dollar General and an executive at pharmacy and supermarket chains.
  

      Frozen vegetables are also a good option, he said. They don’t go bad or spoil like fresh vegetables, a hit to your wallet.
  

      Another tip for buying veggies: Buy them at peak season. If you buy tomatoes or other produce when they’re off season, you’re likely to pay more.
  

      “If you shop seasonally, you can save 25% to 30%,” said Martino of Third Wave Strategies.
  

    Look for ugly produce


      Look at the day-old produce racks or produce outlets in your area to save.
  

      There are also “ugly” produce sellers online such as Imperfect Foods and Misfits Market that buy and resell quality fruit and vegetables that grocery stores have rejected at steep discounts.
  

      “Why not pay half price for slightly-dinged produce?” Dworsky said.

Stephanie Griffin/CNN





      Like plenty of people, we’re wild about our pets. So much so that when we try a pet product that does what it’s supposed to — and our pets are just as obsessed with it as we are — we can’t shut up about it.
  

      So, wanna know the best pet products we’ve tried and tested with our pets? Ahead, our favorite cat toys, dog treats and more.
  

All for Paws Interactive Flutter Bug Cat Butterfly Toy


$19.99 $17.99 with 10% off coupon at Amazon






All for Paws Interactive Flutter Bug Cat Butterfly Toy
Chelsea Stone/CNN



      Beyond a shadow of a doubt, this is the best toy I’ve ever bought for Phoebe. The spinning butterfly keeps her entertained for hours — and allows me to get work done without a cat sitting on my keyboard or begging for pets. The only downside: Watching her try to catch the butterfly is so downright adorable, I have trouble staying focused on said work! (We’re also stocked up on replacement butterflies for when the wings inevitably get torn off.) — Chelsea Stone, senior commerce editor 


Ruffwear Quinzee Dog Jacket


    $74.95 at Amazon






Ruffwear Quinzee Dog Jacket
Kai Burkhardt/CNN



      Miso has a very thin coat and gets cold easily, so we got this insulated jacket from Ruffwear to keep her warm on our morning walks and when we go camping. It’s lightweight, packable and has clips on both sides so you don’t have to awkwardly pick up your dog’s legs to take it on and off. — Kai Burkhardt, associate editor 


Roverlund Out-of-Office Pet Carrier


    From $149 at Amazon and Roverlund






Roverlund Out-of-Office Pet Carrier
Stephanie Griffin/CNN



      I’ve struggled to find a stylish yet functional pet carrier that Teddy comfortably fits in — until now. Made with mountaineering-grade fabrics, this tough-as-nails Roverlund carrier fits up to 25 pounds (he is 21 pounds) and features storage pockets, a fleece-lined bed, openings for him to pop his head in and out and rope shoulder straps, making it super easy for me to carry around the airport, along with any other baggage I have with me. I love that this carrier also doubles as an everyday travel bag or a mobile dog bed next time we hit the road. And while I personally love the black and neon yellow, there are plenty of other color combos to choose from. — Stephanie Griffin, senior digital content strategist


EveryYay Gray Patched Pillowtop Lounger Orthopedic Dog Bed


    $99.99 at Petco






EveryYay Gray Patched Pillowtop Lounger Orthopedic Dog Bed
Katelyn Gendron/CNN



      My golden doodle, Maggie, turned 10 on Valentine’s Day, which means she’s a bit of a lovable old maid who needs a bed with orthopedic support for her hips and knees. The EveryYay Gray Patched Pillowtop Lounger Orthopedic Dog Bed from Petco has been a game changer for Maggie’s comfort and ensures that she can sleep comfortably throughout the night. — Katelyn Gendron, SEO manager


Pet Qwerks Dog Squeak Hedgehog


    $6.99 at Amazon






Pet Qwerks Dog Squeak Hedgehog
Mike Andronico/CNN



      No matter how many toys I buy Marie, she always goes back to her hedgehogs — particularly this round Pet Qwerks model I got for her birthday last year. She loves to chew on this plush’s giant nose, and its small, spherical design is perfect for her little Frenchie mouth. It also lets out an amusingly creepy laugh when you squeeze it, which is very fitting for my small monster. — Mike Andronico, senior tech writer 


Fable Pets The Game


    $55 at Fable






Fable Pets The Game
Stephanie Griffin/CNN



      This slow feeder from Fable Pets has been a staple in my household since day one. I personally love it because it keeps Teddy fed, obviously, but it also keeps him entertained for up to 30 minutes — meaning I can actually do work or chores without being bothered. It also can hold up to 1.5 cups of dry food and is dishwasher-friendly, which was initially a huge selling point for me. It sits pretty on our floor, and now Teddy tells us when he’s hungry by hitting The Game! — Stephanie Griffin, senior digital content strategist


Wild One Puppy Poo Kit


$32 $30 at Wild One






Wild One Puppy Poo Kit
Hayley Saltzman/CNN



      These poop bags are the best ones I’ve tried. They have a slightly less slippery feel, which makes them much easier to open and use than some of the other ones I’ve tried. The best part, however, is the twist-top poop bag carrier, which attaches to my dog’s leash and ensures I’m never caught without a poop bag on a walk. It’s super easy to refill, plus it’s cute! — Hayley Saltzman, head of social 


Catit Senses 2.0 Flower Fountain


$38.99 $27.99 at Amazon






Catit Senses 2.0 Flower Fountain
Tobey Grumet/CNN



      The best part about having a cat as a pet is that you can leave them alone for a day or two without worrying (too much). Yeah, I love my cat, but she’s cool with some alone time once in a while. And though I still feel a bit guilty heading out, at least I know this flower-shaped cat fountain will give her access to filtered drinking water while we’re away. Simple to clean and put together, you’ll need to fill it only about once or twice a week and change the filter about once a month. Plus, it won’t annoy you when you’re home because it runs extremely quietly. — Tobey Grumet, contributing editor 


Little Beast The Super Duper Reversible Parka Vest


    $88 at Little Beast






Little Beast The Super Duper Reversible Parka Vest
Stephanie Griffin/CNN



      Teddy is a diva and is undoubtedly very, very, VERY particular when it comes to pet clothing. So as you might expect, I was thrilled when he first strolled around in his adorable new parka vest from Little Beast without trying to rip it off within the first five seconds of having it on. Both lightweight and warm, this parka vest is reversible and features Velcro attachments, which makes it extremely easy to take on and off. Teddy rocks a size large, and I am still waiting for Little Beast to come out with the adult version so we can match! — Stephanie Griffin, senior digital content strategist


PetFusion Ultimate Cat Scratcher Lounge


    From $49.95 at Amazon






PetFusion Ultimate Cat Scratcher Lounge
CNN/Chelsea Stone



      There has never been a happier feline than my beloved cat, Phoebe, splayed out on this PetFusion Ultimate Cat Scratcher Lounge. Not only is the lounge’s loopy shape aesthetically pleasing, but it also provides the perfect indentation for Phoebe to nestle into while she takes her morning (and afternoon, and evening) naps and does her daily patrol of the windowsill. Plus, the lounge doubles as a scratcher, which is great news for my couch. She clearly loves it, and I, her doting mom, love how much she loves it. — Chelsea Stone, commerce editor


Kong Stuff A Ball Dog Toy


$15.99 $13.99 at Chewy






Kong Stuff A Ball Dog Toy
Kai Burkhardt/CNN



      Miso has a very active mind but is a destructive chewer, so there are only a few toys she can really go to town on that won’t fall apart. We fill this ball with treats and she chews away for hours trying to get them out. After months of abuse, it still looks as good as new. — Kai Burkhardt, associate editor 


Weewooday Holiday Bandana Set for Dogs


    $15.99 at Amazon






Weewooday Holiday Bandana Set for Dogs
Katelyn Gendron/CNN



      Maggie loves “jewelry,” and by jewelry I mean sweaters, collars and bandanas. You ask her if she wants to put on her “jewelry” and she begins to wag her tail in excitement and lets out a gentle bark. This nine-piece holiday bandana set on Amazon ensures that almost every month Maggie has new “jewelry” to wear throughout the year. — Katelyn Gendron, SEO manager 


Casper Memory Foam Dog Bed


$199 $169.15 at Casper






Casper Memory Foam Dog Bed
Stephanie Griffin/CNN



      This is yet another pet product I’ve had since the day we brought Teddy home. I love this dog bed from Casper because it’s two layers of cushiony memory foam, making it the perfect cozy surface for our pup to sleep on all day and night. It’s super easy to clean, thanks to the removable cover (which can be thrown into the washing machine!), and it’s available in three neutral colors and three different sizes. Out of the three beds Teddy has, this is hands down his favorite! — Stephanie Griffin, senior digital content strategist


Litter Genie Ultimate Cat Litter Disposal System


    $20.99 at Target






Litter Genie Ultimate Cat Litter Disposal System
Lindsey Smith/CNN



      I recently bought a Litter Genie for my cat, and it’s the best pet purchase I’ve ever made. It’s basically a Diaper Genie but for cats and completely masks the smell of her waste. We also can’t live without the Paws & Pals brush and Burt’s Bees Dander Reducing Spray for soft and clean fur. — Lindsey Smith, associate editor 


Nina Ottosson by Outward Hound Brick Puzzle Game Dog Toy


$24.99 $14.95 at Amazon






Nina Ottosson by Outward Hound Brick Puzzle Game Dog Toy
Kai Burkhardt/CNN



      We’ve tried giving Miso various puzzle toys since we rescued her because she’s super intelligent and needs to let out a lot of mental energy every day. This one is her favorite, but she’s starting to do it too fast, so we might need to try the next level up soon. In this puzzle, you hide treats in sliding bricks and your dog has to either open the lid of a brick, take it out or slide them all around to reveal their reward. — Kai Burkhardt, associate editor 


Whimzees Dental Treats


$38.99 $34.77 at Amazon






Whimzees Dental Treats
Mike Andronico/CNN



      Maintaining Marie’s oral hygiene has become crucial as she gets older, and given the fact that she’s kind of a maniac, brushing her teeth isn’t exactly easy. Fortunately, Whimzees’ dental treats give me an easy way to keep her bad breath at bay. These chews last a lot longer than other brands I’ve tried and, just as importantly, help keep her occupied when I’m trying to get work done at home. — Mike Andronico, senior tech writer


Tuft + Paw Stellar Cat Bed


    $299 at Tuft + Paw






Tuft + Paw Stellar Cat Bed
Rachel Lubitz/CNN



      Any cat owner knows that the quest to find a stylish cat bed is a long and tiring one. Most look like little fuzzy houses made of plaid or bright florals, and in my tiny studio apartment — for which I’ve handpicked everything to have a certain modern and midcentury yet eclectic vibe — that simply won’t do.
  

      So imagine my glee upon finding this cat oasis that looked straight out of West Elm. For starters, my cat loves the thing. For several hours a day you can find her nestled inside the orb (as I like to call it), with her tiny body a mere black blob on the soft fur cushion inside. Sure, it took her a day to get used to the thing, but nothing that a few sprinkles of catnip couldn’t fix. It honestly brings me so much joy looking at it. There is simply no going back. — Rachel Lubitz, lifestyle editor


West & Willow Custom Pet Portrait


    From $65 at West & Willow






West & Willow Custom Pet Portrait
Stephanie Griffin/CNN



      I’m “that” dog mom who has a literal shrine of her pet throughout her home — and my shrine wouldn’t be complete without this custom pet portrait from one of my favorite pet brands, West & Willow. It’s hanging front and center in my home, and it couldn’t have been easier to order! All you have to do is pick how many pets you want in your photo (you can have up to three), choose a photo and select the size, background and frame color. Every pet parent needs one! — Stephanie Griffin, senior digital content strategist


Ruffwear Highlands Dog Sleeping Bag


    From $99.95 at REI






Ruffwear Highlands Dog Sleeping Bag
Kai Burkhardt/CNN



      We use this sleeping bag whenever we go camping with Miso, but we also keep it out in the house so she has an extra place to lie down and relax. It’s kept her warm on chilly nights in the woods, plus it packs down super small and is even machine-washable. — Kai Burkhardt, associate editor


Wild One Travel Carrier


    $125 at Wild One






Wild One Travel Carrier
Chelsea Stone/CNN



      Taking my cat, Phoebe, on a cross-country flight back home is always a recipe for stress — on my part. (Phoebe is usually fine.) My most recent trip with her was no different: We were delayed for five hours, but the Wild One Travel Carrier ended up being a major lifesaver. While we were stranded in the terminal, I was able to unzip the carrier into a covered cat bed with a comfy cushion to give her room to stretch out and get some air (the interior leash clip came in super handy; I could give her a little freedom to wander without worrying she’d run away). Plus, the plentiful pockets — including the cell phone pocket — made my life easier when it came to keeping her necessities like treats and wipes on hand, while the sleeve fit over my luggage handle to ensure she was secure as I wheeled her along during the journey. — Chelsea Stone, senior commerce editor


West Paw Qwizl Tough Treat-Dispensing Dog Chew Toy


$18.95 From $18.92 at Chewy






West Paw Qwizl Tough Treat-Dispensing Dog Chew Toy
Kai Burkhardt/CNN



      Miso loves this enrichment toy because it’s even harder to get treats out of than the Kong Stuff A Ball. We shove treats inside or even put a bully stick all the way through and she’ll chew and gnaw until we take it away from her or all the snacks are gone. — Kai Burkhardt, associate editor 


Tuft + Paw Vista Perch


    $199 at Tuft + Paw






Tuft + Paw Vista Perch
Chelsea Stone/CNN



      My cat, Phoebe, loves to shadow me while I go about my day, which most of the time is adorable. When I have to work, however, it’s an issue. She especially loves to hop onto my desk and plop herself right between me and my screen in a not-so-subtle plea for attention. In an effort to reclaim my desk space and satisfy my daughter’s need to be involved in my every task, I installed this fluffy yet sleek cat perch from Tuft + Paw on the wall alongside my desk — it didn’t take long and came with easy-to-understand instructions. The Vista allows my feline overlord to comfortably lounge while she supervises my workday, and it’s not an eyesore for me to look at ether. — Chelsea Stone, senior editor


Yeti Trailhead Dog Bed


    $300 at Yeti






Yeti Trailhead Dog Bed
Kai Burkhardt/CNN



      This bed is pricey, but it’s an absolute dream. It’s ultra plush and supportive, giving Miso a comfortable place to lie wherever we put it. Plus, its interior cushion is removable, so we use it as a bed in her crate and leave the exterior section out around the house so she always has two beds to relax in. — Kai Burkhardt, associate editor 


Kalimdor Dog Water Bottle 


    From $10.99 at Amazon






Kalimdor Dog Water Bottle
Stephanie Griffin/CNN



      At this point, I think I have convinced all of our neighbors, friends and literally everyone at our local dog park to buy this water bottle — it’s just that good. First of all, I love it because it holds 19 ounces of water and is leakproof, so I never have to worry about spills in my bag, and it also “re-collects” any remaining water so we never waste a drop. If you frequently go to the dog park, you like to hike with your pet or you’re planning on embarking on a long drive, you need this! — Stephanie Griffin, senior digital content strategist


Tuft + Paw Kip Cat Cushion


    $149 at Tuft + Paw






Tuft + Paw Kip Cat Cushion
Rachel Lubitz/CNN



      My cat is incredibly spoiled. Not only does she have Tuft + Paw’s Stellar Cat Bed, but now she gets to comfortably lounge on this Sherpa cat cushion. After a day of getting used to it, she now curls up in this adorable pouf for at least five hours a day. She looks quite cute in it too. — Rachel Lubitz, lifestyle editor


Little Beast The Love Sweater


    $65 at Little Beast 






Little Beast The Love Sweater
Kai Burkhardt/CNN



      Little Beast has insanely adorable clothes for small and medium dogs (Miso weighs 40 pounds and wears the XL), and we just had to get this one for Valentine’s Day this year. My favorite part of Little Beast sweaters are the little sleeves, because it makes Miso look like she’s a little kid wearing pajamas. — Kai Burkhardt, associate editor 


Hertzko Self-Cleaning Slicker Brush


    $13.99 at Amazon






Hertzko Self-Cleaning Slicker Brush
Chelsea Stone/CNN



      Phoebe is a rare animal that loves being brushed, and she especially loves the very scritchy bristles on this Hertzko brush. Meanwhile, I love how effectively it removes her shedding fur, and how easy it is to clean — you just retract the bristles and throw out the fur clump that remains. — Chelsea Stone, senior commerce editor

This article is a part of CNN Underscored’s Guide to Sleep, a weeklong focus on everything you need to sleep better. We’ll be featuring new products and exclusive deals all week, so check in every morning to see what’s new and be sure to subscribe to the CNN Underscored newsletter to see it all.


      The classic fairy-tale character Sleeping Beauty may be fictional, but the idea of beauty sleep is not. According to New York City-based dermatologist Dr. Hadley King, “Getting little sleep has been shown to negatively affect the skin’s appearance.” She explains that this may be because of the stress hormone cortisol, which has been shown to break down collagen. Lack of sleep stresses the body and “the higher the stress level, the more cortisol is produced, and over time the skin’s ability to rebuild collagen and elastin will decrease,” she says. Beyond this, she notes that sleep is critical for the healing and repair of damaged tissues, skin and mind and body health.
  

      Essentially, poor sleep results in more noticeable signs of aging due to a chain of events that leads to the body’s inability to rebalance its hydration. Your skin becomes more susceptible to puffiness, dryness and more visible wrinkles. “Nighttime is when your skin repairs itself,” says New York City-based dermatologist Dr. Morgan Rabach. “More blood flows to your skin at night, collagen increases and DNA repair helps repair cells that were affected by stressors during that day.”

      So, as our experts describe, if you want the most of your precious beauty sleep, it’s important to reduce stress and cultivate a bedtime beauty routine that can promote the repair of damaged tissues and improve the moisture balance of the skin. “One way to think about it is to protect during the day (sun protection, antioxidants, moisturizer) and repair during the night (retinoids, growth factors, peptides, moisturizer),” says King.
  

      Rabach recommends incorporating antioxidants and retinols into your nightly skin routine. King says that retinol in particular works to increase collagen and pore size and help dead skin turnover.
  

      With all of this in mind, we’ve rounded up some skin care products that you should add to your routine to tackle your skin care concerns overnight. From makeup removers to overnight mask treatments, check out these dermatologist-approved picks to make the most out of your beauty rest.
  

    Makeup removers


Bioderma Sensibio H20 Micellar Water


$14.99 $11.24 at Amazon






Bioderma Sensibio H20 Micellar Water
Amazon



      If you wear makeup, it’s really important to remove it properly before starting your nighttime skin care routine, according to these dermatologists. Just soak a cotton pad with this oil-free micellar water that’s an editor favorite to quickly remove makeup and dirt. Once your skin is dry, proceed with the rest of your routine with ease.
  

Versed Day Dissolve Cleansing Balm


    $17.99 at Versed






Versed Day Dissolve Cleansing Balm
Versed Skin



      This cleansing balm has quickly become one of our favorite skin care products. It melts your makeup right off without stripping your skin of any moisture or leaving your pores feeling clogged. If you’re into double cleansing, Day Dissolve makes a great first step in your routine. Want to buy it now?
  

    Cleansers


CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser


$18.99 $13.59 at Amazon






CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser
Amazon



      CeraVe’s Hydrating Facial Cleanser is the ultimate no-fuss, derm-approved cleansing option. It’s formulated with hyaluronic acid, ceramides and glycerin to remove makeup, dirt and excess oil without drying out your skin. But don’t take our word for it: This all-star has over 57,000 5-star reviews on Amazon to vouch for its efficacy.
  

Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser


    $18 at Glossier






Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser
Glossier



      We’d pick Glossier’s Milky Jelly Cleanser again and again. It’s gentle and super creamy, which makes it good for most skin types and a great cleansing option no matter what the next steps in your routine are.
  

    Face masks


Tata Harper Superkind Radiance Mask


    $65 at Tata Harper






Tata Harper Radiance Mask
Tata Harper



      This gentle AHA mask is fragrance- and gluten-free, so it’s safe for even the most sensitive skin. Dermatologist-tested and hypoallergenic, the formula delicately refines the complexion and nixes dullness while simultaneously hydrating with glycerine. Because of its exfoliating properties, it’s best to apply at night to avoid sensitizing the skin, and always remember to use SPF to protect your new baby-soft face the next day.
  

Loops Beauty Night Shift Masks, 5-Pack


    $35 at Revolve






Loops Beauty Night Shift Masks, 5-Pack
Revolve



      If Loops face masks are good enough for model and swimwear designer Emily Ratajkowski, it’s good enough for us, right? Jokes aside, we really do love these cruelty-free, jellylike masks, especially Night Shift. It’s formulated with allantoin, collagen and nutrient-rich cactus extract to hydrate, repair and replenish the skin before bed.
  

    Serums


Ole Henriksen Glow Cycle Retin-ALT Power Serum


    $60 at Sephora






Olehenriksen Glow Cycle Retin-ALT Power Serum
Sephora



      For a nighttime retinol-like serum, the Ole Henriksen Glow Cycle Power Serum is a good choice. However, this uses bakuchiol, which is a plant-based retinol alternative, to fight signs of aging. Reviewers love its lightweight, silky texture and how it made their skin glow like never before.
  

Estée Lauder Advanced Night Repair Synchronized Multi-Recovery Complex


    $105 at Sephora






Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair Synchronized Multi-Recovery Complex
Sephora



      The Estée Lauder Advanced Night Repair is well loved to reduce signs of aging overnight. Formulated with hyaluronic acid, it’s known to smooth fine lines and reveal more radiant, even-toned skin over time. If you can believe it, one reviewer even said they’d use it until they die.
  

Neutrogena Hydro Boost Night Pressed Face Serum With Hyaluronic Acid


$18.29 $14.50 at Amazon






Neutrogena Hydro Boost Night Pressed Face Serum With Hyaluronic Acid
Amazon



      If you experience dry skin or just want to wake up with ultra plumpness, give the Neutrogena Night Pressed Face Serum a go. Formulated with hyaluronic acid to form a thick, almost creamy consistency, this facial serum seriously melts into the skin to hydrate instantly.
  

    Eye creams


Isdin K-Ox Under-Eye Brightening Cream


    $97 at Amazon






Isdin K-Ox Under-Eye Brightening Cream
Amazon



      Reviewers of the Isdin K-Ox Under-Eye Cream say this is great for eliminating dark circles under the eye. It’s dermatologist-approved too. Rabach recommends this for your bedtime beauty routine. If you’ve been trying to combat dark circles and puffiness, this brightening cream might be worth the splurge.
  

RoC Retinol Correxion Eye Cream


    $22.99 at Target






RoC Retinol Correxion Eye Cream
Target



      An eye cream with retinol? Say no more! With nearly 3,000 5-star ratings at Target, this formula by RoC clearly works well to make your eyes look younger by helping reduce dark circles.
  

First Aid Beauty FAB Skin Lab Retinol Eye Cream


    $44 at Sephora






First Aid Beauty FAB Skin Lab Retinol Eye Cream
Amazon



      We love First Aid Beauty because it works gently on skin. Not only does this eye cream contain retinol, but it also includes hyaluronic acid and the brand’s skin saver complex (a combination of ingredients like colloidal oatmeal, allantoin, aloe and ceramides) to hydrate, calm and soothe even sensitive skin while fighting signs of aging.
  

    Moisturizers


Murad Retinol Youth Renewal Night Cream


    $84 at Dermstore






Murad Retinol Youth Renewal Night Cream
Dermstore



      Reviewers say that the Murad Retinol Youth Renewal Night Cream was moisturizing and left their skin silky smooth for bed. Formulated with retinol, niacinamide and picolinamide, you can expect this to improve skin’s firmness, radiance and hydration over time.
  

Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Night Face Moisturizer


    $22.99 at Target






Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Night Face Moisturizer
Target



      The Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Moisturizer features hyaluronic acid to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and brighten and rejuvenate your skin. What a steal for less than $20!
  

    Overnight masks


Korres Wild Rose Night-Brightening Sleeping Facial


    $48 at Sephora






Korres Wild Rose Night-Brightening Sleeping Facial
Sephora



      A sleeping facial like this one by Korres sounds dreamy. “With a delicious fragrance and rich texture, this product contains a stabilized form of vitamin C to help diminish discolorations, brighten the complexion and protect the skin from free radicals,” says King. The formula also includes wild rose oil, which reduces redness and works to plump the skin by morning.
  

Versed The Shortcut Overnight Facial Peel


    $19.99 at Versed






Versed The Shortcut Overnight Facial Peel
Versed Skin



      Versed calls this “the shortcut to glowier skin.” It’s a leave-on exfoliating mask that uses a blend of lactic acid, glycolic acid and vitamin A to break down dead skin and brighten your appearance overnight. However, King doesn’t recommend combining retinols with acids, so use this on a night when you aren’t using any retinol products.
  

Fresh Black Tea Firming Overnight Mask


    $94 at Sephora






Fresh Black Tea Firming Overnight Mask
Sephora



      If you’d prefer an overnight mask that’s super gentle, the Fresh Black Tea Firming Mask is intensely moisturizing without any harsh ingredients. Rich in antioxidants from black tea, blackberry leaf and lychee seed extract, this can help improve skin elasticity and suppleness.
  

Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask


    $22 at Sephora






Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask
Sephora



      Not a traditional overnight mask like the others on this list, this cult-favorite lip sleeping mask is known to give you baby-soft lips as you sleep. Available in five flavors, the mask aims to surge moisture into the lips without being sticky and works as a miracle worker to flakiness and dryness.
  

    Face oils


Maya Chia The Straight A, Advanced Gentle Retinol Treatment


    $125 at Free People






Maya Chia The Straight A Serum, Advanced Gentle Retinol Treatment
Free People



      The Maya Chia Straight A Serum “contains retinol, bakuchiol and vitamins C and E, in a base of chia seed and buriti oils, to support the skin barrier and lock in moisture,” which is why it’s King’s pick for overnight face oil. Apply this splurge-worthy oil as the last step in your skin care routine solely at night to nourish your skin, improve the look of fine lines and even reduce hyperpigmentation.
  

PSA Skin Midnight Courage Rosehip & Bakuchiol Retinol Night Oil


    $39 at Asos






PSA Skin Midnight Courage Rosehip & Bakuchiol Retinol Night Oil
PSA Skin



      A wallet-approved face oil? Here you go. We’ve been loving PSA Skin Midnight Courage because it contains retinoid and bakuchiol to help reduce the look of dark spots, even skin tone and deliver intense moisture overnight without blowing the bank.
  

The Feelist Most Wanted Facial Oil


    $98 at The Feelist






The Feelist Most Wanted Facial Oil
The Feelist



      Formulated for acne-prone skin and those who usually avoid face oils, this noncomedogenic face oil nourishes the skin with jojoba, rosehip seed and evening primrose oils. Plus, a boost of broad-spectrum CBD calms and soothes the skin overnight.
  

    Beauty tools


Jenny Patinkin Rose on Rose Face Roller


    $38 at SkinStore






Jenny Patinkin Rose on Rose Face Roller
Revolve



      Jenny Patinkin’s Rose on Rose Face Roller is made of rose quartz to help reduce inflammation and boost circulation, especially after refrigeration. This handmade tool is made in a petite size to effectively roll under eyes, on eyelids or on lips. King recommends gently rolling under the eyes from the midline toward the sides of your face to decrease fluid accumulation.
  

Esarora Ice Roller


    $18.99 at Amazon






Esarora Ice Roller
Amazon



      Looking for a more budget-friendly roller? We’ve been obsessed with the Esaroroa Ice Roller to reduce puffiness, relieve headaches and calm skin. We like to keep it stored in the freezer for whenever we need it.
  

    Sleep accessories


Pure Enrichment MistAire Ultrasonic Cool Mist Humidifier


$39.99 $38.91 at Amazon






Pure Enrichment MistAire Ultrasonic Cool Mist Humidifier
Amazon



      “A humidifier in the bedroom overnight in dry weather is helpful for decreasing the amount of transepidermal water loss,” says King. This basically means that a humidifier like this one, which we named as the best humidifier for bedrooms, helps prevent too much water passively evaporating through the skin barrier. TLDR: You want to surge your skin with as much moisture as possible while you sleep.
  

Lunya Washable Silk Sleep Mask


    $48 at Lunya






Lunya Washable Silk Sleep Mask
Lunya



      If you want a truly luxurious sleep session, give Lunya’s Washable Silk Sleep Mask a try. Available in five colors, it’s made of a plush silk that’ll block out any light (without being too heavy) and even doubles as a headband once you wake up.
  

Bedsure Satin Pillowcase, 2-Pack


    From $7.64 at Amazon






Bedsure Satin Pillowcase, 2-Pack
Amazon



      According to King, most of us have deeper wrinkles on the side of the face we sleep on. Although shocking, this makes total sense. Grab yourself a set of these satin pillowcases (which are a much more budget-friendly alternative to popular silk pillowcases) to prevent sleep creases because the soft material is less likely to crease your skin.
  

      However, King does advise that “the effectiveness of silk for this purpose has not been proven.” Better safe than sorry! Rabach recommends washing your pillowcases twice a week, especially if you have oily or acne-prone skin.
  

Nurse Jamie Beauty Bear Age Defy Memory Foam Pillow


    $79 at Dermstore






Nurse Jamie Beauty Bear Age Defy Memory Foam Pillow
Revolve



      To decrease sleep wrinkles, King also recommends the Nurse Jamie Beauty Bear Age Defy Pillow. It has a “unique U-shape design that cradles the face so that it does not become creased with pressure like a standard pillow.”

The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors. View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN)Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is trying to prove there's truth in the old expression, 'the pen is mightier than the sword.' Or in his case -- the selfie video is mightier than the Russian fighter jet.There's no doubt Ukraine's military is outmatched; it is the David to Russia's Goliath. And yet Zelensky is wielding a modern-day slingshot in the form of social media tools and modern communication skills that are helping him gain an upper hand in what is also a crucial battle: the struggle to control the narrative of war.  Influencing people's perception depends on messages that are simple, memorable and impactful. In Zelensky's communication -- ranging from Twitter posts to media interviews and video addresses to foreign parliaments -- he has checked all three of those boxes. This messaging, in addition to powerfully persuasive optics, will guarantee Zelensky's words have a place in future history books. Though right now, Zelensky is likely less concerned with his legacy and more focused on keeping his citizens alive. It's one thing to arm your soldiers with advanced weaponry -- the importance of which is unquestioned. But it's a gifted leader's responsibility to arm their people with something equally powerful: inspiration, motivation and national pride. The one leader who can bring Americans togetherZelensky appears to be outdueling his Kremlin counterpart in that regard, if intelligence reports citing low morale among Russian troops are true. Indeed retired US military experts have expressed shock over how poorly-trained the Russian soldiers appear to be, while marveling at how determined and spirited the Ukranians are. Read MoreThat imbalance of fighting spirit could be costly to the Russians, if you subscribe to the theory of legendary Second World War General George S. Patton, who said, ""Wars may be fought with weapons, but they are won by men. It is the spirit of men who follow and of the man who leads that gains the victory."" Channeling his inner Winston Churchill during a House of Commons address earlier this month, Zelensky echoed a line from the former British Prime Minister, vowing to fight the Russians ""in the forest, in the fields, on the shores, in the streets."" Churchill used these very lines to lift the spirits and resolve of a war-weary Britain during the darkest hours of the Second World War, when England was believed to be the next Nazi conquest.But the Ukrainian President isn't just repurposing lines from the past. He's also crafting memorable sound bites that seem to rise above the rest of the noise.  For instance, his warning to invading Russian soldiers was meant to underscore that Ukranians are not quitters: ""When you attack us, you will see our faces, not our backs."" This is just one of several powerful oratory techniques Zelensky has frequently employed: using your words to help audiences visualize a successful outcome.  Like Churchill, Zelensky declared to British lawmakers, ""We will not give up, we will not lose."" The Ukrainian president demonstrated a full appreciation for the power of positive thinking, to get buy-in from an entire nation that your campaign is winnable.  There is scientific evidence to back this up. Neuroscientific research has shown a single word has the power to regulate physical and emotional responses.  Positive thoughts and words stimulate specific brain activity that moves people into action. Zelensky seems determined to have his words prompt his people -- and many more across the globe -- into the kind of action that could save his country.Like Franklin Roosevelt, Martin Luther King Jr. and other great orators in history, Zelensky's calls to action use metaphor and powerful imagery, some of which have moved western politicians to tears during his recent speeches.  The conditions are ripe for talking peace. Biden should seize the momentDuring these parliamentary addresses, Zelensky tailors his message to the particular group he's trying to persuade. For instance, when addressing US lawmakers, he conjured up imagery of Mount Rushmore and evoked Martin Luther King, Jr's, ""I Have a Dream"" speech, in stating ""I have a need.""  For good measure, he cited both Pearl Harbor and the 9/11 attacks to heighten his audience's ability to feel his country's pain.  Likewise, to the British Parliament, he quoted Churchill and Shakespeare. And to the Germans, Zelensky made references to the post-Holocaust phrase, ""Never again.""Zelensky has gained the narrative upper hand not just with words, but with optics. The visuals of the two opposing leaders are riddled with contrasts. Zelensky physically stands with his people on the darkened streets of Kyiv in a fatigue-green T-shirt and military-style jacket. He embodies the image of a courageous and defiant rebel who appears as one with the soldiers he's sending into battle.  Putin, on the other hand, is dressed like a politician, isolated at the end of an enormous conference table, or alone in a TV studio recording a taped message.  Zelensky's selfie videos are gritty, modern and real. Putin's appear staged and dated. Perhaps Putin's realization that this stark contrast did not favor him, prompted him to hold a pro-war rally in a crowded stadium (attendance was reportedly mandatory for state employees) to show he had support from the Russian people. But even then, his choice of a puffy, down coat made him look more like a malevolent Michelin Man than an omnipotent leader to be feared.  Putin tried to tear a page out of Zelensky's modern communications playbook by ditching the suit and getting out among the people. But the feeble attempt proved that you can't teach an old bear new tricks. To make matters worse, even the televised feed of Putin's speech abruptly cut out in mid-sentence, due to what was called ""technical difficulties.""History is kind to the brave and courageous, especially when they defy odds that are stacked against them. Zelensky, through his fearless calls to action, is defining his legacy more and more with each passing day, while Putin's exposed weaknesses run counter to the reputation of strength he's worked hard to propagate.  It's difficult to say to what degree Zelensky's gifted communication skills are responsible for the surprising strength of the Ukrainian resistance. But if Churchill's thesis on the power of oratory is correct, then history is likely to assign outsized credit to the role Zelensky's words have played.

He who enjoys it, wields a power more durable than that of a great king."" Or in this case, a dictator.

What my Republican colleagues get so wrong about Florida’s ‘don’t say gay’ bill

Disney CEO sparks controversy by trying to dodge politics







Editor’s Note: Gavin Smith is a public relations professional and political strategist. He is CEO of the Inspyre Group, a public relations and marketing consulting firm in Lexington, South Carolina. During the Trump administration he served as press secretary for the Department of Labor and deputy communications director for the Department of Health and Human Services. The views expressed here are his own. View more opinion on CNN.




CNN
         — 
    


      Being a Republican is becoming harder and harder. From conspiracy theories about stolen elections to being urged by a former colleague in the Trump administration to “repent my gay sins,” I continue to find it harder and harder to relate to the so-called “party of life.” 
  

      As one of the few openly gay officials in Trump’s administration, and a lifelong Republican, I’ve struggled with how to reconcile my differences on LGBTQ+ issues with the political right. I agree with Republicans on most fiscal issues. But, as to how the party treats the LGBTQ+ community, their policies continue to cross the line.

      Case in point: Florida Republican lawmakers’ recent passage of the controversial “Parental Rights in Education” bill. 
  

      Dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill, the legislation bans public schools from teaching students about sexual orientation or gender identity in kindergarten through third grade. Despite not explicitly saying “don’t say gay,” its language, requiring that lessons for older students only be taught in “age appropriate or developmentally appropriate” terms, is argued to be deliberately ambiguous.  What’s more, this criteria is a mechanism for prohibiting open discussions of LGBTQ+ people, families and issues. 
  

      Proponents of this bill, and of the 15 other bills similar in nature being considered in nine states across the country, routinely claim school districts and educators are infringing on parental rights and “sexualizing school aged children,” and argue such conversations should be led by parents rather than educators. 
  

      These claims, at face value, aren’t entirely invalid. Parents absolutely should play an important role in having these conversations with their children. 
  

      However, despite the important role parents play, it is blatantly wrong and hypocritical of Republicans to assert that legislation is needed to help protect America’s youth from so-called “sexualization” in our public schools.
  

      In fact, the reality is, whether it be love stories between male and female characters in assigned readings, or lesson plans that teach foreign languages through illustrations of traditional households, students are exposed to hetero-sexualism each and every day. Republicans aren’t outraged by this and bills aren’t being introduced to strip classrooms of these materials.
  

      Instead, the Republican claim of protecting children is nothing more than a guise to distract the public while far-right Republicans accomplish their true objective of restricting conversations around homo-sexualism and other sexual orientations and gender identities to which they object.

Florida and Texas can't outlaw my family




      Further, as a byproduct of their asinine policies, far-right Republicans also claim that discussions of LGBTQ+ related topics don’t belong in the classroom. From book bans to disbanding gay-straight alliance clubs, these very actions and ideals are ludicrous and discriminatory. 
  

      America’s classrooms are important spaces where topics such as civil rights and social studies are taught. Members of the LGBTQ+ community have played important roles in both American and international history, and LGBTQ+ students equally deserve to see their own history and experiences reflected in their learning environment. 
  

      Whether it be learning about the Stonewall riots in New York in 1969 or Obergefell v. Hodges, which resulted in the Supreme Court ruling in favor of same-sex marriage nationwide, these students should be afforded the opportunity to learn alongside their peers in an environment where they can be proud of who they are. Students across the country shouldn’t learn in an environment where they feel as if their mere existence or the discussion of their sexual or gender identity is somehow criminal by nature.
  

      Finally, schools are supposed to be a place where we send our children to be educated and prepared for the real world. If that truly is the case, and we’re serious about educating world class leaders, cleansing academic environments of LGBTQ+ related materials and mentions isn’t preparing our youth for that charge. 
  

      At the end of the day, this isn’t a winning strategy for Republicans either. These pieces of legislation are blatantly discriminatory and wrong on all accounts, as evidenced by a recent Gallup poll. 


      In fact, support for LGBTQ+ people and their rights has reached an all-time high among Republicans. Specifically, Gallup found that 55% of individuals who identify as a Republican support same-sex marriage. This is the highest level of Republican support for same-sex marriage recorded since Gallup began measuring this sentiment in 1997.

      Let’s be real; contrary to the claims of far-right Republican lawmakers, there isn’t some mass conspiracy of teachers trying to “groom” students into being gay. Being gay isn’t a choice and Republicans know that. 
  

      Instead, this whole charade is nothing more than another attempt by far-right Republicans to fuel a political divide at the expense of yet another marginalized community, all while pushing an antiquated political agenda. 
  

      And for that reason, as a proud member of the LGBTQ+ community, I urge my fellow Republicans to stand up, show respect for every American, and stop legislating asinine policies for problems that simply do not exist.

What Ketanji Brown Jackson's hearing revealsUpdated 3:47 PM ET, Mon March 21, 2022 JUST WATCHEDWhy Ketanji Brown Jackson's Supreme Court confirmation hearing is significantReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhy Ketanji Brown Jackson's Supreme Court confirmation hearing is significant 02:57 (CNN)CNN Opinion contributors share their tweets on the first day of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's Supreme Court confirmation hearing.Watching  #KetanjiBrownJackson confirmation hearing for the #SupremeCourt feels surreal. It's not anything I ever imagined I'd see in my lifetime--Not because there aren't many qualified Black women for the court, but because sexism & racism work so hard to diminish our dreams.— RoxanneJones (@iamroxannejones) March 21, 2022

Even a few minutes into her opening statement, Judge Jackson already is displaying qualities and a personal story that will make her a difficult person to demonize.— David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) March 21, 2022

There's no question - #KetanjiBrownJackson is a woman of great accomplishment, grace, and gratitude. All important qualities for #SupremeCourt— Alice Stewart (@alicetweet) March 21, 2022

GOP Judge Tom Griffiths introducing #JudgeKetanjiBrownJackson gives her bipartisan cred. Her endorsement by @GLFOP (Fraternal Order of Police) negates potential attacks on crime. And her opening statement is personal, patriotic, powerful. Impressive first day so far.— Paul Begala (@PaulBegala) March 21, 2022

Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson just spoke to every working parent in the world today when she acknowledged how hard it can be at times to balance her professional career with parenting, and admitted: ""I didn't always get that balance right."" 💯— Laura Coates (@thelauracoates) March 21, 2022

Excellent and effective opening statement by KBJ--even if, or should I say especially because, it repudiates Left's view of judging.— Ed Whelan (@EdWhelanEPPC) March 21, 2022

History is being made: #JudgeKetanjiBrownJackson is so incredibly impressive. I'm in awe.— Kirsten Powers (@KirstenPowers) March 21, 2022

♥️Black women get nowhere without a tribe of other Black women lifting us up. I so appreciate Professor Lisa Fairfax, #KetanjiBrownJackson's former college roommate, introducing her sis for the nation's highest court. That is #BlackGirlLove #SupremeCourtHearing— RoxanneJones (@iamroxannejones) March 21, 2022

Smart to have a retired a Republican-appointed  appellate court judge introduce Judge Jackson but I wonder how it landed w/Rs on the panel when he warned about the challenges to democracy and the rule of law from ""autocrats"" and their followers, abroad and here at home.— David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) March 21, 2022

Marsha Blackburn is giving the purest distillation of conservative attacks on Jackson (plus a preview of the 2022 midterm arguments). Everything from the 1619 Project to trans athletes.— Nicole Hemmer (@pastpunditry) March 21, 2022

The statements of Sens. #Hawley and #Blackburn  show how the QAnon obsession with fake pedophilia accusations has entered the Republican mainstream.— Jeffrey Toobin (@JeffreyToobin) March 21, 2022

A red flag should pop up on screen for every false claim Sen. Marsha Blackburn makes about #KetanjiBrownJackson.— Natasha S. Alford (@NatashaSAlford) March 21, 2022

Opening day of KBJ hearing is just another reminder of how decisive Senate majority is on SCOTUS nominations. Whole dynamic would be very different if Trump hadn't thrown away Senate seats from Georgia.— Ed Whelan (@EdWhelanEPPC) March 21, 2022

Supreme Court justices have zero say on expanding the size of the Court. That's entirely up to Congress and the President.— Elie Honig (@eliehonig) March 21, 2022

Private meetings between #KetanjiBrownJackson & Senators appear to have helped lower the temperature in #SupremeCourt confirmation hearing.  Speaks volumes for her.— Alice Stewart (@alicetweet) March 21, 2022

Not to be outdone, @SenTomCotton opens up with right-wing sheet music on the border, critical race theory, ""catch and release"" prosecutors and more.  Every one of them competing for a few seconds on Fox tonight.— David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) March 21, 2022

Breaktime on #KetanjiBrownJackson hearingsMy quick take so far:Republicans spent more time on Kavanaugh and Thomas than #KBJ (note there will be no beer ?s)Democrats sing #KBJ praises, linking her legacy to #RBG, Motley (confident this will be her 4th confirmation)— Professor Renee Knake Jefferson (@reneeknake) March 21, 2022

Hawley goes right into his accusations that Jackson is ""soft on child pornographers,"" a Pizzagate/QAnon dogwhistle (and a sign of how much those conspiracies are seeping into the GOP).— Nicole Hemmer (@pastpunditry) March 21, 2022

Sen Sasse also complaining about Kavanaugh and other R hearings and says that SCOTUS reaches beyond its constitutional purpose, but is more even-handed in blaming a broader problem involving all three branches and both parties going back decades. He's one of the reasonable ones.— Jennifer Rodgers (@JenGRodgers) March 21, 2022

If KBJ is going to be held accountable for statements made by outside groups supporting the nomination, every Senator should be confronted with statements made by donors, and asked if they agree.Starting with any Senators who have received donations from January 6 protestors— Elliot Williams (@elliotcwilliams) March 21, 2022

Nice to see Democrats embracing Judge Jackson's prior experience as a public defender.  Blumenthal's discussion of the role of public defenders from a prosecutor's perspective (""my greatest fear as a prosecutor was seeing defendants representing themselves"") is key here.— Democracy is in Trouble 💚💕 (@ProfTolson) March 21, 2022

Sen Cruz gives a false history lesson: it's the Dems fault that SCOTUS is now political. Effectively admits that it's about politics, but the Ds started it. Cruz hold the distinction of saying the most juvenile things with the most adult words of anyone in the Republican Party.— Jennifer Rodgers (@JenGRodgers) March 21, 2022

.@SenTedCruz, the first of the '24 hopefuls to speak, makes the most nakedly partisan opening remarks- enough red meat that Lipator may be needed. Multiple shots at @JoeBiden; Ted Kennedy & Ds. Invocations of Bork; Thomas & Kavanaugh hearings; guns, abortion & softies on bench!— David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) March 21, 2022

Klobuchar points out, Judge Jackson's parents once attended segregated schools and became school teachers. #KetanjiBrownJackson more than knows the definition of humble beginnings, despite criticism that she's too elite as a double Harvard grad. (The one time it's a problem btw)— Natasha S. Alford (@NatashaSAlford) March 21, 2022

Ah, now Sen. Lee is getting to the point. After lots of philosophy, and even a little Greek mythology, Lee brings it around to the legitimacy of the court and therefore .... court packing. Lee hasn't raised an issue about her experience, but expect questions to her about this.— Jennifer Rodgers (@JenGRodgers) March 21, 2022

Note Cornyn's use of words like ""advocacy"" to suggest #KetanjiBrownJackson is not an impartial judge even as he says he respects her accomplishments.— Natasha S. Alford (@NatashaSAlford) March 21, 2022

Dianne Feinstein says, ""The Supreme Court is not a political institution."" It's an aspirational statement, not an accurate description.— Nicole Hemmer (@pastpunditry) March 21, 2022

.@LindseyGrahamSC going in on the fact that KBJ is supported by the ""radical left"" (?) and that his preferred pick, Michelle Childs, would not have been.Someone should tell him that Childs would have gotten the same support. He's making up an excuse for not supporting KBJ.— Elliot Williams (@elliotcwilliams) March 21, 2022

.@senleahy speaks to his 20 SCOTUS confirmation hearings and the bipartisan nature of many of those votes.  But he is looking back at septia-toned memories.  This has become a highly partisan process.— David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) March 21, 2022

Graham, seen as a potential ""yes"" vote because of positive vote in prior confirmations, uses his opening comments to lay the groundwork for a ""no"" vote. ""This is going to be about philosophy rather than the historic nature of the pic."" Endorses Hawley's meritless attacks. Yikes— Democracy is in Trouble 💚💕 (@ProfTolson) March 21, 2022

Lindsey Graham really brought his whole box of grievances to the hearings today.— Nicole Hemmer (@pastpunditry) March 21, 2022

Respectful start to #KetanjiBrownJackson #SCOTUS confirmation hearings by @ChuckGrassley - saying he will look at her ""record, views on the law, and judicial philosophy.""— Alice Stewart (@alicetweet) March 21, 2022

Grassley seems to be splitting hairs between attorneys who represent accused criminals by court appointment and criminal defense attorneys who, he says, want to undermine the law.— David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) March 21, 2022

Public defenders are not soft on crime. They are tough on injustice. That should be the philosophy of every Judge.— Laura Coates (@thelauracoates) March 21, 2022

Already addressing the ""soft on crime"" attacks because we know regardless of #KetanjiBrownJackson being endorsed by the National Fraternal Order of Police, her positions will be misrepresented.— Natasha S. Alford (@NatashaSAlford) March 21, 2022

Away we go ... Jackson hearing starts with the stmt of Sen. Durbin reminding everyone of this historic nomination, calling it a proud day for America. Indeed. These opening stmts will tell us what Qs will be asked, esp by Rs.— Jennifer Rodgers (@JenGRodgers) March 21, 2022

I hope this doesn't need to be said, but I'll say it anyway (as a longtime prosecutor): Any person who zealously represents criminal defendants does a vital constitutional duty. Such service is crucial to our democracy and a credit to any lawyer's record.— Elie Honig (@eliehonig) March 21, 2022

It will be so telling if / when Republicans go after Judge Jackson for being a public defender. The right to legal representation in criminal cases is one of the most admirable parts of our justice system. Her work represents the best of America. Pathetic to see that attacked.— Jill Filipovic (@JillFilipovic) March 21, 2022

CNN,What's next for the batsuit?,I,"What's next for the batsuit? - CNN StyleFeature · fashionWhat's next for the batsuit?Adding to a franchise with over 80 years worth of material was at times daunting, according to ""The Batman"" costume designers Glyn Dillon and David Crossman. By Leah Dolan, CNN Contributors: Brook Joyner, CNNUpdated 15th March 2022When costume designer Glyn Dillon got a call asking if he'd be interested in working on Matt Reeves' newly-released movie ""The Batman,"" the first thing he sketched was a pair of ears. ""How big are the ears?"" he remembered worrying about. ""For some reason, it's a big deal with all the fans,"" he said over Zoom.From Adam West and Michael Keaton to George Clooney and Christian Bale -- and now Robert Pattinson -- each version of the Caped Crusader becomes the measure for a new generation of viewers. But perhaps nothing cements the reputation of Batman more than his batsuit. Christian Bale in ""Batman Begins"" (2005). Credit: Warner Bros/DC Comics/Kobal/ShutterstockThere was the now-infamous nipple-clad muscle number signed off by director Joel Schumacher for ""Batman Forever"" (1995) and ""Batman & Robin"" (1997), the misshapen mask and demonically out-turned ears in the 1943 television serial or the extra-bulky batsuit Ben Affleck wore in Zack Snyder's 2016 version. Yet despite every modification, failed and successful, the historic costume still holds an undeniable kind of power. ""As soon as you put on the suit,"" Pattinson told GQ magazine in the run-up to the film's release, ""it sort of does something to you. You start behaving in this quite particular way.""Val Kilmer in ""Batman Forever"" (1995) had bat-nipples on his costume.  Credit: Moviestore/ShutterstockAs did George Clooney's in ""Batman & Robin"" (1997).  Credit: Prod DB/Warner-DC Comics/Alamy Stock PhotoBen Affleck's chunky batsuit  in ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" (2016) was a departure from the sleek, leaner costumes that came before. Credit: Warner Bros/DC Comics/Kobal/ShutterstockAnd the story of this batsuit already stands apart from the rest, due to an unwavering focus on realism. It's the handiwork of Glyn Dillon and Dave Crossman -- longtime colleagues that have worked together on Star Wars movies ""Rogue One"" (2016) and ""Solo"" (2018) -- as well as acclaimed costume designer Jacqueline Durran -- who won an Oscar for her work outfitting the cast of  ""Little Women"" (2019).""The Batman"" director Matt Reeves envisioned a more realistic batsuit. Credit: Warner Bros.""This is the most based-in-reality the Batsuit can be,"" said Crossman on the same call, ""we removed a lot of the fantasy element.""Inspired by Martin Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"" (1976), and borrowing heavily from the film noir genre, director Matt Reeves was keen to forge a more realistic version of damaged millionaire Bruce Wayne for his film. Still marred by the murder of both his parents, a young Wayne is grappling with his new life as a masked vigilante in Gotham City  -- fighting organized crime and villain The Riddler.His suit is built in tandem with this tale: An angry, inexperienced outsider trying to right the wrongs of the world himself. Homespun and amateurish, this Batsuit is covered in visible topstitching and exposed zippers. ""We wanted it to feel real,"" said Dillon. ""That was one of the things we were thinking about. Like, 'well if you really had (the batsuit) you would have a fly and you'd be able to put it on quite easily.'"" There is visible topstitching across Pattinson's cowl to create a lived-in feel. Credit: Warner Bros.The ballistic-looking bodysuit is modeled after both the texture and movement of a bullet proof vest, along with a cop-inspired utility belt. ""It definitely looks like he's nicked stuff from the police department,"" chuckled Dillon. In the true style of Travis Bickle, Scorsese's psychologically disturbed protagonist, Wayne even fashions a pair of quick-draw gun holsters to hide in his wrist.Pattinson's suit is inspired by police equipment like bullet proof vests. Credit: Warner Bros.Even the cowl, Batman's signature molded mask, imitates the appearance of leather panels hand-stitched together. ""No one's ever done that kind of thing before,"" Dillon noted, of its DIY-feel. Its surface is flecked with bullet grazes and indents, telling a story of previous close calls, said Crossman. The sculpted, furrowed brow typical of earlier masks has been replaced with a more neutral expression, too, helping Batman blend in better when moonlighting as a detective. It's cut sharply just under the cheekbones, Crossman points out, much like the original comic book depictions. ""And we couldn't cover up his jaw,"" interjects Dillon. ""(Pattinson's) got an amazing jaw.""The mask is cut at Pattinson's cheekbones, a detail that featured in the comic books of Frank Miller. Credit: Jonathan Olley/© 2020 Warner Bros.Inherited traitsAs unique as this batsuit might be, no man is an island -- and no version of Batman is created in a vacuum. Operating within a franchise that has over 80 years worth of material to draw from was both a help and a hindrance, according to Dillon and Crossman. Research, however, was straightforward enough: ""He's such an iconic character, you just know about the usual gear. It was more a case of 'What did we like?'"" Dillon recalled. They decided to recreate the gray of Adam West's 1960's batsuit, a color which reappeared later in Frank Miller's 1987 landmark comic story arc ""Batman: Year One,"" (another key text for Reeves). ""You've got the gray suit and the black cape,"" said Crossman. ""So you have this nice contrast between the two things. He's not another black blob.""The new batsuit is gray instead of black, with a small yellow detail on the sleeve. Credit: Jonathan Olley/© 2020 Warner Bros.Taking inspiration from Adam West's costume in the ""Batman"" television series (1966-1968).  Credit: Fox/Abc/Kobal/ShutterstockCrossman and Dillon have also reintroduced the iconic yellow accent, a feature that has been missing since 1997's ""Batman & Robin,"" albeit subtly. ""We have this tiny, tiny, little bit of webbing on the sleeve, with a bit of yellow on there,"" Dillon explained. ""It's nice to bring it back.""But the enormity of the franchise, and its fanbase, sometimes felt overwhelming -- where considering the fans could quickly become ""paralyzing,"" Dillon admitted.""There's too many opposing factions,"" he continued. ""People are married to the idea that (one subjective portrayal) is the only true Batman.""The evolution of the batsuitSince the very first Batman story appeared in a 1939 issue of ""Detective Comics,"" the suit has evolved from a camp and colorful garb into something distinctly militaristic. ""The batsuit itself has definitely become more intricate,"" said comic book author and Batman chronicler, Matthew K. Manning, over video call. ""Now, the suit is more like a piece of armor all pieced together. When (in older adaptations) it was really just tights.""Larger production budgets and better access to more sophisticated materials has of course impacted the costume's trajectory, according to Crossman. ""Some of it is led by what you can actually achieve at the time,"" he said. ""If you look at the earliest (cinematic) Batman, you can see the fabric is sagging, but by the time Adam West comes along, fabrics are slightly improving.""Tim Burton's 1989 film version was the first to create a contoured cowl for Michael Keaton; using black foam latex instead of the ill-fitting spandex or high-sheen satin used in previous films. ""As time goes on, all these techniques get better. Especially with computer work,"" said Crossman. ""Now, you can model things on the computer so you can make them a lot more wearable and enable your head to move."" The cowl worn by in Michael Keaton in ""Batman"" (1989) was the first all-in-one molded mask. Credit: Moviestore/ShutterstockWhile the days of a lycra-clad Batman feel long gone, Manning believes audiences still deserve a higher dose of fantasy on their screens."" (Filmmakers) really can't get away from armor (muscle suit) for the mass audience,"" he said. ""There is an obsession with making things utilitarian. I don't know if (the industry) just doesn't trust modern audiences with fantasy. That said, I haven't seen fans as excited for a Batman movie since Christopher Nolan. So they might be going in the right direction here.""Johnny Duncan and Robert Lowery in ""Batman and Robin"" (1949). Materials at this point were prone to stretching and sagging. Credit: AF archive/Alamy Stock PhotoCostume materials had improved slightly by the time it was Adam West's era for the TV series ""Batman"" circa 1966.

Every Prequel, Sequel, and Remake Coming in 2022Every movie made these days is a prequel, sequel, remake, reboot, soft reboot, or spin-off of some sort.Every Prequel, Sequel, and Remake Coming in 2022They say there's no originality left in Hollywood. They say every movie made these days is a prequel, sequel, remake, reboot, soft reboot, or spin-off of some sort. And they're right. Here's proof...'Avatar 2'Directed by: James CameronStarring: Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, Kate Winslet, Vin Diesel, Michelle Yeoh, Giovanni Ribisi, Stephen Lang, Cliff Curtis, Edie Falco, Brendan Cowell, Jemaine Clement, Oona ChaplinRelease date: December 16, 2022About 'Avatar 2'Shooting has wrapped on Avatar 2 after three years in production. Covid scuttled some plans but James Cameron's latest blockbuster should arrive late this year. All of the original cast is back, as well as new additions Kate Winslet, Cliff Curtis, Edie Falco, Brendan Cowell, Michelle Yeoh, Jemaine Clement, Oona Chaplin, Vin Diesel, and CJ Jones. The story will pick up years later with Jake Sully and Neytiri having started a family on Pandora. But humans return and a new war begins.Watch a Trailer for 'Avatar 2''Jurassic World: Dominion'Directed by: Colin TrevorrowStarring: Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Laura Dern, Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum, Justice Smith, Daniella Pineda, Omar Sy, BD WongRelease date: June 10, 2022About 'Jurassic World: Dominion'Dinosaurs are loose in the world now so anyting goes in the newest Jurassic Park franchise installment, Dominion, coming this summer. Production was stalled due to COVID but shooting resumed last July and things are currently on track for 2022. Jurassic World: Dominion is the sixth film in the franchise and set four years after the events of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. It will complete the ""World"" trilogy.Watch a Trailer for 'Jurassic World: Dominion''Top Gun: Maverick'Directed by: Joseph KosinskiStarring: Tom Cruise, Miles Teller, Jennifer Connelly, Jon Hamm, Val Kilmer, Jay Ellis, Monica BarbaroRelease date: May 27, 2022About 'Top Gun: Maverick'Tom Cruise returns more than 30 years later to reprise his most famous role as Maverick in the new Top Gun sequel. We wouldn't care except... This is a Tom Cruise movie and the action sequences alone will be worth the price of admission. Hopefully. The trailer provides glimpses. Maverick is still flying as the movie begins, and he's assigned a new group to train that includes his old friend Goose's son, Rooster (Teller). Expect a monster box office performance for this one, and familiar faces, old and new.Watch a Trailer for 'Top Gun: Maverick''Mission: Impossible 7'Directed by: Christopher McQuarrieStarring: Tom Cruise, Hayley Atwell, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby, Pom Klementieff, Shea Whigham, Esai Morales, Rob Delaney, Charles Parnell, Indira Varma, Mark Gatiss, Cary ElwesRelease date: September 7, 2022About 'Mission: Impossible 7'It's going to be a big year for Tom Cruise in 2022 with both Top Gun: Maverick and the seventh Mission: Impossible movie on the docket. We don't have any real details on M:I7 aside from the fact Christopher McQuarrie will return to write and direct as he's done in the last two (and best) installments. This franchise is all about oneupmanship stuntwise. Expect Cruise to top the last film, Fallout, when he went skydiving from the upper stratosphere.Trailer N/A'Thor: Love and Thunder'Directed by: Taika WaititiStarring: Chris Hemsworth, Tessa Thompson, Natalie Portman, Christian Bale, Chris Pratt, Dave Bautista, Karen Gillan, Pom Klementieff, Vin Diesel, Jeff Goldblum, Jaimie Alexander, Sean GunnRelease date: July 8, 2022About 'Thor: Love and Thunder'Thor: Ragnarok director and inarguable genius Taika Waititi returns to helm the fourth Thor movie, in 2022. Chris Hemsworth will return as well, of course, in the hulking title role. Thor will be joined by the Guardians of the Galaxy, but expect the story to focus more on his relationship with Jane Foster (Portman). She's expected to lift Mjolnir and become Lady Thor while also battling cancer. Plus, look for Valkyrie, Queen of New Asgard and the MCU's first major LGBTQ character, to find love, as well (perhaps with Sif?).Watch a Trailer for 'Thor: Love and Thunder''Black Panther: Wakanda Forever'Directed by: Ryan CooglerStarring: Letitia Wright, Danai Gurira, Lupita Nyong’o, Angela Bassett, Winston Duke, Martin FreemanRelease date: November 11, 2022About 'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever'How the Black Panther franchise moves on after the crushing death of star Chadwick Boseman remains to be seen. But it will move on. Director Ryan Coogler is back for the sequel, coming in Fall 2022. Disney has said Boseman, and thus T'Challa, will not appear. And the new film ""will explore the world of Wakanda and the rich characters introduced in the first film."" Not much to go on. We're hoping for a Nakia-centered story.Watch a Trailer for 'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever''Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness'Directed by: Sam RaimiStarring: Benedict Cumberbatch, Elizabeth Olsen, Benedict Wong, Rachel McAdams, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Xochitl GomezRelease date: May 6, 2022About 'Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness'Doctor Strange director Scott Derrickson announced at Comic-Con 2019 he was going to make ""the first scary MCU film"" with this sequel, but he's been replaced by Sam Raimi. That means interesting things, like — expect any horror to be tinged with comedy... The story will pick up after the events of Loki Season 1 and Spider-Man: No Way Home. Dr. Strange (Cumberbatch) opens the door to the multiverse and unleashes a bizarro version of himself who becomes all-powerful. Wanda Maximoff will appear to lend a hand but she may not be enough.Watch a Teaser for 'Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness''The Batman'Directed by: Matt ReevesStarring: Robert Pattinson, Zoë Kravitz, Paul Dano, Jeffrey Wright, John Turturro, Peter Sarsgaard, Andy Serkis, Colin Farrell, Barry KeoghanRelease date: March 4, 2022About 'The Batman'The long-awaited Batman reboot lands in March. Originally planned for a summer 2021 debut, The Batman was one of many Covid casualties. This new version introduces the youngest Bruce Wayne yet. Robert Pattinson takes over in the Dark Knight's second year of fighting crime in Gotham City. And he'll face a rogue's gallery in what's expected to be the first of a trilogy (as well as two spin-off TV series). The Riddler (Dano) will test Batman's brains, while the Penguin (Farrell) goes for his heart. Catwoman (Kravitz) will also appear as a new ally for the Caped Crusader.Watch a Teaser for 'The Batman''The Flash'Directed by: Andy MuschiettiStarring: Ezra Miller, Kiersey Clemons, Ben Affleck, Sasha Calle, Michael Keaton, Ron Livingston, Michael Shannon, Antje Traue, Maribel Verdú, Saoirse-Monica Jackson, Rudy MancusoRelease date: November 4, 2022About 'The Flash'It'll be a big year for the DC Extended Universe with both Flash and Aquaman movies on the way. The Flash will put Ezra Miller's Barry Allen front and center in a story that sees the metahuman travel back in time to stop his mother's murder. The decision costs him in the present, however.The Flash will also feature old friends Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne and Michael Shannon as General Zod, who was killed by Superman in Man of Steel. Both will probably appear in the past. The movie will also introduce Sasha Calle as Supergirl, Superman's cousin. We'll see how she fits into the overall Justice League scheme, but it's cool to see the Universe expanding.Watch a Teaser for 'The Flash''Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom'Directed by: James WanStarring: Jason Momoa, Amber Heard, Patrick Wilson, Nicole Kidman, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Temuera Morrison, Pilou AsbækRelease date: December 16, 2022About 'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom'The Aquaman sequel is coming in time for Christmas 2022. Plot details are unknown but Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom will be based on Silver Age Aquaman with Black Manta (Abdul-Mateen) as a main villain. Director James Wan has also stressed the importance of world-building so look for new underwater kingdoms to premiere, as well as more of ""The Trench."" Momoa also debuted Aquaman's new, more classic look on Instagram last year.Watch a Behind the Scenes Look at 'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom''Black Adam'Directed by: Jaume Collet-SerraStarring: Dwayne Johnson, Noah Centineo, Aldis Hodge, Sarah Shahi, Quintessa Swindell, Pierce BrosnanRelease date: July 29, 2022About 'Black Adam'Dwayne Johnson will finally appear as a comic superhero (a seeming inevitability) in 2022. Johnson will take the lead in Black Adam, which will tell the story of the title antihero. Black Adam is an antagonist to Shazam in the DC Comics universe and this new film will act as a spin-off of the 2019 movie. Black Adam has been imprisoned for 5,000 years but he's getting out, and looking to vent.Watch a Teaser for 'Black Adam''Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse - Part One'Directed by: Joaquim Dos SantosStarring: Shameik Moore, Oscar Isaac, Hailee Steinfeld, Jake Johnson, Issa RaeRelease date: October 7, 2022About 'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse - Part One'The sequel to 2018's animated spectacular Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is on tap for October 2022. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse - Part One (Part Two will arrive in 2023) continues the development of Miles Morales as the Web Slinger, as well as the expansion of the multiverse where new Spideys — Spider-Man 2099, Spider-Woman, Japanese Spidey — will arrive. Plus, we may see animated versions of the characters from the MCU. Plot-wise, Across the Spider-Verse begins with Gwen visiting Miles and taking him on a new adventure that'll lead to a classic villain.Watch a First Look at 'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse - Part One''Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore'Directed by: David YatesStarring: Eddie Redmayne, Jude Law, Katherine Waterston, Ezra Miller, Mads Mikkelsen, Dan Fogler, Alison SudolRelease date: April 15, 2022About 'Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore'A third Fantastic Beasts film is on the way despite the poor reception that greeted the second one. Hopefully, the Wizarding World can redeem itself. J.K. Rowling is a co-writer and she's got a familiar cast returning, always a reassuring thing. The Secrets of Dumbledore will be set in the '30s where a magical war is brewing alongside World War II. Grindelwald's (Mads Mikkelsen takes over for Johnny Depp) power is growing and Dumbledore (Law) gives Newt Scamander and his friends an important mission.Watch a Trailer for 'Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore''Disenchanted'Director: Adam ShankmanStarring: Amy Adams, Patrick Dempsey, James Marsden, Idina Menzel, Gabriella Baldacchino, Maya Rudolph, Yvette Nicole Brown, Jayma Mays, Oscar NunezRelease date: TBA 2022About 'Disenchanted'In 2007, Enchanted became a surprise hit. The live-action/animated musical fantasy romantic comedy combined many genres to create a crowd-pleasing story full of all the great stuff from fairy tales with some modern flourishes.Disenchanted, the Enchanted sequel, has been in the works for over a decade. Disney just couldn't get the story right, despite multiple screenwriters. Reportedly, it was the work of Brigitte Hales, the newest writer on the project, that got the sequel greenlit after 14 years. It'll premiere on Disney+ in 2022. Here's the story synopsis, per the DisInsider:""The film will see Giselle, Robert, and Morgan moving to a new house in the suburbs, overseen by Malvina Monroe, the main villain of the film. After problems begin to arise, Giselle makes a wish to transform their lives into a perfect fairytale. However, the spell backfires dramatically and puts Giselle in a rush against the clock to save both her family and her Kingdom of Andalasia before the clock strikes midnight.""Watch a First Look at 'Disenchanted''Hocus Pocus 2'Directed by: Anne FletcherStarring: Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, Kathy Najimy, Doug Jones, Whitney Peak, Lilia Buckingham, Tony Hale, Sam Richardson, Hannah WaddinghamRelease date: TBA 2022About 'Hocus Pocus 2'Like Enchanted, Hocus Pocus will also be getting a Disney+ sequel in 2022. The original cast is all back to play the Sanderson sisters once more. The three witches are summoned to modern-day Salem again, nearly 30 years after the events of the first film. Shooting just began in Boston in December so the movie appears to be on track.Watch a First Look at 'Hocus Pocus 2''Knives Out 2'Directed by: Rian JohnsonStarring: Daniel Craig, Dave Bautista, Edward Norton, Janelle Monáe, Kathryn Hahn, Leslie Odom Jr., Kate Hudson, Madelyn Cline, Jessica Henwick, Ethan HawkeRelease date: TBA 2022About 'Knives Out 2'The first of two Benoit Blanc sequels Rian Johnson has planned for Netflix, Knives Out 2 (working title) will return the genius detective played by Daniel Craig to take on a new case with a new ensemble of star suspects. It looks like the streamer has a Hercule Poirot-style plan for Johnson's characters.'Creed III'Director: Michael B. JordanStarring: Michael B. Jordan, Deontay Wilder (rumored)Release date: November 23, 2022About 'Creed III'Creed III is in development so this November release date seems optimistic but we shall see. The sequel will mark the directorial debut of star Michael B. Jordan, but Sylvester Stallone won't be appearing as Rocky Balboa. Stallone was rumored to be recruiting heavyweight Deontay Wilder to play Clubber Lang's son in this one but that's not confirmed yet.'Legally Blonde 3'Directed by: Jamie SukStarring: Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Coolidge, Alanna Ubach, Jessica Cauffiel Release date: May 2022About 'Legally Blonde 3'Legally Blonde 3 has a tentative release date of May 2022, but there's no way that'll happen. Mindy Kaling is co-writing the script and has not finished, as of December 2021. But things seem positive for this long-gestating project. Legally Blonde was released in 2001 so Elle Woods has real staying power. It should be fun catching up with her 20 years later, especially with Kaling as a writer. Reese Witherspoon talked about the story with Entertainment Tonight recently, ""It's a lot of me and this lady (Jennifer Coolidge), that's all I have to say.""'Lightyear'Directed by: Angus MacLaneStarring: Chris Evans, Taika WaititiRelease date: June 17, 2022About 'Lightyear'Buzz Lightyear gets his own prequel origin story in the newest Pixar spin-off. Lightyear will star Chris Evans as a younger version of the title character, previously voiced by Tim Allen in the Toy Story movies. Buzz begins as a hotshot test pilot but soon graduates to Space Ranger.Watch a Teaser for 'Lightyear''Pinocchio'Directed by: Guillermo del ToroStarring: Gregory Mann, Ewan McGregor, David Bradley, Ron Perlman, Tilda Swinton, Christoph Waltz, Cate Blanchett, Tim Blake Nelson, Finn Wolfhard, Burn Gorman, John TurturroRelease date: Fall 2022About 'Pinocchio'As you may be aware, the original Italian story, Pinocchio, by Carlo Collodi, is a dark little affair. Disney's version is quite different, but a new 2022 adaptation will hew closer to the original. That's because it's helmed by Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth, The Shape of Water), master of spooky fairy tales. Expect a fantastical ride — the film will be a stop-motion musical (Del Toro's first animated movie). There's plenty of reason to be intrigued, including an all-star voice cast. Ewan McGregor will handle Jiminy Cricket.Watch a Teaser for del Toro's 'Pinocchio''Pinocchio'Directed by: Robert ZemeckisStarring: Tom Hanks, Cynthia Erivo, Luke Evans, Benjamin Evan Ainsworth, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Keegan-Michael Key, Lorraine BraccoRelease date: Fall 2022About 'Pinocchio'While Del Toro delves into dark Pinocchio, Disney is going back to the well for a sunnier, live-action adaptation of the story. Set for a release on Disney+ later this year, Robert Zemeckis will direct Pinocchio with Tom Hanks as Geppetto and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Jiminy Cricket.Watch a Teaser for Disney's 'Pinocchio''Death on the Nile'Directed by: Kenneth BranaghStarring: Kenneth Branagh, Gal Gadot, Armie Hammer, Annette Bening, Rose Leslie, Letitia WrightRelease date: February 11, 2022About 'Death on the Nile'Director Kenneth Branagh's second (Murder on the Orient Express) adaptation of an Agatha Christie mystery in recent years, Death on the Nile should deliver the expected twists and turns. It certainly has an impressive cast. Branagh will play uber-Detective Hercule Poirot once again as he tries to solve the murder of an heiress while on a Nile River cruise.Watch a Trailer for 'Death on the Nile''Downton Abbey: A New Era'Directed by: Simon CurtisStarring: Hugh Bonneville, Elizabeth McGovern, Maggie Smith, Michelle Dockery, Laura Carmichael, Jim Carter, Phyllis LoganRelease date: March 18, 2022About 'Downton Abbey: A New Era'Writer Julian Fellowes returns with the sequel to 2019's Downton Abbey this March. The Crawleys are back and in France this time after the Dowager Countess inherits a villa. Plus, Lady Mary's wedding is on the horizon.Watch a Teaser for 'Downton Abbey: A New Era''Scream'Directed by: Matt Bettinelli-Olpin, Tyler GillettStarring: Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, David Arquette, Jack Quaid, Jenna Ortega, Melissa Barrera, Dylan Minnette, Marley SheltonRelease date: January 14, 2022About 'Scream'The fifth Scream film is both a sequel and soft reboot of the 25-year-old franchise. A new killer is wearing the Ghostface mask and resurrecting old secrets buried in the past. This will be the first in the series to not be directed by the late Wes Craven. Quaid and Barrera lead a new group of victims, and they'll be joined by holdovers Neve Campbell, David Arquette, and Courteney Cox.Watch a Trailer for 'Scream''Halloween Ends'Directed by: David Gordon GreenStarring: Jamie Lee Curtis, Judy Greer, Andi Matichak, Nick CastleRelease date: October 14, 2022About 'Halloween Ends'The latest Michael Myers iteration, David Gordon Green and Danny McBride's trilogy, will conclude with Halloween Ends in 2022. Will Michael die for good this time? Not bloody likely, but a grand finale is expected for this version, anyway. Halloween Ends will be set four years after the events of Halloween Kills and will include a pandemic subplot.Watch a Trailer for 'Halloween Ends''Texas Chainsaw Massacre'Directed by: David Blue GarciaStarring: Sarah Yarkin, Elsie Fisher, Mark Burnham, Jacob Latimore, Moe Dunford, Olwen Fouéré, Alice Krige, Jessica Allain, Nell HudsonRelease date: February 18, 2022About 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre'Netflix will debut the newest Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie. This one will act as a direct sequel to Tobe Hooper's original (and only one really worth seeing) from 1974. It follows a group of teens in Harlow, Texas who run smack dab into Leatherface. One interesting casting choice — Elsie Fisher, the little girl from 2018's Eighth Grade, will play a wheelchair-bound kid named Lila.Watch a Trailer for 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre''Jackass Forever'Directed by: Jeff TremaineStarring: Johnny Knoxville, Steve-O, Chris Pontius, Wee Man, Ehren McGhehey, Sean McInerneyRelease date: February 4, 2022About 'Jackass Forever'The fourth Jackass movie is baked and ready for the masses. And all the boys are back with two exceptions — Bam (fired from the production) and Dunn (RIP). Expect Knoxville, Steve-O, Pontius, England, Wee Man, and the rest to bring the pain, one more time.Watch a Trailer for 'Jackass Forever''Minions: The Rise of Gru'Directed by: Kyle Balda, Brad AbelsonStarring: Steve Carell, Pierre Coffin, Taraji P. Henson, Michelle Yeoh, RZA, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Lucy Lawless, Dolph Lundgren, Danny Trejo, Russell Brand, Julie Andrews, Alan ArkinRelease date: July 1, 2022About 'Minions: The Rise of Gru'The title portends an origin story so expect Steve Carell's supervillain, Gru, to be a big part of this one. Set just after the 2015 film, in the early '70s, 12-year-old Gru is growing up in the suburbs. A fan of a supervillain group known as the Vicious 6, Gru hatches a plan to become evil enough to join them. When the Vicious 6 fire their leader, Gru interviews to become their newest member.Watch a Trailer for 'Minions: The Rise of Gru''Sonic The Hedgehog 2'Directed by: Jeff FowlerStarring: Jim Carrey, Ben Schwartz, Colleen O'Shaughnessey, Idris Elba, James Marsden, Tika Sumpter, Natasha Rothwell, Adam Pally, Shemar MooreRelease date: April 8, 2022About 'Sonic The Hedgehog 2'The Sonic sequel is coming soon after being fast-tracked following the inexplicable success of 2020's Sonic the Hedgehog. This time, Tails (O'Shaughnessey) joins the fun and so does Knuckles (Elba).Watch a Trailer for 'Sonic The Hedgehog 2''Hotel Transylvania: Transformania'Directed by: Jennifer Kluska, Derek DrymonStarring: Andy Samberg, Selena Gomez, Kathryn Hahn, Jim Gaffigan, Steve Buscemi, Molly Shannon, David Spade, Keegan-Michael Key, Brian Hull, Fran Drescher, Brad Abrell, Asher BlinkoffRelease date: January 14, 2022About 'Hotel Transylvania: Transformania'The fourth and supposedly final installment in the Hotel Transylvania franchise will debut right away on Amazon Prime Video in 2022. Hotel Transylvania: Transformania will be the first sequel to not feature Adam Sandler as Dracula. The story sounds like fun, however. When Van Helsing's ""Monsterfication Ray"" doesn't work as planned, all the monsters are turned into humans and Johnny (Samberg) becomes a monster.Watch a Trailer for 'Hotel Transylvania: Transformania'Story originally published on Zimbio on January 21, 2022",https://edition.livingly.com/s/prequels-sequels-remakes-2022-ca60e5ac5ec44e57?utm_campaign=2022upcomingsequels-ffa405995a114c42&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=oat&v=2&utm_term=HOMEPAGE_US,,1/28/2022

(Photo: Getty)The spinning rainbow wheel of death is one of the more frustrating sights in our modern world. Sure, you can refer to it as a beach ball if you’re feeling lighthearted. Or you can call that computer-freezing icon what it really is: the bane of your existence.A slow computer that takes forever to load web pages, open documents, and respond to pretty much any basic command is more common than you think. It’s often just a matter of poor maintenance or disorganization. Powerful tune-up software like System Mechanic will get rid of all the excessive, unnecessary files and other junk clogging up your PC, jumpstarting its performance and boosting your internet speed.System Mechanic addresses up to 30,000 potential problems, running hundreds of critical tests to stop your device from slowing down and crashing. The ultra-private software uses military-grade wiping to make sure things like deleted data and cached web pages are gone from PCs forever, freeing up tons of hard drive space.Try System Mechanic for 30 days free, then $4.99 a monthIf system clogging is not the culprit, though, it could mean your PC or Mac is running a malicious program that you’re unaware of.“Keeping your computer up to date doesn’t just improve your online experience; it can also make attacks from malware, viruses, and scammers more obvious,” says Adam Levin, cyber security expert and founder of CyberScout. “If your computer is always glitchy or running slow, it’s not always obvious whether it’s a newly installed malicious program or a more innocuous problem.”Ready to get your computer back on the fast track? Below are four common culprits for a sluggish computer, plus the software and maintenance solutions that can have you up and running smoothly in no time.Story continuesThe issue: Too many startup programsThe solution: Remove and disable unnecessary programsIf your system practically shuts down before it even boosts up, it's time for a system clean out. (Photo: Getty)An abundance of unnecessary startup programs is one of the most common reasons your computer is so slow, and can tack on up to 10 minutes of boot-up time from the moment you switch on your device, according to Techlicious. As those programs continue to run in the background, they further impede your computer’s speed.Try cleaning up your computer automatically—and in one fell swoop—by installing System Mechanic, the leading solution for decluttering your digital world on PCs. It’ll address all the junk that’s slowing down your PC or Mac, and restore its good working order in no time. System Mechanic offers a free 30-day trial; after that, it’s just $4.99 a month.Try System Mechanic for 30 days free, then $4.99 a monthHere’s how to clean up your computer manually, if you want to get a headstart now: Edit down your default startup programs by first trashing unnecessary desktop icons, then organizing the rest in desktop folders. If you’re using a Mac, navigate to Login Items, then uncheck the programs you don’t need. If you’re on a PC using Windows 8 and above, go to the Startup tab, right-click on the programs you want to remove, and hit Disable.If you’re using Windows 7 or older, navigate to the Startup tab, then uncheck all the programs you don’t need to run whenever you start your computer. Note that antivirus and antimalware programs should always be included in startup programs; the rest are up to your discretion.Don't accidentally give hackers access to your sensitive info. (Photo: Getty)The issue: MalwareThe solution: Install Malwarebytes Premium anti-malware softwareMalware is shorthand for malicious programs that make their way into your computer and wreak havoc, allowing hackers access to sensitive personal information that could lead to identity theft.“Keep your computer clean by always running some type of end-point protection. These often include email scanning, anti-virus, anti-malware, and personal firewall applications to help protect your computer from slowing down and putting your information at risk,” says Ron Culler, Senior Director of Technology and Solutions for ADT Cybersecurity, to Yahoo Life. “Using what [your computer] comes with doesn’t always work, and there are many affordable solutions that often give you the ability to run it on multiple computers in your home.”Malwarebytes Premium is the leading software for detecting existing and emerging security threats thanks to 24/7 smart technology. Not only will it remove any existing malware in your computer, but it’s constantly on the lookout for malicious program infiltrations, blocking them before they even have a chance of striking. Protect up to three Macs or PCs with one Malwarebytes subscription, and reduce your worries about malware slowing down your computer—or worse, exposing sensitive information to predators.Practicing common sense will keep you safe, too. “Pay attention to what you click on when reading emails or browsing the web. It’s very easy to infect your computer with malware or ransomware by clicking links in unsolicited emails or links in social media” says Culler. “You never really know what is at the other end of that enticing link.”Try Malwarebytes Premium for just $4.99 a month, with a 30-day free trailKeep everything updated and you're already ahead of the game. (Photo: Getty)The issue: Your software that is out-of-date.The solution: Turn on automatic updatesBlame it on your laziness: If you’re often ignoring prompts to update your computer’s software, you’re probably hindering its ability to run smoothly. Even worse, you’re all but inviting malware into your system. “Updates are issued when vulnerabilities are found,” says Levin. Some updates pertain to new features, “but many of these features relate to security issues that have been discovered or new ways to better protect you.”“Any time you get a legitimate notice to update your software, don’t click ‘I’ll do it later,’” advises Levin. That being said, he warns never to follow a link from an email to perform a so-called software update; this is most likely a phishing scam. Only perform updates based on actual, legitimate prompts on your computer sent directly from the programs you have installed.Having Malwarebytes Premium running in the background at all times lets you double-down on the protection, in the off chance you accidentally slip up and click on a malicious link. Malwarebytes can help thwart the threat in real life, stepping in when human error occurs.Try Malwarebytes Premium for just $4.99 a month, with a 30-day free trailThe naked eye can't see just how much junk is stored on your computer's hard drive. (Photo: Getty)The issue: Your hard drive is a messThe solution: Clean it up—and “defrag” itConsider your hard drive the storage room of your computer. It’s where everything is kept for the short and long term, from your operating system to anything you’ve ever downloaded from the internet. Your hard drive only has so much space, and when it gets clogged and cluttered, it borrows “mental” energy to sort through things, slowing down its performance when called upon to do other things like load a web page.If your computer’s running on Windows, run a disk cleanup by selecting Disk Cleanup in your Start menu. Then select the files you’re okay with deleting, including those already in your Recycle bin. You’ll also want to “defrag” your hard drive.

You’ve done it. You’ve built up a little cushion in your bank account — $1,000! It feels good, right? Those days of checking your account balance in a panic are behind you.
Congrats! You’re on the right path. Now it’s time to think about some longer-term goals. What do you want to accomplish next with your money? Do you need to save more? Do you want to buy a home someday? Invest?
What’s the next step you should take? What are some specific things you can do to take your finances to the next level?
We’ve got some ideas for you:
1. Invest in Fine Art (Even if You’re Not a Millionaire)
You might be thinking you need at least a few more zeros in your checking account before you can even start thinking about investing in art. Warhol? Monet? Banksy? Yeah right. You just managed to finally put away $1,000. Those guys are way out of your league, right?
Wrong. You could still get started with what you’ve got. Seriously.
A company called Masterworks

 is helping us average folk invest in multimillion-dollar works of art — traditionally one of the most lucrative investment options that’s only available to the super rich. But you don’t need hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy a masterpiece outright; with Masterworks, you can buy shares, instead.
Here’s why it’s a good option: Fine art is super valuable, so it can potentially earn you more money than the stock market. Over the long term, the stock market will earn you an average annual return of 7%, but Masterworks lets you invest in art that’s historically seen a 10% to 25% price appreciation.
This is a long-term strategy, so patience pays off here — literally. But once your piece of art sells, you get your cut of the profits. 
It takes less than a minute to request an invitation

, and you could become a Masterworks member by the end of the day.
2. Cancel Your Car Insurance
When was the last time you compared car insurance rates? Chances are you’re seriously overpaying with your current policy. 
If it’s been more than six months since your last car insurance quote, you should look again. 
And if you look through a website called InsuredNation

, you could save yourself up to $500 a year*. 
It takes just two minutes to answer some questions, and InsuredNation’s smart matching technology will show you the insurance providers that are the best fit for you. And don’t worry — InsuredNation uses advanced data security and encryption technology, so all your details are safe. 
The website is free to use and can even save you up to an additional 20% if you add another vehicle to your policy. You could be paying as little as $19 a month* for car insurance.
InsuredNation has already helped millions of people find affordable car insurance. See how much money you could save
 with a new policy.
3. Use This Secret Debit Card
Tina Russell/The Penny Hoarder 
Here’s the deal: If you’re not using Aspiration’s debit card, you’re missing out on extra cash. And who doesn’t want extra cash?
Yep. A debit card called Aspiration

 gives you up to a 10% back every time you swipe.
Need to buy groceries? Extra cash.
Need to fill up the tank? Bam. Even more extra cash.
This card used to have a huge waiting list, but you’re now eligible to sign up for free.
Enter your email address here

, and link your bank account to see how much extra cash you can get with your free Aspiration account. And don’t worry. Your money is FDIC insured and under a military-grade encryption. That’s nerd talk for “this is totally safe.”
4. Get up to $200 in Free Stocks 
Imagine if you had bought one share of Amazon for $18 when the stock first went public. Today, it would be worth more than $20,000 — despite all the ups and downs in the stock market.
Here’s the thing about millionaires: They know the sooner you start investing, the better. And we found a company that will give you free stock to get started.
An investing app called Robinhood

 will give you up to $200 worth of free stock in companies like Visa, Microsoft and GE, just for downloading its app and opening a free account.
Robinhood is free and easy to navigate, which is why more than 10 million people use it — including both news junkies looking to outsmart the market and people who want to carefully put a few bucks away in a long-term investment.
It takes just a couple of minutes to sign up

 and get your free stock — you may even just get a share of the “next Amazon.”
5. Ask This Website to Help Pay Off Your Credit Cards
No, like… the whole bill. All of it.
While you’re stressing out over your debt, your credit card company is getting rich off those insane interest rates. But a website called Fiona

 could help you pay off that bill as soon as tomorrow.
Here’s how it works: Fiona can match you with a low-interest loan you can use to pay off every credit card balance you have. The benefit? You’re left with just one bill to pay every month, and because the interest rate is so much lower, you can get out of debt so much faster. Plus, no credit card payment this month.
Fiona can help you borrow up to $250,000 (no collateral needed) with fixed rates starting at 2.49%.
Fiona won’t make you stand in line or call a bank. And if you’re worried you won’t qualify, it’s free to check online

. It takes just two minutes, and it could save you thousands of dollars. Totally worth it.
All that credit card debt — and the anxiety that comes with it — could be gone by tomorrow.

*Financial investment involves the risk of loss

My 9-year-old daughter looked up at me with a no-nonsense look and said, “Mom, what do you have to be sorry about?!”She was right.But if you’re a woman, perhaps you can relate to my reaction.You may automatically find yourself saying “I’m sorry” often – if you can’t make it to a meeting, if you can’t accommodate a last-minute request, even if you’re taking a “little too long” to decide on your order at a restaurant.So what gives? Why does the need to apologize feel like such a default for so many of us?https://www.instagram.com/p/CbQoOx_pNCgThe root of the answer may very well lie in stereotypes. Many studies have shown that women’s behaviors are often typecast - for example, women are expected to be communal and nurturing, and to avoid being dominant. Not surprisingly, researchers found that when women act out of alignment with those expected behaviors, they are seen less positively by others. These stereotypes often go unspoken and unchecked. And the truth is, we take plenty of cues about them and what’s expected from us, starting at a very young age.Part of the apology habit may have to do with differences in what constitutes an “offense” in the first place. One comparative study, in Psychological Science, found that while both men and women apologized in equal proportion for what they considered to be offensive behavior, women actually reported committing more offenses than men. This finding suggests that men apologize less frequently than women because they have a higher threshold for what constitutes offensive behavior.No matter the reason, the problem with over-apologizing is that it can lessen other’s respect for you. Of course, a heartfelt apology is meaningful and necessary at times, but a constant stream of saying sorry is not.The other issue is that overdoing it with apologies can be self-reinforcing. When we say it enough, it can become a little too believable that in fact we are in other people’s way, that we’re a bother or that we shouldn’t be taking up their time. Another problematic feature of chronic apologizing is that in some cases, it can be fueled more by our own high standards of interactions than the standards of those around us!In honor of stopping the apologizing madness in my own life, here are five phrases I’m going to purposely retire in 2022 — and some replacements I'll use instead. I hope you'll join me!Instead of: “I just wanted to share…”Try: “I want to share…”The logic: So often, we say “just” to soften up a direct, assertive message. The problem is, it demeans whatever we have to say with it.Selena Rezvani is a women's leadership speaker and author of the award-winning book, ""Pushback: How Smart Women Ask - And Stand Up - For What They Want.""Gabrielle SmarrInstead of: “I may be wrong, but…""“Try: “Here’s what I know today…”The logic: We could all be wrong, at any time, about anything. That doesn’t mean we need to lead with it – it’s better to focus on what you do know.Instead of: “Sorry to bother you…”Try: “When you have a moment, I’d like X.”The logic: You’re not a bother for interacting with colleagues – collaboration is how we accomplish so many things today. Even if you are bothering someone, trust that they’ll let you know a better time or when they can get to your request.Rachel Hollis on refusing to apologizeJuly 12, 201904:39Instead of: “Does that make sense?”Try: “What are your thoughts/reactions?”The logic: Rest assured, you do make sense. If people have a question, they’ll let you know. What you can’t know are others’ thoughts and reactions, so ask about that.Instead of: “I hope that’s OK…”Try: “Thanks for considering it.”The logic: You can be consultative without asking other people for permission. Instead of transferring approval to them, ask them to consider your request and thank them.The less I over-apologize, the better I feel. It’s liberating to shake off the feeling that you’re constantly stepping on someone’s toes. Or that your need for information is inconveniencing people.

The Daily Wire,New Details Emerge About Boeing 737 That Nosedived Into Ground: ‘A Battle For Control’ Of The…,,"New Details Emerge About Boeing 737 That Nosedived Into Ground: ‘A Battle For Control’ Of The Plane | The Daily WireThe Daily WireMenuCloseReadListenWatchDiscussShopSearchLoginJoin— News and Analysis —New Details Emerge About Boeing 737 That Nosedived Into Ground: ‘A Battle For Control’ Of The PlaneBy  Ryan Saavedra•Mar 23, 2022   DailyWire.com•FacebookTwitterMailZhou Hua/Xinhua via Getty Images
New details emerged on Tuesday about the China Eastern Airlines Boeing 737-800 that was caught on camera crashing vertically into a mountain range earlier this week, which left no known survivors.“The Boeing 737-800 was knifing through the air at more than 640 miles (966 kilometers) per hour, and at times may have exceeded 700 mph,” Bloomberg News reported. “Sound travels at 761 mph at sea level but slows with altitude as air temperature goes down and is about 663 mph at 35,000 feet.”Flightradar24 released data from the flight that showed the aircraft was cruising at just over 29,000 feet when it then plunged more than 20,000 feet in less than a minute before later slamming into the mountains of southern China.The Air Current noted that the fact that Flightradar24 was able to collect data from the flight as it rapidly plunged toward the ground means “the aircraft had electrical power and was able to broadcast tracking telemetry.”The South China Morning Post, which is owned by the Chinese Alibaba Group, reported that the flight data “depicted a battle for control of China Eastern Airlines flight” as there appears to have been a temporary recovery in altitude followed by a second nosedive that took the plane straight into the ground.“It was an exceedingly high-energy crash,” said Bob Mann, president of R.W. Mann & Co. consultancy. “It looks like it literally evaporated into a crater. Do the flight data recorder or cockpit voice recorder or quick access recorder — do any survive? I just don’t know the answer.”The New York Times reported that investigators were still trying to locate the plane’s black boxes, which record flight data and voice recorders.“The aircraft was severely damaged in this accident, and the investigation is very difficult,” Zhu Tao, the director of aviation safety at the Civil Aviation Administration of China, said. “With the information currently available, it is still impossible to make a clear judgment on the cause of the accident.”The Times added:Mr. Zhu confirmed a few details about the trajectory of the plane that had emerged in flight data shared by Flightradar24, a tracking platform, while also describing for the first time how air traffic controllers had tried to contact the plane when they noticed something amiss.The plane been cruising at about 29,000 feet around 2:17 p.m. on Monday, he said, but a few minutes later, air traffic controllers had noticed that the plane had suddenly lost altitude. He said the controllers immediately called the plane crew, but did not receive a reply after several attempts. By 2:23 p.m., the plane’s radar signal disappeared, he said, and it had crashed.“It really catches your eye when you see how rapidly the aircraft went from this horizontal flight,” Mike Daniel, a former Federal Aviation Administration accident investigator, said. “On any given investigation, you can’t rule out foul play at the very beginning,” he said. “It was so abrupt that everything needs to be looked at.”Australian aviation expert Neil Hansford said that he does not believe that the plane crashed due to any kind of technical issue.“Even with total loss of power, no aircraft plummets to the ground from 20,000 feet in two minutes with an event at 8,000 feet,” Hansford said. “I think aircraft technical failure can be ruled out and it will be an external event … I would get on a Boeing 737-800 in an instant with an Australian carrier, so my suggestion would be it won’t be Boeing or aircraft technical related.”“It is very unlikely the pilot passed out as the non-flying pilot would have been able to very safely take over the flying and land the aircraft,” he continued. “Likely scenarios include pilot suicide, aircraft mid-air collision with military aircraft (they don’t have transponders like civil aircraft), [flight MU5735] was struck by a missile or an on-board explosion. My tipping is a human-induced event or bought down by rogue missile. Debris looks like MH117 over Ukraine, and the Chinese are providing too much information this time which is uncharacteristic.”The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest growing conservative media companies for breaking news, investigative reporting, sports, podcasts, in-depth analysis, books, and entertainment for a reason: because we believe in what we do.

On Tuesday, The Daily Wire announced the launch of Jeremy’s Razors — which can be pre-ordered on ihateharrys.com — a new company created in response to Harry’s Razors pulling its ads from The Daily Wire in 2021 over “inexcusable” comments made by a Daily Wire host regarding gender identity.Jeremy’s Razors first ad received high praise across the internet, but Tim Pool, popular podcast host and influential commentator on TimCast.com, lauded The Daily Wire for its efforts and explained brilliantly on his Tuesday podcast why The Daily Wire — and other anti-woke companies and entities — are needed to fight the Left.“The Daily Wire has issued a rebuttal,” Pool told his audience after relaying the story of how Harry’s ditched The Daily Wire. “After one year, they released ihateharrys.com, which is Jeremy’s Razors, and I got to say the commercial they put out may be one of the funniest commercials I’ve seen.”That commercial can be seen here:A year ago, Harry’s Razors advertised on our shows. But then, they pulled their ads due to “values misalignment”. Introducing Jeremy’s Razors. Stop giving your money to woke corporations that hate you. Give it to the god-king: https://t.co/DLWEe8hraR pic.twitter.com/yt5gVG8pl0— Daily Wire (@realDailyWire) March 22, 2022“They hit the nail on the head with a hammer, and, this is significant. If there’s any one company that is doing the most — or doing a lot — to build culture and push back on far-left wokeness — it’s The Daily Wire,” he continued.“Not a day goes by that I am not impressed, inspired, and jealous of what they are doing,” Pool added.“We may end up going and hanging out in Nashville a little bit with the crew from The Daily Wire,” he also teased.“But The Daily Wire is absolutely fantastic,” Pool continued. “I mean, this is brilliant. This is their website, ‘I Hate Harrys…Stop giving your money to people who hate you. Give it to me instead.’ And there’s god-king Jeremy Boreing with the cut on his face from shaving.”“So they tell the story breaking down why they’re launching this new product and it’s absolutely hilarious,” Pool continued. “But in this segment, I will talk to you not just about the fact The Daily Wire has created their own razor company, but also how many on the Left are accidentally watching The Daily Wire’s new cultural content and then going, ‘Oh no, what have I done?! I enjoyed Ben Shapiro’s movie?!’”“This is fascinating. We at Timcast.com are trying to do something relatively similar, maybe slightly different. The Daily Wire knows the power of culture,” he remarked. “Ben Shapiro and the crew there at The Daily Wire, they understand you have to build culture.”“For the longest time now, for I think several years, they’ve been working towards releasing movies and TV shows, and we’ve been talking to Daily Wire about, you know, making some kind of show or content — I don’t know exactly if it’s anything significant — but you know Ian over at TimCast IRL, he’s got crazy ideas for shows and maybe something will come of this,” the host added.“But we’re inspired” by Jeremy’s Razors, he added. “You know I watch these Netflix shows, I watch these movies, and the wokeness, it’s just, it’s palpable. Even when it’s a light touch, I’m just like I don’t agree with those values so it comes off just bad, truth be told.”“We have a similar mindset to a lot of the crew at Daily Wire because we’ve talked about what we can make in terms of services and products. So we have, of course, our own book,” which can be found here.“Our first book! We have a book, man, we are like 30 employees, we are nowhere near as big as a Daily Wire, but I am inspired by the work they’re doing,” Pool continued before dedicating nearly 30 minutes to the latest and greatest out of The Daily Wire.Tim Pool’s segment can be seen here:Related: ‘At That Very Moment, I Knew We Had To Launch A Razor Company’: Jeremy Boreing Talks ‘Jeremy’s Razors’ Conception, Purpose‘This Is How You Fight Back’: Daily Wire’s Anti-Woke Jeremy’s Razor Ad Receives Applause, New CustomersThe Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies for breaking news, investigative reporting, sports, podcasts, in-depth analysis, books, and entertainment for a reason: because we believe in what we do.

GRAND RAPIDS, MI: FBI handlers told informant Dan Chappel to label an “innocent man” a federal agent to avoid potential detection, an attorney said Tuesday in the trial over a conspiracy to kidnap Michigan Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer.Chappel worked for the FBI as an informant in 2020 as part of the Bureau’s investigation into the plot to kidnap Whitmer over her COVID-19 policies. Of six men arrested and accused of taking part in the conspiracy, two have pleaded guilty. Brandon Caserta, Barry Croft Jr., Adam Fox, and Daniel Harris are contesting the charge.Chappel, called to the stand by prosecutors, testified that FBI handlers directed him to accuse another man, identified as Trent, of being a federal agent to divert suspicion from himself. Chappel said that at one point during his work as an informant, he was concerned about being compromised and outed as working with the FBI.During cross-examination, Caserta’s defense attorney Michael Hills pressed Chappel on the FBI’s reaction to his fears. Hills highlighted that the FBI directed Chappel to tell a group of men the federal government is now accusing of planning a violent plot to kidnap a sitting governor that an “innocent man” was actually an agent.Chappel said that the FBI made the determination because the man was already mocked as “fed boy” by other militia members because of his “high-dollar” weapons and his propensity for skipping training. Chappel never accused “fed boy” of being a federal agent, nor was Chappel discovered as an informant during the investigation.Chappel testified on Friday that the accused men agreed to a plan to attack Whitmer’s Elk Rapids cottage, assassinate her security detail, and abduct her to stand trial in a “kangaroo court” in Wisconsin. Attorneys for the four defendants argue that their clients were entrapped by federal agents into the scheme.Croft attorney Joshua Blanchard suggested in his opening statement that FBI informants inappropriately obtained evidence because they were being compensated by the federal government. During his chance to cross-examine Chappel, Blanchard pointed to the former informant’s own compensation.Chappel confirmed that he was paid about $54,000 in compensations and reimbursements for his work as an FBI informant. His job as a contract truck driver for the Postal Service earns him $55,000-$60,000 a year, he said. Chappel noted that he stopped working for about 4 months while he was an informant in 2020.Blanchard brought out a receipt showing that Chappel had requested and received reimbursements from the FBI for a roughly $3,400 Microsoft Surface Book laptop, $190 laptop docking station, $20 mouse, and an $85 Surface Pen. Chappel also spent, and was reimbursed, about $205 for an extended warranty on the laptop. Blanchard introduced another receipt, which was not presented to the jury over uncensored personal information, showing Chappel was also reimbursed for a Samsung Galaxy Smartwatch.Chappel is the most important witness to testify in the trial so far and one of the most relevant figures in the case. Chappel’s tip to a police officer in March 2020 worked its way to the FBI and played a key role in the Bureau’s decision to start investigating a Michigan militia group known as the Wolverine Watchmen. The FBI conducted a nearly seven-month investigation into the group and others before arresting six men in October 2020 on charges of conspiracy to kidnap Michigan’s governor, as well as a slew of other charges.The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest growing conservative media companies for breaking news, investigative reporting, sports, podcasts, in-depth analysis, books, and entertainment for a reason: because we believe in what we do.

The Daily Wire,How Religion And The Arbitrary Decision Of One Prince Explains Russia’s – And Ukraine’s –…,,"How Religion And The Arbitrary Decision Of One Prince Explains Russia’s – And Ukraine’s – Disastrous History | The Daily WireThe Daily WireMenuCloseReadListenWatchDiscussShopSearchLoginJoin— Opinion —How Religion And The Arbitrary Decision Of One Prince Explains Russia’s – And Ukraine’s – Disastrous HistoryBy  Larry Alex TauntonDailyWire.comFacebookTwitterMailOur first hint that the Russo-Ukrainian War may have an ancient and complicated backstory appears with the discovery that the first Russian state, indeed, the first Ukrainian state, was not founded in modern day Russia. It was founded in Kiev in the ninth century. Ever since, the two countries, which are sometimes the same country, have been locked in a seemingly endless love-hate relationship. Where Zelensky wants Ukrainian independence, Soviet stalwarts Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev, both Ukrainian, considered such thinking treasonous.But that ancient and complicated history goes much deeper than a centuries-old dysfunctional relationship. Unlike the linear histories of Western nations, the histories of Russia and Ukraine are cyclical, where, to paraphrase novelist Leon Uris, there is no future, only the past repeating itself. This isn’t the sort of past you want to repeat: conquest, occupation, enslavement, conquest again, state-engineered famines, genocide, collectivization, purges, fascism, genocide again, Communism, nuclear disaster — these countries have experienced them all.And it was in Kiev, more than a millennium ago, that the tragic course was set.It was there in 988, a date long regarded by historians as one of the most fateful in the history of Eastern Europe, that Vladimir, Prince of Kievan Rus, gave his people a religious makeover. Paganism was becoming passé among the civilized peoples of Europe, and Kievan Rus, pagan to its core, wanted to modernize. According to The Primary Chronicle, Russia’s oldest native historical source, Prince Vladimir received emissaries from the major religious options then available.First came the “Bulgars of Mohammedan faith,” who told him of their religious practices and that upon death each man would receive “complete fulfillment of their carnal desires.” This included “seventy fair women.” History records that “Vladimir listened to them, for he was fond of women and indulgence …” Their religion was in the running until they told Vladimir that as a member of this faith, he would not be permitted to drink alcohol. Speaking like a true Russian, his response was emphatic:“Drinking is the joy of the Russes!”Next came “the Germans, asserting that they were come as emissaries of the Pope.” Catholicism is given only a brief treatment in the Chronicle. Vladimir rejected that faith for reasons very similar to his rejection of Islam: his appetites. These Germans told him he must fast from time to time. Vladimir replied with a definitive nyet: “Depart hence; our fathers accepted no such principle.”Judaism, however, receives a more extensive discussion, and, in a theme that would plague Russian-Ukrainian history, it is not without anti-Semitism:“The Jewish Khazars heard of these missions, and came themselves saying, ‘We have learned that Bulgars and Christians came hither to instruct you in their faiths. The Christians believe in him whom we crucified …’”This time, it was circumcision that was “disagreeable to him” and the absence of a homeland: “If God loved you and your faith, you would not be thus dispersed in foreign lands. Do you expect us to accept that fate also?”Zero for three, a humble Greek scholar from Constantinople was all that remained. He wasted no time in attacking his predecessors’ sales pitches. He first took aim at the Roman Catholics. Although these events occurred more than a half century before “The Great Schism” (1054) which split the church into Roman and Greek factions, hints of the breach were already present. (This is probably because the Chronicle was written after the Schism.)In explaining the sacrament of communion to Vladimir, this Greek scholar said the Romans did it wrong because they used “wafers.” One doubts Vladimir was much over-worried about such particulars since he had already rejected Catholicism on the basis of what they didn’t eat. As for the Muslims, he said they “were accursed above all men” for their “vile” practices “which out of modesty may not be written down.” Predictably, anti-Semitism appears again, and the Greek dismisses the Jews as killers of the Prophets and Jesus.This left only the religion he had come to represent: Greek Orthodoxy. In a lengthy discourse, the Greek explained the history of the world from creation to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Impressed, Vladimir sent envoys to Constantinople to appraise the Greek faith and verify the truth of these claims. There they beheld Emperor Justinian’s marvel, Hagia Sophia. This was long before the Ottomans trashed it. Russia had no equivalent. No one did. They were understandably overawed by what they saw there. Reporting back to Prince Vladimir, they said:“We knew not whether we were in heaven or on earth…. We know only that God dwells there among men.”Whatever Vladimir’s reservations, they evaporated upon the discovery that drinking was permitted, and circumcision was not required. Vladimir knew this was the religion for him, and he was soon thereafter baptized. It is arguable that Vladimir understood the Christian ethic he had ostensibly adopted given that he ordered his subjects, upon penalty of death, to be likewise baptized. But he did make a lot of converts that way. And so, on the whims and the carnal appetites of a prince, Kievan Rus — that is, Russia and Ukraine — the course for disaster was set, reverberating down the centuries to our own time.Why was 988 such a disaster?The adoption of Greek Orthodoxy forever separated Russia and Ukraine, both European countries, from the Western world culturally and linguistically. It was through the Latin (i.e., Catholic) West that cultural transformation came. Hence, they never experienced the seismic changes of the Renaissance, the Reformation, the Enlightenment, the Scientific Revolution, and the Industrial Revolution, all epochs that defined the West and Western thought. And, though the all-cultures-are-equal zeitgeist says it is unacceptable to now say so, these served to catapult the West ahead of the rest of the world technologically, militarily, and politically.By the twentieth century, Russia and Ukraine lagged behind the West by a good two centuries. The earliest rumblings of the Industrial Revolution were first heard in England in the 1740s. They would not be heard in Russia or Ukraine until the first of the Five-Year Plans in 1928. Indeed, with the adoption of the Gregorian calendar not coming until February 1918, more than 300 years after it was developed and adopted by most of Western Europe, these countries were a full thirteen days behind the West before they abandoned the Julian calendar. Thus, the much-celebrated “October Revolution” in 1917, didn’t actually occur in October at all.The upshot of all of this is that Greek Orthodoxy as practiced by Russians and Ukrainians, who never really abandoned their paganism, has a history of xenophobia, anti-Semitism, and otherworldliness in the extreme. All religions are, by definition, otherworldly. But Christianity in the West — both Catholicism and Protestantism — taught man’s dominion over nature and his earthly mission to subjugate it, thus giving birth to science, capitalism, and democracy. Russian Orthodoxy produced their antithesis.Russian Orthodoxy didn’t even serve as an effective ideological bulwark against barbarism. The Mongols galloped across the Russian and Ukrainian steppes in 1241. They brutalized and ruled these peoples for two hundred years, firmly establishing a style of governance in the minds of both Russians and Ukrainians that has never departed, casting a dark a long shadow over not only their past, but their present, and very likely their future.In his book A People’s Tragedy, Cambridge historian Orlando Figes makes a profound observation regarding the communist (think socialist) takeover in Russia. He states that the triumph of Marxism (think socialism) in 1917 Russia can in no small measure be attributed to the fact that there were no viable competing ideologies. Marxism had, in effect, been set loose in an ideological vacuum. When Bolshevism (think socialism) was injected into the body politic, the disease spread with little resistance. Marxism had no such monopoly in the West where it was subjected to withering criticism from free people in an uncensored press.This reflects poorly on the Orthodox Church at the time. Having become wedded to the autocratic czarist regime, the Church’s role was largely one of ceremony and preserving the status quo. Count Sergei Witte, once prime minister and modernizer of Russia, wrote on the eve of the Bolshevik Revolution:If one takes a long view of the of the future, then, in my opinion, the greatest danger facing Russia comes from the sad state of the Orthodox Church and the decline in genuine religious spirit… Without a truly living church to give [spiritual ideals] expression, religion becomes philosophy and is unable to influence life. Without religion, the masses turn into beasts, worse than four-legged beasts because humans possess intelligence. Our church has turned into a dead, bureaucratic institution, and its services are conducted not to celebrate the God in heaven, but the earthly gods. Orthodoxy has become a kind of paganism. Herein lies our greatest danger. We have gradually become less Christian.Western pundits and policymakers alike continually assume — as they did with Stalin, the Ayatollah, Saddam, Osama bin Laden, and now Putin — that we are dealing with people who think as we do. This isn’t so. Democracy as it is understood in the West is utterly alien to Russia and Ukraine contrary to the rosy, fawning portrayals of the latter in Western media.In his book The Russian Tragedy — notice how “tragedy” appears a lot in discussions of these countries? — Hugh Ragsdale, the late historian of Russian history and, not coincidentally, chair of my master’s examinations committee, wrote:Russians and students of Russia appreciate more easily than others the crucial element of religion in Russian public life, and the Western newcomer to the subject must simply prepare to contemplate what is by his own familiar patterns of thought the nearly inconceivable.To this, Prince Vladimir would likely give a hearty da — and then throw back a shot of vodka before laying waste to yet another city.Larry Alex Taunton is a freelance columnist contributing to USA Today, Fox News, First Things, The Atlantic, The New York Post, CNN, Daily Caller, and The American Spectator.

Republican Texas Senator John Cornyn grilled Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson on whether her judicial philosophy would lead to her engaging in “judicial policy-making,” during her nomination hearing Tuesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee Tuesday.Cornyn’s questions began with a line of questioning based on the landmark case Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. Cornyn pointed out that the Obergefell decision overruled referendums in 32 states and “articulated a new fundamental right,” using a legal doctrine called “substantive due process.”The Supreme Court articulated substantive due process from a confluence of the 5th amendment and the 14th amendment to the Constitution, but “historically it’s been applied in ways that seem to sanction explicit policy-making by the courts,” Cornyn argued, asking whether “substantive due process” was just a tool used by the court to “hide their policy-making under the guise of interpreting the Constitution.”“The Justices have interpreted the due process clause of the 14th amendment to include a substantive provision, that the rights to due process, they have interpreted that to mean not just procedural rights relative to government action, but also the protection of certain personal rights related to intimacy and autonomy,” Jackson responded, adding that among those rights are the rights to marriage, abortion, and contraception.“Well the fact is, is it not, that you can use substantive due process to justify basically any result?” Cornyn interjected. “It’s a mode of analysis by the Court that allows the Court to substitute its opinion for the elected representatives of the people. Would you agree?”“The Court has identified standards for the determination of rights under the 14th amendment substantive due process,” Jackson replied.“Who gives them the right to do that?” Cornyn asked. “If it’s not mentioned in the Constitution, where does the right of the court [come from] to substitute its views for that of the elected representatives of the people?”“The Court has interpreted the 14th amendment to include this component, the unenumerated right to substantive due process, and the Court has said that the kinds of things that qualify are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty or deeply rooted in our nation’s history and tradition,” said Jackson.Cornyn then shifted to the fact that Obergefell overruled the will of the states in recognizing same-sex marriage. “When the Court overrules the decision made by the people … that is an act of judicial policy-making, is it not?”“Senator, the Supreme Court has considered that to be an application of the substantive due process clause of the 14th amendment,” Jackson responded.“Well, one of the things that concerns me is, here is an example of the courts finding a new fundamental right that is mentioned nowhere in the document of the Constitution, that’s the product of simply court-made law we’re all supposed salute smartly and follow, because nine people, who are unelected, who have lifetime tenure … five of them decide that this is the way the world should be.” Citing the 9th amendment, Cornyn then asked, “What other rights do you believe exist? And how could we anticipate what those might be?”Jackson said she could not answer the question because it was hypothetical, but that substantive due process rights were established by Supreme Court precedent.Cornyn then laid out the reason why he was concerned about applying what he felt were loose Constitutional doctrines. “As a trial judge, of course, you were bound by Circuit Court precedent, and on the Circuit Court you were bound by the Supreme Court precedent. But as a member of the United States Supreme Court you will be bound by nothing. You will be unaccountable to the voters … So you’re not gonna be able to find the answer in some law book somewhere. You’re gonna be presented with a case is gonna be made [that] this is an unenumerated fundamental right, and the voters, whatever they’ve said is irrelevant, because we, five members of the Supreme Court, are gonna decide what the law of the land should be,” Cornyn said.You can watch the full exchange here.The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

Celebrities tend to keep the details of their sex life private, but when it comes to their choice to wait until marriage, some stars are actually willing to open up.

The reasons for their abstinence range from religious beliefs to relationship building — but no matter what their thoughts, they made the decision that felt right to them!






Find out what these celebs had to say about their choice...

Jessica Simpson

Prior to tying the knot with Nick Lachey, Jessica Simpson was extremely open about her decision to remain a virgin until she was married. Jessica says she was very nervous about discussing the topic with Nick for the first time, but he ""stayed patient"" until they tied the knot in 2002.  “He paused, taking it all in. I thought, ‘Well, Jessica, this dreamboat has sailed.’ ‘I respect that,’ he said. ‘Thank you for telling me,’” Jessica wrote in her memoir Open Book about the moment she told Nick.

Justin and Hailey Bieber

Justin Bieber may have been with other people before his wife Hailey, but by the time they reconnected in 2019, he was already more than a year into a self-imposed tenure of celibacy. Together, the couple decided to continue to refrain from having sex until they were married — a choice Justin admitted he wished he had made earlier in his life. “[God] doesn’t ask us not to have sex for him because he wants rules and stuff. He’s like, I’m trying to protect you from hurt and pain. I think sex can cause a lot of pain. Sometimes people have sex because they don’t feel good enough. Because they lack self-worth. Women do that, and guys do that. I wanted to rededicate myself to God in that way because I really felt it was better for the condition of my soul. And I believe that God blessed me with Hailey as a result,” Justin told Vogue.

Adriana Lima

Victoria's Secret model Adriana Lima's Catholic faith influenced her decision to save herself for marriage. She explained that any potential suitors would just have to respect her decision — and if they weren't willing to wait, then they weren't the right person for her. “Sex is for after marriage. They have to respect that this is my choice. If there’s no respect, that means they don’t want me,"" Adriana told GQ.

Miranda Kerr and Evan Spiegel

When Miranda Kerr started dating Snapchat founder Evan Spiegel, the couple decided to wait until marriage to have sex because of Evan's traditional beliefs. In an interview, Miranda was asked about the possibility of having children before their wedding as she didn’t use birth control, but she explained it wouldn't be physically possible. ""Not yet. Not until after we get married. My partner is very traditional. We can’t...I mean we’re just...waiting,” Miranda told The Times.

Yvonne Orji

Insecure star Yvonne Orji may have filmed multiple sex scenes for the show, but behind the scenes, she's actually saving herself for marriage. Yvonne, who has yet to tie the knot, says it was her strong faith that encouraged her decision. “Before any of [the fame] happened, I sat down with myself and with God and thought, when I make it, how do you want me to represent you while I’m here? It was like, okay, I know why I’m here. It’s to make you proud,"" Orji told People.

Kevin Jonas

Kevin Jonas and his younger brothers famously wore purity rings for much of their adolescence, in part due to their religious upbringing. While Nick and Joe ended up taking their rings off, Kevin saw things through until he tied the knot with his wife Danielle in 2009. “I could’ve gotten married the day after we got engaged. We’d have gone crazy waiting any longer,” Kevin jokingly told People.

Tim Tebow

Football star Tim Tebow's faith led him make the decision to practice abstinence until he was married. Before tying the knot with Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters in 2020, Tim explained that he just wanted to find someone who truly loved him. ""It's about finding a girl who likes me for me, and not because of what I do, or who I am, or the name,"" he told People of his decision.

Tina Fey

Tina Fey was a virgin until she married her husband Jeff Richmond at age 24. She joked her reasoning was a mixture between her Christian values and also just not having anyone interested in her. ""[I] couldn't give it away. That's just good, Christian values, or being homely,"" Tina said on The Late Show.

Jordin Sparks grew up in a very strict Christian household where she made a vow to practice abstinence until she was married. She even wore a purity ring to represent her commitment. Jordin kept true to her word until she married her husband Dana Isaiah in 2017. ""I don't want to give away bits of my soul to lots of different guys — I want to give all of myself to the right man on the right night. And the right night is my wedding,"" she told Celebs Now.

When Tamera Mowry began dating her now-husband Adam Housley, the couple decided that they would wait until their wedding to have sex. Tamera explained that it helped them keep their faith at the center of their relationship.“We said, ‘It’s got to be God’s way and not our way.’ We didn’t want to half-step anything. So our right way was the way we felt God wanted us to do it, which was being celibate. We said to God, ‘This is who we are, I know you take us as we are, our faults, our fears, our joys, our hope as a couple and have your way.’ You just have to keep God the center of your relationship,” Tamera told Ebony.

When Ciara and Russell Wilson began dating in 2015, the couple took a vow of celibacy until they walked down the aisle. Ciara explained that abstaining from sex helped them build a stronger foundation for their relationship, which set the tone for their life together. ""I really believe that when you focus on a friendship, you have the opportunity to build a strong foundation for a relationship — and once you know you're really great friends and you're what we call 'equally yoked,' where you share the same values or the same outlook on life, it kind of sets the tone. Knowing that you'll always have the friendship and that you can always go back to it is very important, and very powerful...You shouldn't feel like you have to give your body away to get someone to like you,"" Ciara told Cosmopolitan South Africa.

After Andy Grammer tied the knot with his wife Aijia Lise, he revealed that he had waited to have sex until they got married. The musician shared the decision during a talk show appearance where the topic of younger millennials being sexually inactive was being discussed. “I actually waited until I was married to have sex. That was not without some porn, unfortunately,"" Andy said on The Talk.

Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon weren't virgins before they tied the knot, but they did decide to remain abstinent from sex until they were married. The couple only dated for two months before they got married in 2008, but Mariah says their choice made everything more special. “It’s not that we had no intimacy; we just didn’t have complete intimacy. It’s just me, and my feelings. I definitely don’t want to push it on anybody else. But we both have similar beliefs, and I just thought that it would be so much more special if we waited until after we were married. And it was, and it still is,” Mariah told Mirror.

Grey's Anatomy star Sarah Drew says she had no trouble relating to her devout Christian character April because she, too, had waited to have sex until she was married. “For April, the first thing that was revealed was she was a virgin. I waited until I was married to have sex, so I understood April’s motivations. The writers thought it would be a really cool and interesting story to tell that isn’t seen too often,"" Sarah told Fox News.

Kathie Lee Gifford

Television personality Kathie Lee Gifford says she waited until marriage to have sex — but is one of the only people on this list to admit she regretted her decision. Kathie Lee says after she tied the knot with Paul Johnson, she realized she had no sexual compatibility with him. ""It was time for candles and romance, time to boogie and swing from the chandeliers. And yet, we just couldn't seem to get relaxed with each other. We saved ourselves for so long and expected it to be so good because we had done it 'right.' It was not passionate, and it was not successful, but it was polite,"" Kathie Lee wrote in her autobiography.

""Contrary to popular belief, it often doesn’t work out great if you add your chopped/minced garlic first to hot oil or butter. It burns so quickly and tastes yuck. I like to brown something else first, like onions, and then add the garlic. The onions are like a burn buffer!""

2.
""The amount of garlic flavor is dependent on WHEN you add the garlic. Add it early for light flavor, add it late for bold flavor.""

""A dropped knife has no handle, so don't try to catch it when it's falling. You WILL get hurt.""

4.
""You follow instructions when baking. You follow your heart when cooking (...but not too much.)""













  Peopleimages / Getty Images/iStockphoto



—u/Frodo_noooo""Baking is a perfect example of 'don't tear down walls unless you know why they were built.' If you know the chemistry at play and what each ingredient is doing, you can get creative. Keep in mind that every ingredient does something, so add-ons and substitution can change how everything works together.""—u/ArthurBonesly







5.
""Sometimes when you think something needs more salt, what it really needs is acid — lemon juice, vinegar, etc.""


—u/Acceptable_Medicine2""I recommend choosing an acid based on what you are cooking. Italian? Try some red wine vinegar. Mexican? Try some lime juice. Additionally, if you are working with anything cream based, add acidity literally right at the end or else your sauce/dish will curdle.""—u/outoftuneGstring2112




6.
""If you want crispness on the outsides of your meats, you should pat them dry before seasoning and putting them in oven or over heat.""

""Adding is easy, but removing is hard. People like to argue that you should liberally add butter and seasoning, but tastes differ. It's totally fine to put in less if that's what you fancy.""


—u/0x53r3n17y




10.
""If you’re getting annoyed because it’s taking you too long to peel garlic, place an unpeeled garlic clove under the flat side of your kitchen knife and press on it with your hand. The garlic peel will separate easily and your garlic will be crushed.""

""A good kitchen should be equipped with a plentiful supply of clean, dry towels.""


—u/Ben_zyl""If your towels or oven mitt get wet (or your hands are wet while using them on something hot), they will NOT protect your hands.""—u/nicholasgnames




12.
""Massively improve the quality of your proteins (chicken, beef, tofu, anything) with fond. Fond is the dark brown stuff that sticks to your pan when you're cooking. It's not burnt unless its actually black. To get it off the pan and on the food, pour in either an alcohol or acid to dissolve it and get the now-brown liquid to coat your protein.""

""Different proteins work best with different alcohols. Good rule of thumb — dry white for chicken or any lighter meat. Red for beef. Lemon juice works great for almost everything.""—u/maverickmain







13.
""Soy sauce goes on more than just Asian foods. Try a dash in scrambled eggs or towards the end of your caramelized onions. It is a savory salt flavor that compliments many dishes.""

""Set the oven to 405º, line a baking sheet with tin foil, and lay your bacon flat on it. Cook it for 13-15 minutes. It's perfect every time, and you can cook a lot more at once this way. Also, the fat hardens on the foil, so you can just throw it away with no mess.""—u/apeanutbutterpopcorn







15.
""For thick and nice sauces, use the water you cook your pasta with.""


—u/IZiOstraThe starch in the pasta water helps to thicken the sauce and add flavor.




16.
""Have ingredients prepared before starting to cook.""

""It seems like quite a Pinterest thing, but having the ingredients cut, weighed, and peeled ahead of time makes cook times faster and makes it easier for you to be in the moment while cooking. Many recipes can be spoiled if you have to stop everything and prepare an ingredient. Also, don't forget to bring your butter and eggs to room temperature and defrosted or anything you need beforehand.""—u/nora_morgendorffer

""Time is the best and most expensive ingredient.""


—u/JimBones31""Pressure cookers and pre-made/frozen ingredients are good, but they won't ever be as good as home-cooked, low and slow meals. I still use those of course, but when I get the chance to break out my crock pot and let time work it's magic...oooh boy it's something else entirely.""—u/Picker-Rick

Anyone can read what you share.Give this article337Read in appBy Amelia NierenbergMarch 22, 2022Q: Will Botox injections in my 20s or 30s mean smoother skin and fewer wrinkles down the line?While the majority of people who use botulinum toxin, the neurotoxic protein known by its brand name Botox, are women over 40, there has been chatter on social media about how starting it when you’re young can help stall the signs of aging — before they even start.The basic premise: If you start using Botox, which freezes wrinkles, when you’re young, you won’t form the grooves people try to “correct” later in life.In 2020, about 811,000 Botox procedures were performed on people in their 30s, which was approximately 18 percent of the national total, according to a recent report from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. This “prejuvenation” trend seems especially persistent on social media, with testimonials from influencers on YouTube and TikTok.While most dermatologists agree that this approach works, some worry that patients are making interventions too early, or warn against the long-term financial cost of repeated injections.“You do it to slow down the aging process, not to stop it,” said Dr. Shereene Idriss, a dermatologist and the founder of Idriss Dermatology in New York City.We talked to more than a dozen experts to find out whether “preventative Botox” is a wise investment.What’s the claim?Botox limits movement by blocking acetylcholine, the chief neurotransmitter. Over time, the theory goes, a repeat user of Botox weakens her facial muscles, slowing the process in which dynamic lines (those that form when she is making an expression) settle into static lines (those visible when her face is at rest).“Basically, you’re inhibiting the muscle contractions and decreasing the facial movement,” said Dr. Kristen Broderick, an assistant professor of plastic and reconstructive surgery at Johns Hopkins Medicine. “And then, therefore, you’re preventing or slowing the formation of wrinkles over time.”Doctors stress that the wrinkles are postponed, not prevented. (“Mother Nature always wins,” said Dr. Mathew Avram, the director of the Dermatology Laser & Cosmetic Center and the director of dermatologic surgery at Mass General Hospital in Boston.)Even if you start Botox young, you’re still going to have emotions. Unless you’re frozen solid, you’re going to show those feelings on your face — and eventually wrinkle.The good news is that doctors are no longer serving up the “Botox-face” — think, eyebrows frozen in perpetual surprise, foreheads unwrinkled but not exactly youthful. Now, dermatologists try to smooth while still allowing for movement.Movement, Dr. Idriss said, is essential. “That’s what makes you you.”And even though the neurotoxin wears off in about three to four months, some doctors say it is delaying the natural aging process.“If I’m starting at 25, and I use it until I’m 40, then I’ve saved all of those years of not getting the wrinkles,” said Dr. Patricia Wexler, the founder of Wexler Dermatology in New York City. “So if you stop using the Botox at 45 or 50, you have a new baseline. You’re going to get wrinkles at that point, but they’re not going to be what you would have had.”What’s the evidence?Most dermatologists agree that Botox is a safe and reliable treatment. Millions of procedures are performed each year, with almost no reports of serious side effects.But long-term use has been little studied, and the evidence is overwhelmingly anecdotal. Many dermatologists point to their own smooth foreheads as proof of concept.“I need very little Botox now,” said Dr. Debra Jaliman, an assistant clinical professor in dermatology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and the author of the book “Skin Rules,” who said she began injecting herself in 1991. “My muscles have given up.”There are no large scale clinical or observational studies of preventative Botox. One 2006 study looked at identical twins, just two people, over 13 years. One received regular Botox injections. The other did not. The researchers found that lines were “not evident in the regularly treated twin” where she had received injections, but did appear in her sister. The untreated areas of both their faces showed “comparable aging.” In a follow-up, when the twins were 44, the twin who received treatments did not have static lines at rest; her sister did.A 2011 study looked at whether the effects of repeated injections reduce or eliminate forehead wrinkles long term. Every four months, a group of 45 women, aged 30 to 50, received small amounts of botulinum toxin in their foreheads. Doctors assessed them two years after they began treatment, once the last treatment would have worn off, and found that the neurotoxin significantly reduced their wrinkles.But several dermatologists pointed out the negative effects of pausing treatment.Dr. Loretta Ciraldo, the founder of Dr. Loretta skin care who has practiced dermatology for over 40 years, spoke of patients who had used Botox for decades, and then took a break. When they returned to her office, she said, “it did not help whatsoever. Once it wore off, it wore off.”What if you stop treatment?You’re not going to reverse your progress if you stop treatment — you’ll just get your full mobility back, slowly creating wrinkles.The effect of pausing treatment is hard to track, though, since few people stop injections once they begin. Even though botulinum toxin itself does not form chemical dependence, many people become “addicted” to how their face looks, said Dana Berkowitz, an associate professor of sociology at Louisiana State University.Dr. Berkowitz, the author of “Botox Nation: Changing the Face of America,” has interviewed dozens of people who used Botox for her book. Only one — a man — had ever paused treatment, she said.Your face without Botox “looks ugly to you,” Dr. Berkowitz said, adding, “This wrinkle-free, ageless face becomes totally normalized. We expect it and then we view that as beautiful.”Are there downsides to using Botox when you’re young?Botox is expensive, and repeated procedures add up. The average cost of a treatment is $466, according to the report.“Neurotoxin injections are a huge cash cow for dermatology offices,” said Valerie Monroe, the former beauty director at O, The Oprah Magazine and the author of a Substack newsletter on beauty.Alternatives do exist. Many doctors pointed to sunscreen or retinols, which can increase collagen in the skin and work to counteract the visible effects of aging.And few women in their 20s and 30s have deep, static lines, which means they have little use for the so-called preventative injections. If you’re considering Botox in your 30s, seek a dermatologist who will talk to you about why you want the treatment. Sometimes, dermatologists will suggest patients wait.Dr. David A. Colbert, the co-founder and head physician of the New York Dermatology Group, said he worries that some patients have internalized damaging messages about aging and beauty.“It’s a pretty toxic, heavy message,” he said. “People don’t even really analyze it anymore. They’re just like: ‘I can’t get too many wrinkles or I just will look awful.’”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySite Information Navigation© 2022 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsAccessibilityWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapCanadaInternationalHelpSubscriptions",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/22/well/live/preventative-botox-wrinkles.html,,3/22/2022

Anyone can read what you share.Give this article44Read in appCredit...Getty ImagesBy Karen WeintraubJune 2, 2017Q. Do air-conditioners cause sinus congestion?A. Yes, air-conditioners can make some people’s noses clog or run, for several reasons.First, walking into a cold, dry room can trigger a runny nose, just as walking outside on a cold winter day drives many people to reach for tissues, said Dr. John Ohman, chief of the division of allergy at Tufts Medical Center in Boston. The cold air seems to trigger nervous system reflexes in the nose that cause glands in the nasal membranes to produce mucus; the problem may be particularly common in those with allergies. But changes in temperature and humidity should trigger only brief congestion, Dr. Ohman said.Those with allergies might develop congestion because small particles like pollen, mold spores, pollutants and dust mites can get trapped by air-conditioning filters and then released into the air when the machine is turned on, said Dr. Maria Garcia-Lloret, an allergist at the U.C.L.A. School of Medicine. Pollutants and bacteria wouldn’t cause an allergic reaction per se, she said, but could irritate the nose. Exposure to mold spores can cause allergic reactions that may be particularly long-lasting.Dr. Richard Lebowitz, a rhinologist at NYU Langone Medical Center, emphasized the importance of changing air-conditioning filters regularly. “If you don’t maintain them well and everything you breathe is filtering through this gigantic sheet of dust,” dispelling dust into the air, “that’s not very helpful,” he noted.Air-conditioners with clean filters can actually reduce sinus problems by keeping allergens out of the air, Dr. Lebowitz said.

I know I should be eating whole grains, but what should I look for when in the grocery aisle?A. Nutrition experts recommend that adults aim to eat 48 grams, or three servings, of whole grains per day. Whole grains are high in fiber and other nutrients; as part of a healthy diet, they have been tied to a lower risk of heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, obesity and other health issues. Common examples of a serving include a slice of 100 percent whole-grain bread, a half cup of oatmeal, or a half cup of cooked brown rice.Unfortunately, you won’t find whole-grain servings listed on the Nutrition Facts panel on packaged foods. But there are a few reliable ways to identify whole-grain foods.First, you can look on food packages for the whole grains stamp, created by the Oldways Whole Grains Council, a consumer advocacy group.“We created the whole grains stamp in 2005 because we knew how challenging it could be to identify products that contain significant amounts of whole grain and wanted to give consumers an easy tool that they could use to locate whole grain items when shopping,” said Caroline G. Sluyter, program director of the Whole Grains Council.With its characteristic yellow background and perforated edges that resemble a postal stamp, the whole grains stamp comes in three versions, with decreasing levels of whole grains:100 Percent Whole Grain: Of the grain in the product, all of it is whole grain. Must have a minimum of 16 grams per serving, which is equivalent to one serving of whole grains.50 Percent Plus Whole Grain: Of the grain in the product, at least half is whole grain. Must have a minimum of 8 grams per serving, equivalent to a half serving of whole grains.Whole Grain: Of the grain in the product, less than half is whole grain. These foods also must provide at least 8 grams of whole grains per serving, but proportionally it might contain more refined grain than whole.The Whole Grains Council has approved use of the stamp for over 13,000 products in 61 countries. But not all whole-grain products use the stamp, and not all whole-grain products, including those found in the bulk section, come in packages.Another good way to ensure there’s a significant level of whole grain in a product is to check whether the first (or at least the second) ingredient in the ingredients list is a whole grain. Ingredients are listed in descending order by weight, so the first one is particularly important.Whole grains are made of three main components: the bran and the germ, which are the most nutritious parts, as well as the endosperm. Whole grains retain all three components, so they are eaten intact (such as oats) or milled in a way that retains all three parts (such as whole-wheat flour).Two types of grain are virtually always whole: brown rice and oats. Ancient grains like quinoa and amaranth are very rarely refined so are a solid bet as well.In most other cases, you’ll want to look for the word “whole” in front of the grain, Ms. Sluyter said. Even grains like sorghum and farro may not necessarily be whole since they are frequently pearled. This means that manufacturers polish off the outer bran layer, in order to make a product that cooks faster. Checking for the word “whole” is especially important in the case of “whole wheat,” such as in bread, or “whole grain corn,” such as in tortillas, since wheat and corn are so often refined. (Popcorn, though, is an automatic whole grain, since the entire kernel gets popped.)Another good strategy when looking to get your whole grains is to see if the front of the package notes the number of grams of whole grains or the percentage (ideally 100 percent, such as “100 percent whole wheat”).Labels to ignore when hunting for whole grains:Multigrain: It could mean a mix of whole grains, a mix of refined grains, or some amount of each. Since the label alone doesn’t specify, it’s best not to rely on this term.Made with whole grain: Again, too ambiguous. This label doesn’t set any threshold for how much of the grain is whole, so it could be just trace amounts.Stone-ground: Like “multigrain,” this label doesn’t tell you anything about whether the grains are whole or refined. It’s about the type of mill — in this case, two big stones grinding together, as opposed to more common steel roller mills — used to make the flour.Organic: The organic label applies to farming and production practices and doesn’t tell you whether a product contains whole grains.Certain additional words and phrases are a tipoff that the product is not whole grain: “wheat flour” without the word “whole” in front of it; “enriched flour”; or, when an ingredient indicates that one of the main parts of the grain is missing, such as “degerminated corn meal.”The Dietary Guidelines for Americans advises that you make sure at least half of the total grains you eat each day are whole. Now that you know what to look for, the best strategy may be to make whole grains your default.Do you have a health question?

Within a few days of bringing them home from the farmer’s market or grocery store, it’s common to find that some gray or white fuzz has staked a claim to a berry or two, prompting many to wonder: Are the rest safe to eat?Food safety experts say that while you shouldn’t eat berries that are obviously moldy, those without visible signs of the spores are fine to eat. And luckily, unlike other food safety concerns that may be invisible to the naked eye, berries with mold growth are easy to spot, said Benjamin Chapman, a professor and food safety specialist at North Carolina State University. (Botanically minded readers may note that many fruits commonly known as berries, including strawberries, raspberries and blackberries, aren’t true berries, but we will describe them as such for the sake of simplicity.)If his basket or clamshell is tainted by one or two moldy berries, “I don’t throw out the whole thing,” Dr. Chapman said. Instead, he tosses the moldy ones and carefully inspects adjoining berries for fuzz, which often appears around a bruise or the site of stem attachment. With the rest, he tries to eat them soon, because lingering mold spores may spread and develop more fuzz in a day or two.Molds are a type of fungi that, when viewed under a microscope, often “look like skinny mushrooms,” according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. They grow threadlike roots that invade the interior of the food, and tiny stalks topped with spores on the surface. Certain types of molds produce toxins that can be harmful if eaten, and in some people, molds can trigger allergic reactions, Dr. Chapman said.The good news for berry eaters is that the molds commonly found on them “are actually not known to produce toxins, like some fungi do, and so there’s less risk,” said Elizabeth Mitcham, a professor and director of the Postharvest Technology Center at the University of California, Davis. Foods that have been found to grow these more dangerous molds include nuts, grains and apples, she said.Because molds on berries are usually innocuous, even accidentally eating a moldy berry — though not recommended — would be unlikely to make you sick, Dr. Mitcham said. Also, “you would probably spit it out before you managed to swallow it,” because moldy berries “have a very off, very bad flavor,” she added.Mold is a common enemy of berry growers and sellers, so it’s not surprising to find it in your berry basket, Dr. Mitcham said. Mold spores are ubiquitous in the environment; they can be carried by air or water and live in the soil of farm fields. The spores typically infect a berry plant’s flowers or fruit and then lie dormant until the fruit fully ripens. Given enough time, those spores will eventually germinate and can spread to adjoining fruits, especially in warmer temperatures, Dr. Mitcham said.Because mold spores are so pervasive, they’re probably present in small amounts on most fresh produce you eat. “I’m likely consuming mold spores all the time, and those mold spores are not making me sick,” Dr. Chapman said.Molds become more dangerous when they grow and invade deeper into the food product, where some types produce toxins. While this isn’t usually a problem with berries because of their shape, small size and the types of molds that grow on them, it is a greater concern with larger foods that are moist or have a soft or porous texture, like leftover meats or casseroles, jams and jellies, soft cheeses and breads. If there is mold on the surface of these foods, you should assume they are contaminated within and throw them away, according to the U.S.D.A.Before buying berries, inspect them carefully and avoid purchasing any with even slight signs of mold, Dr. Chapman said. At home, do another quick check and remove any fruit that is visibly moldy; then refrigerate the rest as soon as possible, Dr. Mitcham said. Don’t wash berries until just before you plan to eat them or cook with them, because moisture encourages mold growth, she added.Mold spores can settle and survive on surfaces, so it’s a good idea to clean your fridge regularly “to break the mold spore cycle,” Dr. Chapman said. The U.S.D.A. recommends cleaning the inside of your fridge with a tablespoon of baking soda dissolved in a quart of water every few months. And if you discover food that’s “egregiously moldy” in your fridge, you might decide that “Yep, today’s the day that I’m going to clean it out,” to prevent too many spores from making themselves at home and spreading to other foods, he added.Alice Callahan is a health and science journalist.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySite Information Navigation© 2022 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsAccessibilityWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapCanadaInternationalHelpSubscriptions",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/07/well/eat/berry-mold-spoil-box.html,,3/7/2022

Anyone can read what you share.Give this article234Read in appBy Siobhan RobertsMarch 22, 2022During a workshop last fall at the Vatican, Stanislas Dehaene, a cognitive neuroscientist with the Collège de France, gave a presentation chronicling his quest to understand what makes humans — for better or worse — so special.Dr. Dehaene has spent decades probing the evolutionary roots of our mathematical instinct; this was the subject of his 1996 book, “The Number Sense: How the Mind Creates Mathematics.” Lately, he has zeroed in on a related question: What sorts of thoughts, or computations, are unique to the human brain? Part of the answer, Dr. Dehaene believes, might be our seemingly innate intuitions about geometry.Organized by the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, the Vatican workshop addressed the subject “Symbols, Myths and Religious Sense in Humans Since the First” — that is, since the first humans emerged a couple of million years back. Dr. Dehaene began his slide show with a collage of photographs showing symbols engraved in rock — scythes, axes, animals, gods, suns, stars, spirals, zigzags, parallel lines, dots. Some of the photos he took during a trip to the Valley of Marvels in southern France. These engravings are thought to date back to the Bronze Age, from roughly 3,300 B.C. to 1,200 B.C.; others were 70,000 and 540,000 years old. He also showed a photo of a “biface” stone implement — spherical at one end, triangular at the other — and he noted that humans sculpted similar tools 1.8 million years ago.For Dr. Dehaene, it is the inclination to imagine — a triangle, the laws of physics, the square root of negative 1 — that captures the essence of being human. “The argument I made in the Vatican is that the same ability is at the heart of our capacity to imagine religion,” he recalled recently.He acknowledged, with a laugh, that it is no small leap from imagining a triangle to devising religion. (His own intellectual trajectory entailed a degree in mathematics and a master’s in computer science before becoming a neuroscientist). Nevertheless, he said, “This is what we have to explain: Suddenly there was an explosion of new ideas with the human species.”ImageGeometric shapes appear below the Megaloceros, a giant extinct deer, in the Lascaux, France, cave paintings, which are thought to be 17,000 years old.Credit...AlamyImageAn engraved slab from the Blombos Cave in South Africa, dating to 70,000 years ago.Credit...Album, via AlamyHuman or baboon?Last spring, Dr. Dehaene and his Ph.D. student Mathias Sablé-Meyer published, with collaborators, a study that compared the ability of humans and baboons to perceive geometric shapes. The team wondered: What was the simplest task in the geometric domain — independent of natural language, culture, education — that might reveal a signature difference between human and nonhuman primates? The challenge was to measure not merely visual perception but a deeper cognitive process.This line of investigation has a long history, yet is perennially fascinating, according to Moira Dillon, a cognitive scientist at New York University who has collaborated with Dr. Dehaene on other research. Plato believed that humans were uniquely attuned to geometry; the linguist Noam Chomsky has argued that language is a biologically rooted human capacity. Dr. Dehaene aims to do for geometry what Dr. Chomsky did for language. “Stan’s work is truly innovative,” Dr. Dillon said, noting that he uses state-of-the-art tools such as computational models, cross-species research, artificial intelligence and functional M.R.I. neuroimaging techniques.In the experiment, subjects were shown six quadrilaterals and asked to detect the one that was unlike the others. For all the human participants — French adults and kindergartners as well as adults from rural Namibia with no formal education — this “intruder” task was significantly easier when either the baseline shapes or the outlier were regular, possessing properties such as parallel sides and right angles.The researchers called this the “geometric regularity effect” and they hypothesized — it’s a fragile hypothesis, they admit — that this might provide, as they noted in their paper, a “putative signature of human singularity.” (Experiments are ongoing and open to participants online.)With the baboons, regularity made no difference, the team found. Twenty-six baboons — including Muse, Dream and Lips — participated in this aspect of the study, which was run by Joël Fagot, a cognitive psychologist at Aix-Marseille University.The baboons live at a research facility in the South of France, beneath the Montagne Sainte-Victoire (a favorite of Cézanne’s), and they are fond of the testing booths and their 19-inch touch-screen devices. (Dr. Fagot noted that the baboons were free to enter the testing booth of their choice — there were 14 — and that they were “maintained in their social group during testing.”) They mastered the oddity test when training with nongeometric images — picking out an apple, say, among five slices of watermelon. But when presented with regular polygons, their performance collapsed.Fruit, Flower, GeometrySymbols used to test whether baboons can pick out a non-matching symbol within a group.





















By The New York Times | Source: Mathias Sablé-Meyer, Stanislas Dehaene et al.“The results are striking, and there seems indeed a difference between the perception of shapes by humans and baboons,” Frans de Waal, a primatologist at Emory University, said in an email. “Whether this difference in perception amounts to human ‘singularity’ would have to await research on our closest primate relatives, the apes,” Dr. de Waal said. “It is also possible, as the authors argue (and reject), that humans live in an environment where right angles matter, whereas baboons do not.”Probing further, the researchers tried to replicate the performance of humans and baboons with artificial intelligence, using neural-network models that are inspired by basic mathematical ideas of what a neuron does and how neurons are connected. These models — statistical systems powered by high-dimensional vectors, matrices multiplying layers upon layers of numbers — successfully matched the baboons’ performance but not the humans’; they failed to reproduce the regularity effect. However, when researchers made a souped-up model with symbolic elements — the model was given a list of properties of geometric regularity, such as right angles, parallel lines — it closely replicated the human performance.These results, in turn, set a challenge for artificial intelligence. “I love the progress in A.I.,” Dr. Dehaene said. “It’s very impressive. But I believe that there is a deep aspect missing, which is symbol processing” — that is, the ability to manipulate symbols and abstract concepts, as the human brain does. This is the subject of his latest book, “How We Learn: Why Brains Learn Better Than Any Machine … for Now.”Yoshua Bengio, a computer scientist at the University of Montreal, agreed that current A.I lacks something related to symbols or abstract reasoning. Dr. Dehaene’s work, he said, presents “evidence that human brains are using abilities that we don’t yet find in state-of-the-art machine learning.”That’s especially so, he said, when we combine symbols while composing and recomposing pieces of knowledge, which helps us to generalize. This gap could explain the limitations of A.I. — a self-driving car, for instance — and the system’s inflexibility when faced with environments or scenarios that differ from the training repertoire. And it’s an indication, Dr. Bengio said, of where A.I. research needs to go.Dr. Bengio noted that from the 1950s to the 1980s symbolic-processing strategies dominated the “good old-fashioned A.I.” But these approaches were motivated less by the desire to replicate the abilities of human brains than by logic-based reasoning (for example, verifying a theorem’s proof). Then came statistical A.I. and the neural-network revolution, beginning in the 1990s and gaining traction in the 2010s. Dr. Bengio was a pioneer of this deep-learning method, which was directly inspired by the human brain’s network of neurons.His latest research proposes expanding the capabilities of neural-networks by training them to generate, or imagine, symbols and other representations.It’s not impossible to do abstract reasoning with neural networks, he said, “it’s just that we don’t know yet how to do it.” Dr. Bengio has a major project lined up with Dr. Dehaene (and other neuroscientists) to investigate how human conscious processing powers might inspire and bolster next-generation A.I. “We don’t know what’s going to work and what’s going to be, at the end of the day, our understanding of how brains do it,” Dr. Bengio said.To know a triangleThe French mathematician René Descartes reckoned that “we could never know the geometric triangle through the one we see traced on paper if our mind had not had the idea of it elsewhere.” Dr. Dehaene and Mr. Sablé-Meyer borrow this sentiment in the epigraph of a new study, currently under review, wherein they try to pin down that cognitive “elsewhere” — offering theories and empirical evidence of what “elsewhere” might be.Building on research originating in the 1980s, they propose a “language of thought” to explain how geometric shapes might be encoded in the mind. And in a fittingly circuitous twist, they find inspiration in computers.“We postulate that when you look at a geometric shape, you immediately have a mental program for it,” Dr. Dehaene said. “You understand it, inasmuch as you have a program to reproduce it.” In computational terms, this is called program induction. “It’s not trivial,” he said. “It’s a big problem in artificial intelligence — to induce a program to do a certain thing from its input and output. In this case, it’s just an output, which is the drawing of the shape.”In tackling such questions, Josh Tenenbaum, a computational cognitive scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an author of the new paper under review, likes to ask: How do we humans manage to extract so much from so little — so little data, time, energy? His approach is to solve the puzzle of these inductive leaps.“Instead of being inspired by simple mathematical ideas of what a neuron does, it’s inspired by simple mathematical ideas of what thinking is,” he said; the distinction is one of hardware versus software, essentially. It’s an approach motivated by the British mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing, among others, and the notion that thinking is a kind of programming.With this new study, Dr. Dehaene and Mr. Sablé-Meyer began by proposing a programming language for drawing shapes. But the novelty, Mr. Sablé-Meyer said, wasn’t in simply proposing the language — “there must be thousands of them by now, starting with Logo in the ’60s and a whole lot of derivative turtle graphics” — but rather in devising a language that mimics our human competence for geometry.The language is made up of geometric primitives, including basic building blocks of shapes, as well as rules that dictate how these can be combined to produce symmetries and patterns. The ultimate goal, however, in inventing such a language isn’t merely drawing, Mr. Sablé-Meyer said; it’s in developing “a good candidate theory for cognition” — a plausible theory for how thoughts, or computations, are processed in the mind.ImagePetroglyphs at Mount Bégo, Valley of Marvels, in southern France.Credit...Stanislas Dehaene ImageA spiral stone engraving on Signal Hill in Saguaro NationalPark, Arizona, dated 550 to 1,550 years ago.Credit...John Cancalosi/AlamyNext the researchers used an A.I. algorithm called DreamCoder, developed a few years ago by Kevin Ellis when he was a Ph.D. student working with Dr. Tenenbaum; he is now a computer scientist at Cornell University and an author of the new study. DreamCoder modeled how the mind might use the programming language in optimally processing shapes: the algorithm finds, or learns, the shortest possible program for any given shape or pattern. The theory is that the mind operates in much the same way.Geometric LanguageResearchers developed a programming language to generate shapes of increasing complexity. The theory is the brain similarly encodes shapes as programs in a language.











At right, shapes found across many cultures include lines, circles, spirals, zigzags, squares and squares of circles.

During one test, they measured how long it took people to memorize a shape such as a squiggly curve, compared with how long it took to find that shape among a collection of six similar squiggles (called the match-to-sample test). The researchers found that the more complex a shape and the longer the program, the more difficulty a subject had remembering it or discriminating it from others.The baboons are trying this test now. But beyond these behavioral studies, the researchers hope to probe even deeper into symbolic thought — at Dr. Dehaene’s NeuroSpin neuroimaging lab, with functional M.R.I.s that measure neural activity while subjects entertain geometric confections. Dr. Dehaene already has some data showing that the brain regions involved — in the prefrontal and parietal lobes — overlap with those known to be associated with the human “number sense.”The brain areas that light up for the language of geometry are what Dr. Dehaene and his former Ph.D. student, Marie Amalric, now a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard, called the math-responsive network. “They are very different from the classical regions activated by spoken or written language, such as Broca’s area,” he said.Language is often assumed to be the quality that demarcates human singularity, Dr. Dehaene noted, but perhaps there is something that is more basic, more fundamental.“We are proposing that there are languages — multiple languages — and that, in fact, language may not have started as a communication device, but really as a representation device, the ability to represent facts about the outside world,” he said. “That’s what we are after.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySite Information Navigation© 2022 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsAccessibilityWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapCanadaInternationalHelpSubscriptions",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/22/science/geometry-math-brain-primates.html?action=click&module=Well&pgtype=Homepage&section=Science,,3/22/2022

Inside was something new, meant to encourage society to consider its obligation to uncountable future generations.The opening in the rock face led to something called the Clock of the Long Now. It’s housed in a 500-foot-tall cylindrical space, hollowed out inside the mountain, and is designed to keep time without human intervention — for 10,000 years.Mr. Brand is the president of the Long Now Foundation, and the work grew out of his desire to focus on what he calls long-term responsibility and thinking. But the clock itself is possible because of the largess of the foundation’s largest benefactor, Jeff Bezos, one of the world’s richest people.The clock is still under construction. But when it is complete, it will represent the longest of long-term thinking, made possible by money from a man who provides near instantaneous satisfaction with one-click shopping.Mr. Brand was at the forefront of predicting the world that made a fortune like Mr. Bezos’ possible — a place where technology connected everyone.His writing, ideas and the community he created in Menlo Park, Calif., in the late 1960s were an integral part of the forces that coalesced in the region that would be named Silicon Valley in 1971.Mr. Brand’s biggest innovation, though, may be the way he has taught people to look at the world.In the 1960s he put an image of planet Earth on “The Whole Earth Catalog,” which became a bible for the baby boom generation. It won the National Book Award in 1972 and sold three million copies in the first three years after publication. Modeled in part on the L.L. Bean catalog, it was originally intended as a source for Mr. Brand’s friends who were going back to the land. Instead, it touched a nerve and became a manual for reinvention for an entire generation — including Apple’s Steve Jobs.In 2005, Mr. Jobs gave a commencement address at Stanford, cited Mr. Brand as a major influence in his life and explained what “Whole Earth” was to a younger generation: “It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along,” he said. “It was idealistic, and overflowing with neat tools and great notions.”Mr. Brand coined the term “personal computer” in 1974, several years after writing an article for Rolling Stone that drew a picture of the future of the digital world. Computers, he predicted, would be the next important trend after psychedelic drugs: “That’s good news, maybe the best since psychedelics. It’s way off the track of the ‘Computers — Threat or menace?’ school of liberal criticism but surprisingly in line with the romantic fantasies of the forefathers of the science,” he wrote.Now Mr. Brand, considered by many to be one of the nation’s pre-eminent futurists, is busy helping to build that 10,000-year clock — a path toward what he believes will be a long-term future for civilization.Mr. Brand has long had an eerie knack for being able to spot trends early on or show up in the midst of them like some high-I.Q. Forrest Gump, only to leave for the next big thing just when everyone else catches up.For example, in 1967, just when many of his friends were going back to the land to found communes, Mr. Brand arrived squarely in the middle of the region soon to be named Silicon Valley. In his journal at the time, he wrote that he was living in Menlo Park “with the intent to let my technology happen here.”His “Whole Earth Catalog” was subtitled “Access to Tools,” and recently, as the national zeitgeist soured on Silicon Valley, a wide variety of authors, including Franklin Foer in “World Without Mind,” Jill Lepore in “These Truths” and Jonathan Taplin in “Move Fast and Break Things,” have all pointed to Mr. Brand as the original technological utopian. His words and ideas, they argue, seduced and inspired the engineers who created the modern digital world.Mr. Brand, who considers himself a relentless pragmatist, winces at the label. “All utopias are dystopias,” he said during a conversation this month in the ramshackle office he has inhabited on the Sausalito, Calif., waterfront since the early 1970s.“The utopians say: ‘I figured it out, I’ve got a system. I’ve got a plan. It’s really going to work now. We’ve just got to get people to understand and appreciate it and then abide by the plan.’” That was not, he emphasized, how he thought.However, he has remained unwavering in his optimism about the future. Today, at 83, Mr. Brand no longer tracks the computing world as closely as he once did. At the same time, he has not backed away from his certainty that humanity’s future lies in our ability to develop technology: New tools to address the challenges of everything from climate change to repairing the threat that social media has posed to democracies.In the past decade he has focused on two things — the Clock of the Long Now and Revive & Restore, a project that he created with his wife, Ryan Phelan, in 2012 to support efforts to protect endangered species, and possibly revive extinct ones, using advanced technologies.He has recently begun advocating the idea of “intended consequences” — a term coined by Ms. Phelan and the Revive & Restore organization — as an antidote to the widely shared fear about the unintended consequences of new technologies.Mr. Brand was closely associated with the emergence of the environmental movement in the 1960s, but he has found himself at odds with it, as it has often been opposed to technologies that he favors.ImageMr. Brand in Sausalito, Calif., in 2016.Credit...Mark Maheny/ReduxWhen he first arrived in Sausalito in the 1970s, he started CoEvolution Quarterly. The idiosyncratic periodical once published a cover story about the possibility of building space colonies, in the process horrifying some of its loyal readers, who believed passionately that the human species should repair the damage it had done on earth before heading to space.That type of work led many to label Mr. Brand a futurist, a category that in the 1980s and 1990s became closely associated with Silicon Valley’s generally rosy view of the world.Mr. Brand, however, shies away from futurism, preferring the idea of “long-term thinking.”“If you change your perspective from futurist to long-term thinking, everything gets better,” he said. “Because long-term thinking invites you to consider at least an equal amount of past to whatever amount of future you’re considering.”Mr. Brand’s optimism can on occasion prove a stumbling block. He saw the dark side of online anonymity in the early 1980s and attempted to design a virtual gathering place that he called the Whole Earth ’Lectronic Link, or the WELL. He envisioned it as a convivial community that would avoid the pitfalls presented by the new world of virtual gathering places.In 1985 he told KQED Focus magazine: “Computers suppress our animal presence. When you communicate through a computer, you communicate like an angel.”Sadly, that very quickly was shown to be untrue on almost every level. Although at the time, that optimism — technology only made people better — was a viewpoint widely shared by a generation of computer network pioneers.Six years later, after being repeatedly and personally attacked over problems with WELL, he quit the board in disgust.He remains sanguine, however, about the potential for fixing the daunting problems that modern online communities have faced.“The opprobrium that came on Twitter and Facebook and so on has sort of paid off,” he said. “They are putting serious time and money and people into trying to alleviate the worst offenses.”Mr. Brand learned to avoid making specific predictions about the future in 2002, when he toured the nuclear waste storage facility in Yucca Mountain.Through the 1990s Mr. Brand opposed nuclear power, but he began to rethink his opposition after he discovered, during that tour, that some experts believed some new nuclear technologies would be found to use what is now considered nuclear waste. That changed the way he thought about the future in general.“It showed us that long-term thinking is at its best, not in terms of long-term planning century by century or utopian planning,” he said. “But you’re trying to keep all the kinds of options that are currently available open — don’t lose options. What progress consists of is adding more options.”Mr. Brand opened the original “Whole Earth Catalog” by writing, “We are as Gods and we might as well get good at it.” In his 2007 book, “Whole Earth Discipline,” he modified his call to arms: “We are as Gods and HAVE to get good at it.” His book endorsed nuclear power, genetically modified crops, dense cities and geoengineering.The book was greeted by many environmentalists with outrage, and many still view him as a turncoat.Nonetheless he has held fast to his view that nuclear power will be necessary to make the transition away from fossil fuels. At the same time, he acknowledges that he has been surprised by the rapid progress being made in other sustainable technologies. Solar got better faster than he ever expected, he said, as did battery capacity. In the end, for Mr. Brand it remains a question of perspective.Not long ago he tweeted: “Interesting: how much bad news is anecdotal and good news is statistical. (And how invisible the statistical is.) Still, if only one of the two can be good news, I would rather it be the statistical. It accumulates toward qualitative change that lasts.”John Markoff, who reported on science and technology for The Times from 1988 to 2017, is the author of “Whole Earth: The Many Lives of Stewart Brand,” from which this article is partially adapted.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySite Information Navigation© 2022 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsAccessibilityWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapCanadaInternationalHelpSubscriptions",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/23/technology/stewart-brand-tech-personal-computer.html?action=click&module=Well&pgtype=Homepage&section=Technology,,3/23/2022

It was advising President Reagan more than four decades ago.The memo was prescient. That Soviet-era pipeline, the subject of a bitter fight during the Reagan administration, marked the start of Europe’s heavy dependence on Russian natural gas to heat homes and fuel industry. However, those gas purchases now help fund Vladimir V. Putin’s war machine in Ukraine, despite worldwide condemnation of the attacks and global efforts to punish Russia financially.In 1981, Reagan imposed sanctions to try to block the pipeline, a major Soviet initiative designed to carry huge amounts of fuel to America’s critical allies in Europe. But he swiftly faced stiff opposition — not just from the Kremlin and European nations eager for a cheap source of gas, but also from a powerful lobby close to home: oil and gas companies that stood to profit from access to Russia’s gargantuan gas reserves.In a public-relations and lobbying blitz that played out across newspaper opinion pages, congressional committees and a direct appeal to the White House, industry executives and lobbyists fought the sanctions. “Reagan has absolutely no reason to forbid this business,” Wolfgang Oehme, chairman of an Exxon subsidiary with a stake in the pipeline, said at the time.Those efforts, nearly a half-century ago, show how some of the world’s largest oil and gas companies played a critical role in opening up Russia’s reserves by opposing sanctions and advocating for business interests over national security, human rights or environmental concerns.Today, Europe’s reliance on Russia’s gas has put European nations in a compromised position: They continue to purchase Russian energy, transferring enormous sums of money to Moscow, which fund a Russian invasion that they denounce.Reagan’s effort to block the pipeline decades ago, which ultimately failed, also laid the foundations for a huge build-out of natural gas, which is now hindering Europe’s attempts to tackle climate change. Even as natural gas has helped to replace dirtier coal, the pipelines and other gas infrastructure that followed have effectively committed Europe to a reliance on gas that not only continues today, but remains difficult to unravel even in a moment of global unity against Russian aggression.“The Soviet Union is a superpower that really emerged on the back of its oil and gas exports,” said Agnia Grigas, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and an expert on the security and energy issues of Russia and the former Soviet states. “Nothing has changed.”ImagePipes that were intended for use in the Nord Stream 2 project, a pipeline that was halted becasue of Russia’s attack on Ukraine.Credit...Odd Andersen/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesIn the face of opposition both at home and abroad, Reagan in 1982 reversed the sanctions, which had stopped American companies from supplying or participating in the project. The pipeline from Siberia to West Germany opened two years later.The industry lobbying has continued to this day.In 2014, when the Obama administration imposed sanctions against Russia following its military seizure of the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine, Exxon fought the measures, meeting with White House officials.The Biden Administration’s Environmental AgendaPresident Biden is pushing stronger regulations, but faces a narrow path to achieving his goals in the fight against global warming.Clean Energy: President Biden wants to eliminate planet-warming emissions from the power sector by 2035, but the nation’s biggest federal utility is betting on gas.Tailpipe Standards: The administration is moving to introduce new limits on pollution from heavy trucks and restore California’s ability to set its own rules on auto emissions.Air Pollution: The administration recently restored regulations on the release of mercury, a neurotoxin linked to developmental damage in children, from coal-burning power plants.Wastewater Projects: The infrastructure bill includes funding to upgrade sewer and drainage systems. Will the money go where it’s most needed?Taming Wildfires: A plan by the administration to reduce the danger of fires is aiming to make forests more resilient through thinning and intentional burning.As Russia this year massed troops on the Ukrainian border, the American Petroleum Institute, the powerful industry group, lobbied against tougher sanctions, saying that any measures needed to be “as targeted as possible in order to limit potential harm to the competitiveness of U.S. companies.”In the wake of Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, Shell, BP and Exxon have said they will end their Russian operations.Casey Norton, a spokesman for Exxon, said the company “does not advocate for or against sanctions” but had communicated with the U.S. government “to provide information about the potential impacts on energy markets and investments.” He said that Exxon was complying with all sanctions, had discontinued its flagship project in Russia and was withholding new investment there.Bethany Williams, an American Petroleum Institute spokeswoman, said that any interactions by its members with policymakers on sanctions had been limited to “ensuring retaliatory measures are clearly written to reduce any room for uncertainty and ensure maximum compliance.”John Murphy, senior vice president for international policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said his organization had a longstanding belief that sanctions would very likely fail if they were unilateral. Exxon, the American Petroleum Institute and the Chamber of Commerce all condemned Russia’s invasion. Shell and BP had no comment.The concerns raised during the Reagan administration four decades ago have been borne out. Before Russia’s attack on Ukraine last month, Germany relied on Russia for 55 percent of its gas, for example, complicating Europe’s response to Russian aggression in Ukraine.For Ukraine, the consequences have been devastating. “The companies that have been working with the Russian regime were driven only by pure financial interest,” said Oleg Ustenko, a top adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky. “They closed their eyes to the morality of it, and now we are paying the consequences.”Parallels in HistoryImageVladimir V. Putin, then prime minister, and  Gazprom chief executive Alexey B. Miller during a  2009  dispute in which Russia shut off supplies to Europe.Credit...Mikhail Metzel/Associated PressOn a frigid Sunday morning in December 1981, millions of Poles woke up to find their country under a state of martial law. Global condemnation of the Polish authorities, and of their backers in the Kremlin, was swift.Already wary of the Soviets’ plan to build a gas pipeline to Western Europe, the Reagan administration produced a list of economic sanctions that essentially banned American companies from helping to build it. “The fate of a proud and ancient nation hangs in the balance,” Reagan said in his Christmas address.The measure drew immediate ire from America’s European allies, where the $25 billion pipeline promised a stable source of gas at a time nations were still reeling from the oil shocks of the 1970s. But within the United States, it was the oil and gas lobby that fought back.The sanctions would “aggravate further our international reputation for commercial reliability,” the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which represented major oil and gas companies and pipeline manufacturers among numerous other industries, warned in a letter to the White House. The pipeline would, in fact, give Western Europe “a degree of leverage over the Soviets rather than vice versa,” Richard Lesher, the group’s president, later told The Washington Post.Following intense lobbying, the House Foreign Affairs Committee voted to lift the sanctions, despite a letter from Secretary of State George P. Shultz warning that such legislation would “severely cripple” the administration’s ability to deal with the Polish crisis.That battle four decades ago marked the start of a huge build-out of gas infrastructure in Europe. Today, an extensive network of pipelines stretches from Russia to Europe, supplying about 40 percent of the continent’s gas.That network has given Moscow leverage over its European neighbors. In 2009, when Russia and Ukraine became embroiled in a diplomatic dispute, Russia shut off its gas supplies, leaving tens of thousands of homes without heat. More than a dozen people froze to death, mainly in Poland, before Russia reopened its pipelines.An abundant flow of gas from Russia had consequences beyond security, slowing Europe’s efforts to tackle climate change by shifting toward renewables, experts say. The European Union has said it now aims to reduce its gas imports by two-thirds, and quickly ramp up its use of wind, solar and other forms of renewable energy.“Obviously they could have done that before, but there was no incentive to,” said Margarita Balmaceda, professor of diplomacy and international relations at Seton Hall University and an associate at the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute. Access to Russia’s gas, she said, had “definitely slowed the move toward renewables.”Ties to Russia BlossomImageMr. Putin and   Exxon  chairman Rex Tillerson, wearing the Order of Friendship, a Russian state decoration, in St. Petersburg in 2013.Credit...Mikhail Klimentyev/TASS, via AlamyThe fossil fuel companies’ early involvement in the Siberian pipeline was also the start of a courtship of a region with some of the world’s largest reserves of oil, natural gas and other commodities. Following the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, successive U.S. administrations also traded their vigilance for an increasingly warm embrace of Moscow, pushing for closer energy ties. (In 2001, President George W. Bush famously said that he had looked Mr. Putin in the eye and got a sense of his soul, comments he later said he regretted.)Spurred by a thaw in East-West relations, fossil fuel companies pursued joint ventures to develop Russia’s oil and gas fields with Russia’s state-controlled oil and gas giants. BP took a nearly 20 percent stake in Rosneft, the Russian oil giant, that accounted for a third of BP’s oil and gas production and more than half its reserves. Shell teamed with Gazprom, the state-owned gas company, to work on projects including Russia’s first liquefied natural gas plant, and invested in the Nordstream 2 gas pipeline.Both BP and Shell say they are now exiting those projects.Exxon, which invested in a gas project near the Pacific island of Sakhalin in the 1990s, in recent years had pursued a heftier stake in Russian oil and gas production, signing a deal with Rosneft for a possible $500 billion investment. A video produced by Rosneft in 2012 portrayed the wide-ranging nature of their planned partnership: joint headquarters in St. Petersburg and Houston, a slice of Exxon’s operations in the Permian Basin in Texas and Gulf of Mexico, and the sharing of fracking and offshore drilling technology.In 2013, Mr. Putin awarded the Exxon chief executive, Rex Tillerson, the Order of Friendship, one of the highest honors Russia gives to foreign citizens.The fallout from Russia’s annexation of the Crimean peninsula the following year forced Exxon to stall the deal, but not without a fight. Even after the United States adopted sanctions, Exxon tried to push ahead with the Rosneft deal, signing legal documents with the state-owned company’s chairman, Igor I. Sechin. Exxon was later fined $2 million for actions the Treasury Department said “demonstrated reckless disregard for U.S. sanctions requirements.”Exxon sued, saying that the U.S. sanctions covered only Mr. Sechin’s personal affairs, not the company he presided over. A Texas judge ruled in favor of Exxon, though the judge called Exxon’s conduct “risky and, perhaps, imprudent.”Exxon also worked to influence Congress’s attempts to pass sanctions against Russia around that time, its lobbying disclosures show. Because of reluctance among some members of Congress to oppose those sanctions, “we had to step in front of that and explain to them how that was hurting U.S. businesses,” Keith McCoy, a former Exxon lobbyist said in a 2021 video released as part of a sting operation by the environmental group Greenpeace.As recently as January 2022, the American Petroleum Institute lobbied to soften sanctions against Russia, saying they should be targeted to limit the damage to American businesses.At his confirmation hearing to become Secretary of State under former President Donald J. Trump, Mr. Tillerson, the Exxon chief executive, stated that he had “never lobbied against sanctions personally” and that “to my knowledge, Exxon never directly lobbied against sanctions.”Bob Corker, a Republican Senator from Tennessee who was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at the time, interjected, “I think you called me at the time.”Asked about the call this week, Mr. Corker said the two men regularly discussed policy on the phone.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySite Information Navigation© 2022 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsAccessibilityWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapCanadaInternationalHelpSubscriptions",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/23/climate/europe-russia-gas-reagan.html?action=click&module=Well&pgtype=Homepage&section=Climate%20and%20Environment,,3/23/2022

Anyone can read what you share.Give this article129Read in appCredit...Glenn HarveyBy Brian X. ChenMarch 23, 2022First we buy a gadget. For the next few years, the manufacturer releases an occasional software update that fixes bugs and protects us from vulnerabilities. One day, those updates stop coming. According to conventional wisdom, that’s the time to buy a new device.But what if it isn’t?The truth is, upgrades needn’t be so automatic. We can often delay them if we follow some best security practices and take control of our personal tech. After all, it’s unrealistic for everyone to upgrade on a tech company’s schedule — some devices, including expensive Android phones, cease getting software updates after only two years. Not all of us have the time or money to buy new products that regularly.At the same time, we don’t want to hold on to our gadgets so long that they become vulnerable to bugs, cyberattacks and other flaws. Software upgrades are typically necessary for those reasons. Everybody needs to be able to use technology safely to live and work, said Hilary Shohoney, the executive director of Free Geek, a nonprofit that repurposes outdated machines for schools and senior citizens.“We have to ride the line between what the reality is for a lot of people and recognizing that everybody has to engage in the digital world,” she said. “It’s not a fair thing to say you need the best computer to get the best security.”So how do we walk that line? While a new gadget must be bought eventually, there are some ways to keep your devices running safely even when the manufacturer stops providing software updates. Here’s what you need to know.Follow Best Security PracticesConsider how we use technology nowadays. On computers, lots of what we do, from turning in homework to editing spreadsheets, happens through a web browser. On phones, we heavily rely on both the web and apps.So staying safe online without direct help from a manufacturer largely involves taking steps for browsing the web and using apps. Here are some things to pay attention to:Keep your browser up to date. Staying on top of browser updates will offer some protection from malicious websites. Trustworthy browser companies like Mozilla, the maker of Firefox, update their apps to work on computers that are more than 10 years old.As always, avoid suspicious behavior. Don’t open messages or click on links from unknown senders, and, if possible, use only apps offered by trusted brands, said Sinan Eren, an executive at Barracuda Networks, a security firm.Be on the lookout for shady apps. Android devices are more susceptible to malware than Apple phones partly because they can be set up to install apps from unauthorized app stores. In addition, many manufacturers stop supporting Android devices after only two years. Google declined to comment. Owners of outdated Android devices can add a layer of protection by installing a malware-scanning app from brands like Malwarebytes, NortonLifeLock and Lookout.Secure your online accounts. Even if your device’s software is outdated, setting up your online accounts with two-factor authentication — a security practice that generates a unique code via an app or a text message whenever you log in to a site — can help prevent inappropriate access to your account in the event that your password is stolen.Doing all of the above will reduce risk, but won’t eliminate it. Dan Guido, the chief executive of Trail of Bits, an internet security firm, said outdated devices remained wide open for attackers to exploit because of known vulnerabilities inside old software.“Unsupported devices are a stable target — a sitting duck — for attackers,” he said.Install a Different Operating SystemThere are more advanced steps that can keep a device functional and secure past its supported life. One involves replacing the manufacturer’s software system with an alternative.Ms. Shohoney’s nonprofit, Free Geek, based in Portland, Ore., revives old personal computers by installing a copy of Linux, the open-source operating system known for robust security and used for basic tasks like browsing the web, exchanging email and composing documents.Installing a different operating system requires some technical know-how, but myriad resources and tutorials online offer step-by-step instructions for adding Linux to outdated Windows and Mac machines.Smartphone owners have fewer options. For Android, LineageOS, an open-source mobile operating system, has received positive reviews for its robust security.Outdated Apple mobile devices, however, can’t be easily modified to install an alternate operating system. In fact, security experts recommend against “jailbreaking,” or injecting unauthorized software, because it can weaken the Apple device’s security.Repurpose Your Old DeviceWe can also take steps with our hardware, like replacing an aging battery, to keep our devices going. But over time, when the cost, effort and risk add up and make resuscitating a device impractical, upgrading is your best bet.That doesn’t mean we have to haul our devices to a recycling center. By turning off an outdated iPad’s internet connection, for instance, you can safely use it for light tasks like playing music or jotting down recipes, said Kyle Wiens, the chief executive of iFixit, a company that offers tools and instructions on repairing tech products.“If it’s not connected to the net, it doesn’t matter that it’s out of date,” he said.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySite Information Navigation© 2022 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsAccessibilityWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapCanadaInternationalHelpSubscriptions",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/23/technology/personaltech/tech-obsolescence.html?action=click&module=Well&pgtype=Homepage&section=Technology,,3/23/2022

Prognostications about the city’s wellness are ever changing — but this is hardly the first time that New York has weathered dire pronouncements about its vitality as one of the nation’s cultural capitals. The city has prevailed through many reinventions in decades past, and has consistently emerged with its artistic spirit, ingenuity and wellsprings of creativity intact.How did the city’s cultural landscape repair itself after setbacks from the economic and civic tumult in the 1970s, the challenges of crime and crumbling infrastructure in the 1980s and the ravages of the AIDs epidemic on the artistic community in the 1990s? What lessons can the arts leaders and creators of today take from those efforts? The renewal of New York’s cultural landscape is cyclical, resilient and enduring — and yet, what is unique about today’s challenges?In this virtual event, Jazmine Hughes, a Metro reporter for The Times, explored these questions alongside a panel of guests whose work was crucial to the past cycles of the city’s cultural revival. We heard from the writer, activist and historian Sarah Schulman, whose 2021 book, “Let the Record Show,” tells the riveting story of ACT UP and AIDS activism in New York, during a pandemic of a different kind. We were also joined by the legendary artist, musician and multimedia creator Laurie Anderson, whose genre-defying work has for decades been a part of New York’s arts world, providing a visual and aural backdrop to the story of the city. Finally, with a new play, opera, musical and film, Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Lynn Nottage shared insights on being a multi-hyphenate creator in today’s New York City.This event is part of our A City Stirs coverage.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySite Information Navigation© 2022 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsAccessibilityWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapCanadaInternationalHelpSubscriptions",https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/16/nyregion/new-york-city-arts-post-covid.html?action=click&module=Well&pgtype=Homepage&section=Explore%20Times%20Events,,11/16/2021

Anyone can read what you share.Give this article665Read in appBy Ross DouthatOpinion ColumnistOn Sept. 14, 2001, the House of Representatives passed what was understood to be a declaration of war against the perpetrators of the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks, by a vote of 420 to 1. The one dissenter was Barbara Lee, Democrat of California. At the time, her protest vote seemed like embarrassing peacenik nonsense, an example of left-wing folly at a time of moral clarity and necessary war.In recent days, since the invasion of Ukraine, the House has cast votes by similarly lopsided margins — 426 to 3 for a resolution urging various kinds of support for Kyiv, 424 to 8 to suspend normal trade relations with Russia and Belarus. The dissenters this time have been Republicans, a mixture of eccentric libertarians like Thomas Massie of Kentucky and crackpot populists like Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia.Just as I didn’t agree with Barbara Lee’s worldview, I don’t agree with the views that seem to be motivating today’s dissenting votes — and not just in their most paranoid, Greene-ian expressions. As I wrote last week, the Ukraine war has exposed certain limits to populist thinking generally: Organized as it is around the internal failures of Western and American elites, the populist response to a clear external threat has been a kind of anticipatory opposition, a critique of elite mistakes not yet in evidence.The shared populist assumption — on the anti-establishment right, the heterodox left and the new spaces where they intersect — seems to be that the Biden administration is destined to repeat the Bush administration’s War on Terror and Iraq-era mistakes. But so far this White House has taken a more cautious and controlled approach. Certain individual voices in the establishment have pushed for reckless escalation, but no equivalent of the hawkish “uniparty” of the early 2000s has yet reassembled.Instead, President Biden’s team seems to be following a Cold War playbook of cautious proxy war rather than embracing sweeping Bushian ambitions. And for every would-be Curtis LeMay on cable television or in the White House press room, there are noted anti-populists like David French and Tom Nichols warning their readers about the dangers of escalation, the threat of nuclear war.So I’m not here to offer three cheers for Massie or Greene or any other dissenter from our effort to support Ukraine. But having lived through the last two decades of failed American military efforts, and having watched as Lee’s lone vote in 2001 came to seem eventually like an admirable dissent rather than a far-left folly, I want to offer a single cheer, at least, for such dissent in present circumstances.At the very least, it should be possible to disagree with the dissenters provisionally, and to reject the kind of anti-anti-Putinism to which they’re often tempted, without pretending that all the reasons to doubt the wisdom of our foreign policy establishment have suddenly evaporated.Three connected realities, in particular, should guarantee the dissenters a place in the discussion. The first is simply the recent track record of American involvement in military struggles overseas. Since the Cold War’s end, whether we’ve put boots on the ground, dropped bombs or confined ourselves — as in Ukraine, so far — to arming combatants, our record of interventionism features numerous debacles, on the small scale of Somalia and Libya as well as the large scale of the Iraq war, and fewer unalloyed successes. If you made decisions retrospectively and reduced every case to a binary choice, “intervene or stay out,” the side saying “stay out” would generally have the better of the argument.There are excellent reasons — starting with the performance of the Ukrainians themselves — to think that this time is different, that a limited effort in support of the Kyiv government is in the American national interest in the way our bombing campaign in Libya or our endless quest for the “moderate rebels” in Syria wasn’t.But this leads to the second point, which is that dissent can still be important in cases where the interventionists are initially correct. Our decision to topple the Taliban in 2001, for instance, remains the right and necessary call in hindsight, notwithstanding the debacles that followed. But that didn’t make Lee’s dissenting vote any less important — because it anticipated the disaster of our nation-building effort, the over-expansive application of the authorization to use military force, the various abuses of presidential power in the War on Terror.Likewise, in the current moment there’s no way to know for sure whether Thomas Massie’s libertarian warnings about the House’s measures — that they’re overly broad, escalatory and liable to presidential abuse — will be borne out by events. But it’s entirely possible for arming Ukraine to be good policy and for Massie to be right that some elements of the American response to Russian aggression could go badly or disastrously astray.Finally, dissent matters because the potential scale of a disastrous outcome in a conflict with Russia is so much greater than even the worst-case scenarios in other recent wars. Let’s say, for the sake of argument, that because of the Biden administration’s caution, there’s only a 5 percent chance that our support for Ukraine leads to unexpected escalation, to the American military’s direct involvement in the war. Whereas if you looked at the Bush administration’s policy toward Iraq in late 2002, you would have said that the odds of a war for regime change in that case were well over 50 percent.On that level, the Biden policy seems much safer for a cautious realist to support. But that hypothetical 5 percent risk carries with it some still-more-fractional risk of nuclear escalation, which is a much more existential danger than even the more disastrous scenarios for Iraq. That has to create its own distinctive set of calculations. Even if the Biden policy is the best course, you still need an unusual level of vigilance, a somewhat hyperactive caution, around the possibility of escalation. And here the anticipatory critique of elite failure that we’re getting from the populists becomes valuable: Not because it will necessarily be vindicated, but because even a small risk of elite folly is worth worrying over when nuclear weapons are potentially involved.For a practical example of that folly from Republican politics, consider the G.O.P. Senate primary in Ohio, where J.D. Vance has been running as a populist traitor to the intelligentsia that helped make his “Hillbilly Elegy” a best seller. (Full disclosure: I used to have long conversations with Vance about the future of the G.O.P., if you’d like to hold me responsible for the tone of his campaign.) That populist pitch has included a strong dose of anti-interventionism, which led him to declare his indifference to “what happens to Ukraine,” relative to domestic concerns, just before Vladimir Putin gave the order to invade.It’s a comment that has been highlighted and condemned by populism’s critics since the invasion, and in the recent Republican Senate debate Vance took predictable fire over the issue. But in the same debate the two candidates who are seemingly ahead of him in the polls, Mike Gibbons and Josh Mandel, both endorsed an improbable halfway kind of escalation — a no-fly zone somehow imposed by Europeans rather than Americans, with the idea that this would thread the needle between thwarting Russia and accidentally starting World War III.It was an idea that only Vance wholeheartedly condemned, and he was right. Under wartime conditions, the escalatory fantasies of his rivals — have our European allies close Ukraine’s skies, and then when they get into a shooting war with Russia, we do … what? — carry a more immediate risk than the dangers of populist indifference, the flaws of isolationist dissent.Dissent, the Bush-era left often proclaimed, is the highest form of patriotism. That may be overly dramatic and self-flattering. But at the very least we can say this much: In a context where elite mistakes and hawkish temptations could have atomic consequences, to read dissenters out of the debate makes the path to destruction much too wide and smooth for comfort.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Anyone can read what you share.Give this article1357Read in appBy Thomas B. EdsallMr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C., on politics, demographics and inequality.As the 2022 midterms draw into view, the question arises: To what degree are Democratic difficulties inevitable?Ruy Teixeira, a co-editor of The Liberal Patriot, argues in an email that “the cultural left has managed to associate the Democratic Party with a series of views on crime, immigration, policing, free speech and, of course, race and gender that are quite far from those of the median voter. That’s a success for the cultural left, but the hard reality is that it’s an electoral liability for the Democratic Party.”Teixeira went on: “The current Democratic brand suffers from multiple deficiencies that make it somewhere between uncompelling and toxic to wide swaths of American voters who might potentially be their allies.”In Teixeira’s view, many Democrats have fallen victim to what he calls the “Fox News fallacy.”“This is the idea,” Teixeira said. “If Fox News criticizes the Democrats for X, then there must be absolutely nothing to X, and the job of Democrats is to assert that loudly and often.” He wrote, “Take the issue of crime. Initially dismissed as simply an artifact of the Covid shutdown that was being vastly exaggerated by Fox News and the like for their nefarious purposes, it is now apparent that the spike in violent crime is quite real and that voters are very, very concerned about it.”In an analysis of the complexity of the current Democratic predicament, Sarah Anzia, a professor of public policy and political science at Berkeley, addressed the preponderance of urban voters in the Democratic coalition: “The Democrats have a challenge rooted in political geography and the institution of single-member, first-past-the-post elections.” Citing Jonathan Rodden’s 2019 book “Why Cities Lose,” Anzia argued that the density of Democratic voters in cities has both geographically isolated the party and empowered its most progressive activist wing:They need to find ways to compete in more moderate or even conservative districts if they hope to have majorities of seats in the U.S. Congress or state legislatures. But large numbers of their voters are concentrated in cities, quite progressive and want the party to move further left in its policy positions — and not just on social-cultural issues.Anzia contended that Democrats “have collectively staked out positions that have alienated certain supporters,” which is “related to the built-in challenge I just described.”















Opinion Debate
Will the Democrats face a midterm wipeout?


Mark Penn and Andrew Stein write that ""only a broader course correction to the center will give Democrats a fighting chance in 2022"" and beyond.
    

Kyle Kondik asks how likely a Democratic comeback will be in an election year where the odds, and history, are not in their favor.
    

Christopher Caldwell writes that a recent poll shows the depths of the party’s troubles, and that “Democrats have been led astray by their Trump obsession.”
    

Ezra Klein speaks to David Shor, who discusses his fear that Democrats face electoral catastrophe unless they shift their messaging.
    








The murder of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter protests in the summer and fall of 2020, Anzia continued,brought policing reform to the agenda in a way that it hadn’t been before, even after Ferguson, but suddenly the conversation jumped to “defund the police.” However one defines the specifics of what that should mean, I do think it sounded extreme and scary to a lot of people outside of places like Berkeley, Seattle, Minneapolis.According to Anzia’s analysis, Democratic elected officials and teachers’ unions weakened the party by closing schools for in-person instruction for too long:It made sense to have remote instruction early in the pandemic, but in many places, kids were in Zoom school until April of 2021 or even until the end of the academic year. Anyone could see that this was going to have some really negative consequences for kids.Multiple studies, Anzia wrote,show that this was more common — schools remained in remote learning longer — in more Democratic places with stronger teachers’ unions. This is an issue that affects people’s lives very directly. It handed Republicans an issue to run on.Some experts in American elections make the case that Joe Biden was elected by voters seeking a return to regular order after the tumultuous Trump years but that instead of steering a moderate course, Biden sought to become a transformative president in the mold of Franklin Roosevelt — the problem being that because his party held razor-thin majorities in Congress, he lacked the mandate to do it.Frances Lee, a political scientist at Princeton, wrote in an email thatthe structural problem here is that Democrats’ success in winning unified party control in the Georgia Senate runoffs in 2021 hugely inflated the expectations of Democratic base voters about what could be achieved. At that time, it was even bandied about that Joe Biden was going to be the next F.D.R. Democrats passed a $3.5 trillion budget resolution that envisioned a transformational domestic policy agenda. But Democrats have not been able to deliver on most of these policy goals.“Democrats,” Lee continued,have not been able to achieve that unanimity on issues of critical importance to the party’s base: voting rights, Build Back Better, minimum wage, police reform. Democratic base voters are very frustrated and disappointed right now. Considering that the policy outcomes of trifecta control of national government have been so disappointing, it is hard to see how Democrats can fire up their base to turn out again. It is difficult to see anything changing on this front between now and the 2022 midterms.Eric Schickler, a political scientist at Berkeley, described the most likely outcome of the 2022 elections as part of “a cycle of disappointment and recrimination” that not only has plagued Biden’s first two years in office but also dogged his two most recent Democratic predecessors — Bill Clinton in 1994 and Barack Obama in 2010.The pattern:Republicans provided unified opposition to Democrats’ agenda, Democrats struggled to corral all of their members behind their program, and the party’s own voters grew frustrated by the disappointing results compared to their expectations.At the moment, there is widespread pessimism among those on the left end of the political spectrum. Isabel V. Sawhill, a senior fellow at Brookings, replying by email to my inquiry, wrote that for predictable reasons, “Democrats face an uphill battle in both 2022 and 2024.”But, she went on, “the problems are much deeper. First, the white working class that used to vote Democratic no longer does.” Sawhill noted that when shestudied this group back in 2018, what surprised me most was their very negative attitudes toward government, their dislike of social welfare programs, their commitment to an ethic of personal responsibility and the importance of family and religion in their lives. This large group includes some people who are just plain prejudiced but a larger group that simply resents all the attention paid to race, gender, sexual preference or identity and the disrespect they think this entails for those with more traditional views and lifestyles.Messages coming from the more progressive members of the Democratic Party, Sawhill warned, “will be exploited by Republicans to move moderate Democrats or to move no-Trump Republicans in their direction.”Sean Westwood, a political scientist at Dartmouth, is highly critical of the contemporary Democratic Party, writing by email:Misguided focus on unpopular social policies are driving voters away from the Democratic Party and are mobilizing Republicans. Democrats used to be the party of the working class, but today they are instead seen as a party defined by ostensibly legalizing property crime, crippling the police and injecting social justice into math classes.As a result, Westwood continued,It is no surprise that this doesn’t connect with a working family struggling to pay for surging grocery bills. By abandoning their core brand, even Democrats who oppose defunding the police are burdened by the party’s commitment to unpopular social policy.The traditional strategy in midterm elections, Westwood wrote, is to mobilize the party base. Instead, he contended, Democratshave decided to let the fringe brand the party’s messaging around issues that fail to obtain majority support among the base. Perhaps the most successful misinformation campaign in modern politics is being waged by the Twitter left against the base of the Democratic Party. The Twitter mob is intent on pushing social policies that have approximately zero chance of becoming law as a test of liberalism. Even if you support reducing taxes on the middle class, immigration reform and increasing the minimum wage, opposing defunding the police or the legalization of property crime makes you an unreasonable outcast.Along similar lines, John Halpin, who works with Teixeira as a co-editor of The Liberal Patriot, emailed to say thatthe biggest problem ahead of the 2022 midterms is that voters don’t think Biden and the Democrats are focused on the issues that matter most to them. If you look at the most recent Wall Street Journal poll, Democrats are currently suffering double-digit deficits compared to Republicans on perceptions about which party is best able to handle nearly all of the issues that matter most to voters: for example, rebuilding the economy (–13), getting inflation under control (–17), reducing crime (–20) and securing the border (–26). Democratic advantages on issues like education are also down considerably from just a few years ago.There are political analysts who differ strongly from Westwood and Teixeira in their critiques of Democratic strategy.Will Bunch, a liberal columnist for The Philadelphia Inquirer, argues that Democrats should adopt a full-speed-ahead, damn-the-torpedoes approach. In a March 3 column, Bunch contended that the Reagan revolution of the 1980s still casts “a cloud of self-doubt over the Democratic Party” and thatparty messaging largely remains dominated by reaction and fear rather than boldness. Those fears seem rooted in a panic that progressive values will be seen as less American — when the reality is that ideas like academic freedom, preventing censorship and a belief in inquiry, including science, are the core beliefs of this nation. It’s past time for President Biden and other leaders of the Democratic Party to approve this message.I asked Bunch how a Democratic candidate should appeal to white working-class voters and socially conservative Black, Hispanic and Asian American voters. He replied by email:The white working class is a much more diverse group than commentators from all sides tend to credit. Remember the large turnouts for Black Lives Matter marches in isolated Rust Belt and rural communities in 2020, for example, and many in the working class remain zealously pro-union. I think the greatest cause of resentment is lack of educational and related career opportunities that have shut out the working class of all races. The Democrats are philosophically wired to expand these opportunities — through free community college and trade school, for example — yet have failed to make these a priority, ensuring a continued sense that Dems are now the party of self-enlightened degree holders looking down on them. That cycle can and must be broken.I also asked how a Democrat should counter Republicans who exploit critical race theory, defunding the police, affirmative action, transgender rights and other politically divisive issues.Bunch replied:It’s important to reframe the conversations, so that the debate about schools, for example, isn’t about critical race theory (a construction that’s only taught in law schools) but about book banning or blocking teachers from discussing even Martin Luther King or Rosa Parks, which most voters in the vast middle vehemently oppose. Likewise, Democrats need to make clear that their goal is making streets safer and ending the heartbreak of homicide, but the way to do that is by thoughtfully building safer communities, not throwing more taxpayer dollars at failed methods of policing. The best strategy on affirmative action, at least in education, is to again make higher ed a public good and eliminate the current “Hunger Games” of college admissions.Dan Froomkin, a media critic who writes at Press Watch, argued in an email that Republicans are using a collection of contrived issues with little substantive merit. On critical race theory, for example, he wrote:It’s a phony issue. What far-right Republicans mean by “critical race theory” is that white children are being taught at public schools that they should be ashamed of being white. This is a made-up issue that serves as a stalking horse for inciting white grievance. Like so many of the far-right accusations against their opponents, it really couldn’t be less true. The reality is that public schools writ large don’t teach nearly enough about the sordid aspects of American history or culture, as you well know. As a press critic, I have been horrified at how credulously many political reporters have written about Republican lies — and how impressed they were at their alleged (but entirely unproven) effectiveness. They wrote about it as if it were a real problem, rather than an obvious, bad-faith attempt to manufacture white panic.The prospect of Democratic losses in the House will have ideological consequences for both parties.Halpin pointed out that the Democrats who lose seats in Congress in 2022 are certain to be disproportionately drawn from the moderates who face the most difficulty winning re-election in purple districts:If the Democrats get clobbered this fall, it will mostly be frontline members — those who are more moderate and centrist — who lose their seats, thus paving the way for a minority Democratic Party to become even more left wing. This would be a disaster for Democrats, but no one in the party seems willing to confront it.Matt Bennett, the executive vice president of Third Way, a centrist Democratic think tank, cited a major difference now compared to past midterm elections, writing in an email:Republicans at every level are openly plotting to steal the presidency in 2024, as we detail here. An essential element of their plot is winning control of Congress. That means the future prospects of both the Democratic Party and American democracy could be severely damaged by a loss in 2022.The congressional Republicans, Bennett continued,who stood up to Trump’s assault on democracy now number in the single digits, and most of them are retiring or likely to lose in primaries. The candidates who would give them their majorities are, almost to a person, fully committed to the big lie that Trump won in 2020. Almost all have run on a set of authoritarian messages that include fear of the mythical deep state, disregard for constitutional and legal protections (other than the Second Amendment) and contempt for vital norms of governing. Worst of all, they have committed themselves to unyielding support for Donald Trump, who has staked his entire postpresidency and comeback effort on an assault on voting. Putting his acolytes in charge of Congress could send us careening toward the cliff, endangering the future of the world’s oldest and sturdiest democracy.Bennett warned:While the economy continues to impact voter behavior most, Republicans have been able to weaponize culture war issues in ways that significantly damage Democrats. In a major retrospective on the 2020 congressional elections that Third Way ran along with the Collective PAC and Latino Victory Fund, we found that Republican attempts to brand Democrats as radicals worked devastatingly well. Of the 12 House Democratic freshmen who lost last cycle — on a ticket with a winning presidential candidate — all were seriously hurt by culture war attacks.This Democratic liability has become acute as politics have become nationalized, making all Democrats pay a price for what a small but prominent group pushes for:Members of Congress on the far left have taken a series of positions — like defunding the police, abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement, closing federal prisons, decriminalizing border crossings, etc. — that are politically toxic in swing districts. It is no longer the case that what happens in a deep blue district, where these kinds of ideas might be more palatable, stays there. The fact is that these kinds of ideas and slogans do create a perception among swing voters that Democrats are outside the mainstream.John Lawrence, who served as an aide in the House for 38 years, including eight as chief of staff to Nancy Pelosi, is the kind of party strategist hardly anyone outside Washington has heard of but who is exceptionally knowledgeable about the state of American politics.Lawrence replied by email to my inquiry:I think a lot of voters will use 2022 to remind Biden (and Democrats, since they can’t vote against him) that their vote in 2020 was a vote to return to normalcy, not a blank check to build on the New Deal and Great Society. Once in office — albeit with ridiculously narrow margins — Democrats used the crisis to swing for the stands, ignoring the historical lesson of the Senate’s moderating role. So they have created the worst of all worlds: a failure to enact what the base demanded (but they did not have the votes to deliver) and the appearance of having overreached and invited an electoral haircut by many 2020 supporters who never embraced such a sweeping agenda.The Russian invasion of Ukraine makes the future highly uncertain not only in Europe but throughout the world. Similarly, if less violently, the state of the economy, inflation and the trajectory of Covid are fuel for dissension and remain unpredictable.The historical pattern of midterm contests suggests that a rejection of the party in power is the customary order of business. But the consequences of a Republican takeover of the House or of both branches of Congress are unlikely to be routine. What we can be sure of is that the Democrats can’t go on forever with this much of a gulf between what the majority of progressive party activists think the party should stand for and what the majority of Americans think it should.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Anyone can read what you share.Give this articleRead in appBy Jessica GroseOpinion WriterFor me, lately, the hardest part of parenting is raising a kid whose personality reflects my own like a mirror. One of my children is a perfectionist and incredibly hard on herself, just like me. My discomfort comes from watching her struggle with the same things I continue to struggle with at 40, and knowing in my heart that these issues may plague her all her life and that there may not be much I can do about it.Here’s a small example of how it plays out for us: She brought a library book with her on our family vacation a few weeks ago and accidentally left it on the plane to Florida. First, she was worried that her school’s librarian would be mad at her. No matter how much we tried to reassure her that she wasn’t the first kid to misplace a library book and that the librarian wouldn’t take it personally, she was still anxious about it for the whole trip, to the point of not sleeping one night.Then, without any prompting from me or my husband, she took money from her allowance and put it in her backpack, preparing herself to pay for the lost book on the Monday she returned to school. (I was proud that she wanted to take ownership but dismayed by her obsession with such a forgivable mistake.) Even though the librarian didn’t really chastise her, and she did pay for the book, my daughter still occasionally mentions the incident, donning the discomfort of that moment just to feel it bristle against her skin.I’m intimately familiar with these feelings, as they’re also what I feel when I make any kind of mistake, and watching my kid experience them is even worse than feeling them myself. It’s not even just knowing that I can’t shield her from that anxiety; it’s also feeling guilty that she inherited my neuroses.The whole episode made me flash back to taking calculus in my senior year of high school, getting a pop quiz I was totally unprepared for and bursting into extremely public and uncontrollable tears. In addition to my embarrassment, I bombed that quiz and remember losing sleep over whether that would mean that I would fail the class, then not get into any colleges, and end up permanently unemployable. It was a fully ridiculous set of catastrophic fears that caused me an unnecessary amount of upset. It’s an avalanche of feelings I would love my daughter not to get buried under.Yet she isn’t going to stop being who she is — nor would I want her to — so the goal for me is to figure out how to support her and also get to a place where my own feelings about her feelings are less overwhelming.One thing I can do, said Ilyse Dobrow DiMarco, a clinical psychologist and the author of “Mom Brain: Proven Strategies to Fight the Anxiety, Guilt, and Overwhelming Emotions of Motherhood — and Relax Into Your New Self,” is to continue to remind myself that even though we’re similar, my kid and I aren’t the same. “We talk in cognitive behavioral therapy about catastrophizing, which is when we assume that catastrophe is going to ensue,” DiMarco explained.We shouldn’t catastrophize about our children’s experiences and assume that what they experience will be as bad as what we have felt in our own lives. Just because my daughter and I have traits in common, my kid has “different circumstances, different schools, different peers and different parents,” DiMarco said.Many kids today have access to mental health resources, DiMarco noted, and are often in environments where talking about feelings is encouraged — something that wasn’t as common when we were growing up decades ago. Though because I was raised by a psychiatrist, we probably talked about feelings more than the typical 1980s family. In fact, my mother was among the first to recognize my daughter’s personality. She might be the only grandmother in history to say about her grandchild, “She has a highly developed superego for a 3-year-old.”Another parenting strategy is just to give myself space to deal with the inevitable pain. “When it’s something that is so closely identified with your own struggles, it makes sense you are not only going to feel their suffering, but re-experience your own childhood, teenagehood or adult suffering,” said Dr. Pooja Lakshmin, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the George Washington University School of Medicine & Health Sciences. I’m usually able to do this; if I find myself getting overwhelmed by my kid’s familiar anxieties, I will try to create some room, once she’s calmed down, to give myself (and her) some mental and physical space.It’s also good to remind myself that the traits I passed down aren’t all bad, Lakshmin added. Along with her perfectionism, my daughter also inherited my snarky sense of humor and the skepticism of a journalist. She has a million questions for the universe and I can answer them only half of the time, but I relish her curiosity and love to talk to her.Lakshmin also said something that she feared might depress me, but it actually made me feel better: “There will be ways in which she will have struggles that are completely different. The place you get in trouble is when you automatically assume that because it was terrible for you, it will be terrible for her in the same way. It will probably be terrible for her in different ways.”A theme that I frequently return to in this newsletter is the ultimate lack of control we have over our kids. We try to offer them a safe haven to return to, but they must experience most of life on their own. This is perhaps the key part of parenting as your children get older — letting them grow away from you, and accepting that their happiness is not completely within your command. I can try to give my daughter strategies for managing her anxieties and be there for her to talk to, but she has to go out there and learn to cope with what’s in her head.My child is going to have much bigger problems in her life than a lost library book — not to mention that a lost book is a tiny problem to have in a world where families are fleeing their homeland and losing everything overnight. She’ll probably handle some of her problems badly, as I have. But I have endured, and I have to have faith that my daughter will, too.Want More on Kids and Personality?Last year, my Times colleague Erik Vance wrote about “the concept of resilience, the ability to engage with a challenge, risk or impediment,” and how to build it up in our kids.What about other people’s kids and their personalities? Last year, I wrote about how to enforce house rules with your kid’s more challenging pals. It was written for remote learning times, but it is applicable to play dates, too.If your kid struggles with perfectionism as both my daughter and I do, in 2020 I offered tips for how to manage it.Tiny VictoriesParenting can be a grind. Let’s celebrate the tiny victories.My child’s list of worries was long and it was getting late. “I’m going to take these worries for you. I’m going to put them in a box for the night. If you want them back in the morning, you can have them, but you don’t need to hold on to them right now. I can hold them,” I said, running my fingers across her eyebrows. She nodded. I pretended to take something from her chest in my hands. I took them away with me. She slept all night.— Laura Wheatman Hill, Lake Oswego, Ore.If you want a chance to get your Tiny Victory published, find us on Instagram @NYTparenting and use the hashtag #tinyvictories; email us; or enter your Tiny Victory at the bottom of this page.

Anyone can read what you share.Give this articleRead in appBy Thomas RidMr. Rid is a professor at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies researching the risks of information technology in conflict.“Cyberwar is coming!”For decades now, we have heard this refrain from the American defense establishment. We were warned that the next big state-on-state military confrontation could start with a flash-bang cyberattack: power outages in major cities, air traffic control going haywire, fighter jets bricked.As Russia started amassing around 100,000 troops along its western and southern borders through 2021, Ukraine seemed to be the ideal battle space for such an apocalyptic scenario. The country has already seen some of the most brazen, shrewd and costly cyberattacks in history over the past eight years: hacks and election interference in 2014 as Russia annexed Crimea, remotely caused blackouts in 2015, devastating ransomware attacks in 2017.In 2022 the war came but seemingly without the cyberapocalypse and waves of pummeling digital strikes we expected. “Cyberattacks on Ukraine Are Conspicuous by Their Absence,” headlined The Economist a week into the war.Such claims, however, are misleading. Cyberwar has come, is happening now and will most likely escalate. But the digital confrontation is playing out in the shadows, as inconspicuous as it is insidious. Several interlocking dynamics of cyberoperations in war stand out from what we have seen in Ukraine so far.First, some cyberattacks are meant to be visible and, in effect, distract from the stealthier and more dangerous sabotage. On Feb. 15 and 16, Ukrainian banks suffered major denial-of-service attacks, meaning their websites were rendered inaccessible. Western authorities swiftly attributed the attacks to Russia’s intelligence service, and Google is now helping protect 150 websites in Ukraine from such attacks. The Anonymous collective declared cyberwar against the Russian government soon after the attack and obtained a trove of data from a German subsidiary of Rosneft, a major Russian state-owned oil firm. Ukraine’s besieged government has embraced the idea of a crowdsourced I.T. army.But these attacks and the decentralized volunteerism are simply a distraction. In fact, often the most damaging cyberoperations are covert and deniable by design. In the heat of war, it’s harder to keep track of who is conducting what attack on whom, especially when it is advantageous to both victim and perpetrator to keep the details concealed.The day the Russian invasion started, ViaSat, a provider of high-speed satellite broadband services, suffered an outage. The services of Ka-Sat, one of its satellites, were seriously affected. The satellite covers 55 countries, predominantly in Europe, and provides fast internet connectivity. Among the affected Ka-Sat users: the Ukrainian armed forces, the Ukrainian police and Ukraine’s intelligence service.ViaSat later revealed that the incident started in Ukraine and then spread, affecting 5,800 wind turbines in Germany and tens of thousands of modems across Europe as well. But details on the origin of this attack remain elusive, as does attribution. The Ukrainian security establishment, of course, has no interest in revealing the details of what might be a successful command-and-control attack in the middle of an existential war. Victor Zhora, a senior Ukrainian cybersecurity official, only generally acknowledged that the ViaSat incident caused “a really huge loss in communications” at the beginning of the war.A week into the war, the Ukrainian newspaper Pravda published the names, registration numbers and unit affiliations of 120,000 Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine. Such large leaks can have powerful psychological effects on the exposed entity, which feels vulnerable and exposed.Once again, though, the origin of the leak remains unclear. The material could have been procured from a Russian whistle-blower or taken through a network breach. Leaked files — in contrast to hacked machines — rarely contain clues for attribution. Some of the most consequential computer network breaches may stay covert for years, even decades. Cyberwar is here, but we don’t always know who is launching the shots.Second, cyberoperations in wartime are not as useful as bombs and missiles when it comes to inflicting the maximum amount of physical and psychological damage on the enemy. An explosive charge is more likely to create long-term harm than malicious software.A similar logic applies to the coverage of hostilities and the psychological toll that media reporting can have on the public. There’s no bigger story than the violent effects of war: victims of missile attacks, families sheltering underground, residential buildings and bridges reduced to piles of smoking rubble. In comparison, the sensationalist appeal of cyberattacks is significantly lower. Largely invisible, they will struggle to break into the news cycle, their immediate effect greatly diminished.We saw these dynamics play out in the Russian destructive malware “wiper” attacks of Feb. 23 and 24. Just hours before the invasion started, two cyberattacks hit Ukrainian targets: HermeticWizard, which affected several organizations, and IsaacWiper, which breached a Ukrainian government network. A third destructive malware attack was discovered on March 14, CaddyWiper, again targeting only some systems in a few unidentified Ukrainian organizations. It is unclear if these wiping attacks had any meaningful tactical effect against the victims, and the incidents never broke into the news cycle, especially when compared to the physical invasion of Ukraine by tanks and artillery.Finally, without deeper integration within a broader military campaign, the tactical effects of cyberattacks remain rather limited. Thus far, we have no information on Russian computer network operators integrating and combining their efforts in direct support of traditional operations. Russia’s muted showing in the digital arena most likely reflects its subpar planning and performance on the ground and in the air. Close observers have been baffled by the Russian Army’s insufficient preparation and training, its lack of effective combined arms operations, its poor logistics and maintenance and its failure to properly encrypt communications.Cyberwar has been playing a trick on us for decades — and especially in the past weeks. It keeps arriving for the first time, again and again, and simultaneously slipping away into the future. We’ve been stuck in a loop, doomed to repeat the same hackneyed debate, chasing sci-fi ghosts.To harden our defenses, we must first recognize cyberoperations for what they have been, are and will be: an integral part of 21st-century statecraft. The United States has a unique competitive advantage through its vibrant tech and cybersecurity industry. No other country comes even close to matching the U.S. public-private partnership in attributing and countering adversarial intelligence operations. These collaborative efforts must continue.The contours of digital conflict are slowly emerging from the shadows, as digitally upgraded intelligence operations at the edge of war: espionage, sabotage, covert action and counterintelligence, full of deception and disinformation.Thomas Rid (@RidT) is a professor of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies and the author of “Cyber War Will Not Take Place.”The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Anyone can read what you share.Give this articleRead in appBy Melena RyzikMarch 22, 2022As she was preparing to release “Crash,” the glossiest album of her career as a solo pop artist, Charli XCX was in the doldrums. In December, the British singer and songwriter landed a high-stakes “Saturday Night Live” performance that would feature two of her friends and collaborators, Caroline Polachek and Christine and the Queens.After a labyrinth of planning, rehearsal and boomerang travel, the whole thing was scrapped hours before air because of the Omicron surge. Navigating this disruption and other big questions about what might come next, Charli XCX spun out. “I actually felt really, really low in January,” she said, “and really sad, and was crying a lot and questioning a lot of things.”Eventually, the fog lifted; her public bravado kicked in. “My album is so good,” she tweeted last week. “It’s just true, I can’t help it.” “Crash,” which arrived on Friday, is the fifth and final LP released under the major label contract that Charli XCX, 29, signed as a 16-year-old. After she broke through in 2014 with the single “Boom Clap,” and earned a reputation as a hooky, hit-making writer for other artists, she grew more experimental, veering into hyperpop with Sophie and A.G. Cook, like her 2017 mixtape “Pop 2.” But she never lost her taste for collaborating.“She’s the queen of features,” said Polachek, a longtime friend. She and Christine and the Queens, the French artist Hélöise Letissier, who goes by Chris, are, indeed, featured on “New Shapes,” a synthy single from “Crash,” in which each wrote a verse about relationships — a subject they have long discussed in DMs and on podcasts. “I think we all fall in love quite differently,” Charli said.The relationship songs on “Crash” could double as a narrative about Charli XCX’s up-and-down time in the music industry, she added. She wanted the album to be her last, most packaged push for pop stardom — just to see if she could do it. “For me, there’s always been this eternal question of, like, could I be the biggest artist in the world,” she said, “or am I not made for it? Am I too weird, too left, too opinionated, too unlikable, too different looking, whatever, whatever, whatever?”Charli XCX got a rescheduled shot on “S.N.L.” this month, albeit without her pals. Now she’s wondering what the next phase of her career could be. “Who will I become? What will I look like? What will I wear? What will it sound like?” she said.Transformation and evolution were recurring topics when Charli XCX, Polachek and Chris got together in December, to discuss recording and performing together across continents. They each approach music from different lanes, as Polachek, formerly of the Brooklyn indie band Chairlift, put it: Charli on the social media-fueled pop front (she started on Myspace); Chris, who has lately been holed up in Los Angeles at work on a new Christine and the Queens album, arriving with a headier theatrical and performance background. “I love making music on my own, but I really find I come alive more when I share a space with them,” Charli said.In joint interviews and separately, they spoke about their careers and friendships, and why they work well as collaborators. “We’re feelers, you know,” Polachek said. These are edited excerpts from the conversations.Image“I roll my eyes when people point to female pop vocalists as an example of change in music,” Polachek said.Credit...Jingyu Lin for The New York TimesHow They MetPOLACHEK Charli and I met 12 years ago in Australia. I was playing double-decker synths, singing from behind the band — I wasn’t even really the lead singer of that band. And Charli was wearing platform sneakers that were like a foot high, with rainbow stripes, and she was just singing over an iPod and stomping onstage. The paradigms were so different. She was like, Caroline, I want you to produce music for me. At the time I’d never produced music for anyone, let alone myself.CHARLI XCX I remember watching Chairlift perform and Caroline’s vocals being incredible, and I think I was just really in awe of her. And I still am. I felt intimidated by her coolness, not that she was an intimidating person. She was really kind. I was maybe 18, and still traveling back and forth on trips from my parents’ house.POLACHEK I did a mega-story Instagram post when Chris put out the “Girlfriend” video, I was just blown away by it, and I think you responded to that story and said, “I’m a fan” and I was like, “I’m a fan.” We had a pen pal relationship for about a year and a half, and quite a deep one, before we actually met. Just on Instagram DM. We were talking about love and pain.CHRIS I can go deep with you in conversation, and I appreciate that in our friendship.Image“The truth is, I’m allowed to be whoever I want, because the reason I’m an interesting artist is because I evolve and change,” Charli XCX said.Credit...Jingyu Lin for The New York TimesOn Gender in the Music IndustryCHARLI XCX Now, and for the past however many years, I’ve loved co-writing. I see it as a real skill to be able to hone multiple people’s ideas into one sensical thing. But what I did experience [from outsiders] was a sense of disbelief that I could possibly write a song. Maybe that’s a lack of education in the minutiae of the music industry and the different roles — the songwriter; the producer; the artist who sometimes doubles as both. I think there’s still a narrative of people being like, oh, did Olivia Rodrigo really write that song? Or did Taylor Swift?Like, it seems that there needs to be this question around women’s validity and whether they’re worth their space, whereas it just doesn’t really seem to be a question for men.POLACHEK I roll my eyes when people point to female pop vocalists as an example of change in music. No. Women’s faces and women’s voices have been prominent since the beginning of pop music. It’s who has their hand on the dial. That’s what’s changing.CHARLI XCX There are more ways to be an artist because there are more platforms — there’s TikTok, there’s SoundCloud. There’s being that girl in your bedroom, releasing songs and organically building a fan base via your own memes. Those things are all true, but unfortunately, and maybe call me a pessimist, I do feel like there are still boxes that women are supposed to fit in.And there are definitely moments that break that mold — Billie Eilish becoming the biggest artist in the world. A great artist creates an amazing world for people to access. I feel like people sometimes are not willing to accept that women artists evolve. Billie did a performance using Auto-Tune, and the world imploded. And it’s like, that’s an artistic choice.I’m the weird girl on the fringes who made “Pop 2” and people loved me for that, and I’m eternally grateful for that support. That helped me sustain a career that, post-2014 to 2015, wasn’t very commercially successful. I found a new lease on life playing closer to the underground, more avant-garde sounds. Maybe this is just the Twitter discourse, which I probably need to get my head out of, but sometimes it feels like I’m being told, no, you’re not allowed to be anyone other than that. And really, the truth is, I’m allowed to be whoever I want, because the reason I’m an interesting artist is because I evolve and change.CHRIS I’m off social, stopped in July. My mental health is better. My connection to the present is better. I think social sometimes — when it’s hyper-filtered and it needs to be punchy, catchy, immediately digestible — it’s encouraging something that I’m not always understanding myself, as an artist. Sometimes I want to take more time to express an idea.My journey with gender has always been tumultuous. It’s raging right now, as I’m just exploring what is beyond this. A way to express it could be switching between they and she. I kind of want to tear down that system that made us label genders in such a strict way. I remember talking about being pansexual in France in 2014 — it was a conversation that few opened up, and I was advised in, like, offices to maybe tone it down. I’m really trying to address it the right way now, and I’ve been sometimes pressured to give an answer. But I think the answer is to be flickery, fluid, escaping.I don’t want to rush that conversation, and I might never answer again. But in my work I’m finding ways to make that journey joyful. I believe the real gestures are artistic, because the real discussion on queerness is also a discussion about the society we live in, about capitalism, about social justice. It’s not just about me every morning wondering, am I masculine or feminine? It’s all-encompassing.Image“My journey with gender has always been tumultuous,” Chris said. “It’s raging right now, as I’m just exploring what is beyond this.”Credit...Jingyu Lin for The New York TimesOn What They Value in Each Other as ArtistsPOLACHEK Chris has a sense of velocity and total commitment. Most people when they’re in rehearsal mode, they do things at 50 percent energy because you don’t want to wear yourself out, you’re just doing it for your brain. Chris is at like 100 percent, 150 percent, every single time, and just raises the level of commitment and energy flow for everyone around.CHRIS I’ve been a fan of Caroline forever. I like how artistic everything is, how intentional everything is. There is an elegance, it’s demanding, but also super melodic.CHARLI XCX I think Caroline sees the potential for pop music to be anything that she can mold. She can create and make it sound or look or do anything that she wants, because she has all the skill set to do that.With Caroline and Chris sometimes, honestly, I’m just envious of their music. When I heard “Girlfriend,” I was like, God, I want to work with [Christine’s collaborator] Dâm-Funk. And I did and I was like, I don’t have this magical connection with this person, even though he’s amazing. Like, I wish Chris was here to figure this out for me.CHRIS Charli, I relate very deeply to you writing the song. I can tell that you’re making music with what you experienced and the feeling you go through. There is something very earnest about your writing.CHARLI XCX Well, you were sort of my therapist for a while. You give good advice.Especially over the past couple of years, I’ve been able to turn to both of them for a lot of personal things outside of music, and also, personal things that connect to music. Sometimes I think it’s hard, being an artist, to vocalize that you’re having a hard time, because obviously, we’re so lucky to be able sustain ourselves from the things that we create. But also, everyone has struggles. It’s nice to speak with others who are in the same kind of situation as you, to confide in them about things that they get. I’m really, really grateful for that.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySite Information Navigation© 2022 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsAccessibilityWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapCanadaInternationalHelpSubscriptions",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/22/arts/music/charli-xcx-christine-queens-caroline-polachek.html?action=click&module=Well&pgtype=Homepage&section=Music,,3/22/2022

ZelizerMarch 22, 2022FLIPPEDHow Georgia Turned Purple and Broke the Monopoly on Republican PowerBy Greg BluesteinHow do Democrats flip a state from red to purple to blue? This question keeps Democratic operatives lying awake at night.What better place to search for answers than Georgia? In 2020, Georgians voted for the Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden. The elections of the Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff  also handed Democrats a slim majority in the U.S. Senate. The results, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter Greg Bluestein in his new book, “Flipped,” provided “Democrats an invaluable foothold in the Deep South and a bulwark against growing Republican strength in the Midwest.”Demography was not destiny, according to Bluestein. Despite the developments that were enlarging liberal, educated suburban communities while diversifying the Georgia population, partisan change depended on talented candidates, campaign strategists and local election officials.Bluestein revisits the story of Stacey Abrams, who, working with the guidance of Lauren Groh-Wargo, ran a trailblazing campaign for the governorship in 2018. Abrams was one of the first statewide figures who sought to harness the “emerging alliance that was racially, economically and geographically diverse” rather than trying to recreate the Democratic coalition that elected Bill Clinton to the presidency in 1992. Bluestein recounts how Abrams, a Black woman, was almost denied the right to vote because a poll worker insisted that she had requested an absentee ballot. If Abrams, an attorney, struggled to cast a ballot, “what about the countless other Georgians, she wondered, who could never have so quickly fixed their problem?” After losing the contest to Secretary of State Brian Kemp, Abrams founded Fair Fight, which would register large numbers of Black voters by the 2020 election.A bright spot for Democrats in 2018 was Lucy McBath, the daughter of civil rights activists. She defeated Karen Handel to represent the Sixth Congressional District. Handel had won office a year earlier in a special election, beating Ossoff, a documentary producer who had hoped to show that with Donald Trump in the White House, Democrats could win suburban Republicans and independents in districts that had been dominated by conservatives like Newt Gingrich. Instead, the election proved that Republican voters in 2017 were still loyal. McBath, whose son, Jordan, was killed by a white man in 2012, won election by advocating gun control in the wake of a horrendous mass school shooting in Florida.Ossoff and Warnock found ways to run effective statewide campaigns for the Senate in 2020 despite the challenges posed by Covid shutdowns, masking and social distancing. During the runoff election campaign after Nov. 3, both candidates responded to the fierce outrage among Democrats who were tired of the chaos and extremism coming from the White House. As Trump kept talking about himself and about rigged votes every time he visited the state (to the frustration of Republicans), Warnock and Ossoff ran smart social media campaigns and connected to voters’ hope for a better future.Remarkably, Bluestein writes that the Biden campaign underestimated the potential for victory in Georgia. Since Democrats had not won the state’s electoral votes in a presidential election since 1992, Biden’s team concluded that the risk of losing was too high. Fortunately for Democrats, local candidates disagreed. They did so by embracing the party’s liberal traditions rather than trying to mimic Republicans.Still, the victories in 2020 ultimately depended on volunteers and voters whose voices are too often missing from Bluestein’s narrative. He doesn’t do enough to capture the thousands of volunteers who engaged in phone banking, text messaging, canvassing and turning out the vote. Nor are there many portraits of the voters who went blue.“Flipped” will disillusion Democrats who hope that a realignment won’t meet fierce resistance. Lawrence Sloan, a Black American who operated a machine that opened mail-in ballots in Fulton County, was scared for his life after a video circulated online that appeared to show Sloan giving the middle finger to the machine and tossing out a ballot. In fact, we learn, his temper flared because the machine had nicked his finger, and Sloan was throwing out instructions for how to complete a mail-in ballot. Because of the misleading video, which Trump’s sons retweeted, Sloan was harassed and threatened. On one occasion, he asked friends to rescue him from a restaurant filled with Trump loyalists. “As a Black man in the South,” he said, “I know when pickup trucks start pulling up and honking their horns, it’s time to go.” Similarly, the Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, who refused to go along with Trump’s schemes, decided that his two grandchildren could not safely visit his home.All of this brings us to the question of whether Georgia has really flipped or if 2020 was an aberration. Many parts of Bluestein’s story highlight how exceptional the conditions were in 2020. Democrats won with the help of Hollywood celebrities and political heavyweights who won’t always show up. A raging pandemic as well as a president whose politics terrified many voters raised the stakes of the state’s election in ways that would otherwise have been impossible.The next few elections will reveal if Democratic success has staying power. It is worth remembering that Jimmy Carter’s efforts to forge a new kind of Democratic South ended up being trumped by Gingrich’s version of Reagan Republicanism. Even after reading this informative book, it’s all too easy to imagine how a struggling President Biden, an inflationary economy, war in Ukraine and a persistent pandemic — combined with gerrymandering, high rural turnout, national party support and Election Day polling sabotage — could result in Republicans welcoming back the Grand Old Party in 2024 following a short detour off the beaten path of conservatism.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySite Information Navigation© 2022 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsAccessibilityWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapCanadaInternationalHelpSubscriptions",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/22/books/review/greg-bluestein-flipped-georgia.html?action=click&module=Well&pgtype=Homepage&section=Book%20Review,,3/22/2022

Anyone can read what you share.Give this article174Read in appBy Kim SeversonMarch 22, 2022ATLANTA — Emily Nunn won’t drive on the freeways here, so it can take 45 minutes to get from her apartment to the cavernous indoor Your Dekalb Farmers Market, whose inexpensive and bountiful produce selection she prefers.We hadn’t even reached the lettuce bins before she started in.“Everybody in the food business hates me,” she said, taking a moment to defend both her vigorous use of mint and her penchant for social-media agitation, particularly when it comes to ageism. “It’s because I have so much fun. And I don’t care anymore.”The word “everybody” is hyperbole, of course. After years as a food writer at high-profile publications like The New Yorker, Ms. Nunn now swims in a much smaller part of the food-media sea: She writes a twice-weekly newsletter about salad.Ms. Nunn, 61, is as surprised as anyone that The Department of Salad is holding steady as the sixth-most-popular paid food newsletter on Substack, which is home to hundreds of newsletters about food and cooking. Hers was a career Hail Mary pass during the first year of the pandemic, when she was eating a lot of salad. She would post photos of them on her Twitter feed with a comment like “Here is another damn salad.”She sometimes mentioned her tiny hometown, Galax, Va., and her Aunt Mariah’s antics, suggested that Republicans perform specific sex acts, or crowdsourced tuna salad recipes.She also tweeted about how life looked from the vantage point of an older single woman: “I once went to a dinner party with all couples and one of the wives asked me: But what do you do at night? I told her I freebased.”ImageMs. Nunn auditioning the cast for her newsletter at the sprawling Your Dekalb Farmers Market in Decatur, Ga.Credit...Melissa Golden for The New York TimesThe Department of Salad could just as easily have been The Department of Dips, she said, because she was eating a lot of them, too.“Look, I’m not the world’s biggest salad fan,” she said as we arrived back at Department of Salad headquarters — a small, tasteful shotgun apartment with a balcony and a counter full of vinegars in a slightly fancy suburban building.“I love salad and I’ve gotten better at salad, but it’s this kind of food writing that I’ve missed,” she said. “I don’t want to be going to the parties in Brooklyn and writing about amping up the flavor of everything. I love it, but I can’t do that. I had to make something of my own.”The excitement of reinventing yourself can be extraordinary, and the wide world of food provides plenty of opportunity. (See: James Beard, Julia Child, Anthony Bourdain, Carla Hall, etc.)After a long writing career that included co-creating The New Yorker’s Tables for Two column, reporting for the Chicago Tribune, blogging, contributing to the website Food52 and publishing a book, Ms. Nunn found herself living a quiet country life in a leaky converted horse barn in North Carolina that she found on Craigslist. It was a good place, she said, to recover from a rare but treatable form of blood cancer that struck in 2018.Then the pandemic hit. The money from her well-reviewed 2017 memoir “The Comfort Food Diaries,” which chronicled life after a drinking career and the suicide of her closeted gay brother, was almost gone. She couldn’t get hired by a mainstream publication. She was down to rolling quarters.One of the true glories of a Southern summer is that month or so when the tomatoes pile up next to the cucumbers on the kitchen counter, and the peaches and berries are sweet with juice. Tossing them into salad kept Ms. Nunn sane. Her Twitter account, a funny, cranky and political corner of the social-media universe with a modest 18,300 followers, kept her connected.ImageMs. Nunn’s method for cleaning lettuce and other greens starts with a few gentle baths in bowls filled with water.Credit...Melissa Golden for The New York TimesImageMs. Nunn thinks unripe avocados are underused in salads, which benefit from their slightly nutty taste and firm texture.Credit...Melissa Golden for The New York TimesA food writer suggested on Twitter that she start a salad newsletter. The actor J. Smith-Cameron, who plays Gerri Kellman on “Succession,” tweeted that she would read something like that. By October 2020, Ms. Nunn had one going.The following February, she started charging $50 a year, or $5.50 a month. She made $20,000 right out of the gate. Her followers include the British food writer Diana Henry, media personalities like Soledad O’Brien, pediatric surgeons, Vanity Fair writers, people from Cleveland and doulas.Ms. Nunn wouldn’t disclose how many of her more than 17,000 subscribers pay, or what she earns now. But she did say she is making more than she did when she was laid off from her job as a roaming feature writer for the Chicago Tribune in 2009.Her witty newsletters are a bridge mix of information. She might feature an interview with someone with a point of view about salad, or use a recipe from a vintage cookbook or an old menu as a writing prompt. The recipes, like orange and radish salad or herby rice salad with peas and prosciutto, only sometimes include lettuce.“Salad is a lot of fun because it’s not like lasagna,” Ms. Nunn said. “If I was doing a lasagna newsletter it would be like, ‘This time put Italian sausage in it, or make a béchamel.’ But there are a million different kinds of salads.”ImageMs. Nunn hard at work in the Department of Salad laboratory — her home kitchen.Credit...Melissa Golden for The New York TimesShe interviewed Bill Smith, the celebrated North Carolina chef, on whether the South has a signature salad. “We’re both resigned to the fact that most non-Southerners are always going to try to pin molded gelatin salads on us,” she said.He gave her his recipes for garlicky carrot slaw and celery root rémoulade.For her first newsletter, she had a long chat with Mollie Katzen, who wrote “The Moosewood Cookbook,” and they went deep into the preparation of lettuce.Lettuce care is a particular skill of Ms. Nunn’s. “What’s worse than sand in salad?” she asked. She swishes each variety a few times, separately, in a big stainless steel bowl, then dries them in a spinner she found at a yard sale. She is also good at reviving lettuce and arugula, by wrapping it in slightly damp paper towels and tucking it inside a zip-top bag.Other tricks include shaving unripe avocado on a mandoline, using the slices to add a nutty texture to a salad without the sometimes overpowering butteriness of ripe ones.Ms. Nunn is an advocate of putting lots of citrus and soft herbs in salads, and calling on red onion to save the day. “I have this theory that whenever there’s anything wrong with anything, add a tablespoon of very finely chopped raw red onion and everything will be fine.”Yukari Sakamoto, the author of “Food Sake Tokyo,” is building a collection of favorite Department of Salad recipes, including spicy cherry salad from Mitchell Davis, a former executive of the James Beard Foundation, and one of Ms. Nunn’s latest, a vintage green olive dressing made with a hard-boiled egg yolk and basil.Ms. Sakamoto trusts Ms. Nunn’s palate, and is a fan of her voice. “It’s a bit sassy, which sometimes has me laughing out loud on a busy Tokyo train.”ImageAlthough some of Ms. Nunn’s favorite salads are simple mixes of soft herbs, lettuce and citrus, the Department of Salad has plenty of recipes without any leafy greens.Credit...Melissa Golden for The New York TimesThe editor of The New Yorker, David Remnick, who was brought up to regard salad as a close relative of castor oil, says he has been a fan of Ms. Nunn’s humor since they both joined the magazine in 1992.“Getting something that’s authentically funny and not the latest gag of the day, but something that has an innately funny voice and real wit — that’s really rare,” he said. “To see her now bringing the funny as a food writer, I wish I had thought of it long ago.”He, like others who have worked with her, says Ms. Nunn has never been one to hold back. That helps explain her relentless Twitter campaign against ageism in hiring, which often targets The Washington Post and its owner, Jeff Bezos, whom she has also blamed for a lack of frisée at his Whole Foods Markets.Her crusade started when she applied for a job at the paper in 2018. An editor mistakenly sent an impersonal rejection letter explaining that the job required someone with more experience and a significant number of years at a well-known publication. It ended with a cheery “Keep writing! Good luck with your career.”Ms. Nunn was incensed, and posted that sentiment on Twitter, along with her age. “I mean, if it wasn’t ageism, why was I on auto-reject?” she said. “I had three times the experience they needed.”The tweet quickly turned into a discussion about age discrimination, and went viral. Others of her generation shared tales of never even getting a call back for an interview, even though they were more than qualified for jobs. A cause was born.“It’s just soul-annihilating,” she said of ageism. “I’m not anti-younger people. I’m pro-older people in the mix.”The editor who had sent the letter followed with an apology, which Ms. Nunn also posted. Her later applications for jobs at the Post, including one in the Food section, never resulted in an interview. She has targeted the paper ever since, contacting various editors to no avail and even filing a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which she knew wouldn’t really go anywhere.This month, when the Post published a collection of crossword puzzles to honor Women’s History Month, she tweeted: “Thanks for the fun crosswords. Older women can do them while standing in line for food stamps.”Joe Yonan, the paper’s Food editor, who has taken much of her heat, declined to comment. Some of Ms. Nunn’s friends are suggesting that what once seemed a worthy fight against ageism in the media is dangerously close to taking a right turn into the land of unhealthy obsession.ImageA mustardy vinagrette is a Department of Salad favorite. Credit...Melissa Golden for The New York Times“It’s frustrating to be super-talented and have all that experience and you can’t get arrested, but her vendettas sometimes are a little hard,” said Steve Sando, whose coveted Rancho Gordo Beans mail-order club has a waiting list of 40,000 people. (He once hired Ms. Nunn to write about beans. “We asked for four or five recipes. Amazingly, she gave us ‘War and Peace’ on beans.”)He understands her anger. Ms. Nunn, he said, is among a new school of food writers who have found success by being uncompromising and sharply political on social media.Dan Stone, a writer and bar owner who works on writer partnerships for Substack, has been a fan since Ms. Nunn’s time at The New Yorker. When he saw her thread about ageism in March 2021, he reached out to see how he could support her work on the platform. It led to a yearlong contract for a minimum financial guarantee, which ends this month. Ms. Nunn and Substack are discussing the next year.On Substack, Ms. Nunn is competing with some big names like Alison Roman, a former New York Times columnist whose newsletter (simply called “a newsletter”) holds the top spot on the platform’s paid food list, and the pastry chef David Lebovitz, who has been writing a letter from France since 2005.Other heavy hitters, like Ruth Reichl and Andrew Zimmern, have recently started Substack newsletters, looking to find a successful mix of video, recipes, reader participation and storytelling at a moment when consumer subscription burnout may not be far off.Ms. Nunn’s own burnout may not be all that far off, either. Despite her running joke about getting help from “the boys in the lab,” she does everything herself, with only a light read from a copy editor paid for by Substack.“I’m exhausted all the time,” she said. “I always have salad dressing in my hair.”But she’s happy. “I like making a living just being myself.”Recipes: Herby Rice Salad With Peas and Prosciutto | Orange and Radish SaladFollow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.

Several studies have found that while mRNA booster shots have been successful at preventing hospitalization and death, their effectiveness against infections is waning.It’s no wonder, then, that late Thursday, Moderna sought emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration for a second booster shot for all adults. The company’s request came just days after Pfizer and BioNTech filed for emergency authorization for a second booster of its coronavirus vaccine for people 65 and older.Moderna said that its much broader request would give the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as health care providers, more flexibility in determining who would benefit most from getting an additional booster shot and when.Scientists and physicians are sharply divided over this. “I don’t think everybody should get another booster right now,” said Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, a pediatric infectious diseases physician at Stanford University. “But I don’t see any reason why we shouldn’t start to review the data that is available.”Who is currently eligible for a fourth vaccine dose?As of now, the only people authorized for a fourth dose are those with weakened immune systems. This includes teenagers and adults who have had organ or stem cell transplants, are undergoing chemotherapy for cancer, have advanced or untreated H.I.V. or are on immune-suppressing drugs.It’s hard to predict how soon — or if — the F.D.A. might authorize a second booster (or fourth dose) for all adults. The agency is expected to convene an advisory committee next month to discuss the issue. And while experts say it’s reasonable that the committee might move swiftly on Pfizer’s application for older adults, it is unclear if Moderna’s more sweeping request will get the green light.“We know that people over the age of 65, even when vaccinated, have a higher risk of dying than people under the age of 65,” said Dr. Carlos del Rio, an infectious disease specialist at Emory University. “That gets lowered significantly if people get boosted.”One reason older adults may benefit from an additional booster shot is because as the immune system ages, it tends to weaken and does not produce the same quantity or quality of antibodies as it did when it was younger. On top of that, older adults often have other medical conditions that take up the body’s attention, putting them at higher risk of severe disease, said Dr. Christian Gaebler, an immunology researcher at Rockefeller University in New York City. “Diabetes, hypertension, obesity and chronic kidney disease are all risk factors for severe Covid,” he said. “And we know that these usually manifest in older age.”In their justification for seeking second boosters for people 65 and up, Pfizer and BioNTech relied heavily on evidence from two studies conducted in Israel that suggested that people who had received fourth shots were less likely to become infected with the virus compared with those who had received three doses.The Coronavirus Pandemic: Latest UpdatesUpdated March 29, 2022, 1:09 p.m. ETShould you get another Covid booster?The F.D.A. authorizes second Covid booster shots for those 50 and older, and some immunocompromised people.Here’s how Shanghai’s lockdown is testing China’s ‘Covid-zero’ policy, and people’s limits.In one study, published on a preprint server in February, scientists reviewed the health records of about 1.1 million people over 60 who had received a fourth dose and compared them with those who had received just three doses. They found that the rate of confirmed infections, as well as that of severe illness, was lower in people who had gotten their fourth shot.The second study, published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, looked at Israeli health care workers of all ages and found that both Pfizer’s and Moderna’s fourth shots bolstered antibody levels, though they were not very good at preventing infection.Experts, however, cautioned that the available data is still preliminary and has not yet shown how long the benefits of a fourth dose will last.If the shots are authorized for seniors, how should they think about timing them?Experts tracking Covid-19 are careful not to give specific advice on when to get a fourth dose when the safety and efficacy data are still limited.If another surge is just around the corner, for instance, seniors may benefit from getting an extra shot as soon as it’s authorized. But if the next wave doesn’t occur until the summer or even the fall, getting a booster now could backfire because the recipients’ immunity might start to wane by the time they need protection the most. Current vaccines are based on the original strain of the coronavirus, so getting a booster now may also do little to protect against future variants.“It would be great if we knew exactly when the next wave was going to be so we could vaccinate people beforehand,” said Dr. Amy Sherman, an infectious disease physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. “But I think we’re not quite at the point where we know a clear seasonality, and we know the exact tempo and dynamics of Covid and newer variants.”That being said, if a fourth shot is authorized for adults over 65, and it has already been several months since they got their first booster, “I would start thinking about whether I need a booster now,” Dr. del Rio said.What does this mean for everyone else?For people younger than 65, who are otherwise healthy, most experts agree that three doses are most likely enough for now. Those in their 20s and 30s who have already received three shots of the vaccine, for instance, will only see marginal benefits in protection from an additional shot, Dr. Gaebler said.“Fourth doses might turn out to be advisable,” he said, “but at this point I think the focus should be on administering third doses.”Dr. del Rio agreed. “I’m more concerned about the millions of Americans who are not vaccinated or are only partially vaccinated,” he said. “That, to me, is where we need to put our major focus.” Getting more people vaccinated, nationally and globally, could potentially have a bigger effect on reducing virus transmission and curtailing new variants so that everyone can return to normal life, Dr. del Rio said.And there is hope that better vaccines and treatments are on the way. Pfizer and Moderna are testing new Omicron-specific versions of the Covid booster. And other researchers are investigating vaccines that boost mucosal immunity in the nose, as well as protein-based shots that may be better at protecting against the coronavirus in the future.“We have to really think carefully about our vaccine strategies,” Dr. Sherman said. “We have to think as a society about what our goal is with repeated boosters and vaccines because none of our existing vaccines completely prevent transmission or prevent all disease. And so at what point are we comfortable with asymptomatic or mild infection in the population while still being able to protect those who are vulnerable?”Audio produced by Kate Winslett.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySite Information Navigation© 2022 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsAccessibilityWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapCanadaInternationalHelpSubscriptions",https://www.nytimes.com/article/4th-covid-shot-2nd-booster.html?action=click&module=Well&pgtype=Homepage&section=Well,,3/23/2022

Anyone can read what you share.Give this articleRead in appCredit...Chris Simpson for The New York Times. Food stylist: Maggie Ruggiero. Prop stylist: Sophia Pappas.By Ligaya MishanMarch 23, 2022There is never one lentil but always a crowd. They start out as pebbles in the hand, hard and tiny — in certain parts of the world, they are the size against which all small things are measured. Then, in the pot, their little stony hearts melt. They soften, loosen up and let other flavors in. They’re still discrete, still individuals, but now joined in common cause, and they swell and grow plump, so you end up with more than twice as much, velvety and lush. They feed many.In the West we tend to think of lentils as merely virtuous, something good for us. So eating them feels like a duty, and our desire for them wilts. Other cultures are wiser. They know this humble, inexpensive ingredient is a path to luxury. Out of a handful of seeds, abundance; out of austerity, splendor. The lentil stew rqaq w adas is extravagant on the table, but has its origins in thrift. As the Palestinian artist and chef Mirna Bamieh explains, it was traditionally a way to use scraps of dough left over from baking bread. (In Arabic, adas are lentils, rqaq is a flatbread as thin and nearly as sheer as paper and w — here pronounced “wa” — is the conjunction that unites them.) First the lentils are set to simmer with a dusting of cumin, bringing its stealthy warmth. Then the onions go in, bronzed from a pan, along with tamarind, to make the mouth pucker, and sweet-sour pomegranate molasses — which is molasses only in spirit, slow-moving and thick, the fruit’s ruby seeds crushed and strained and the juice cooked down to a near lacquer.This could be enough on its own, but here comes the dough. The scraps not destined for bread are rolled out, then up into cylinders and slashed into long skinny strands that look like tagliatelle. If there are no scraps, no matter: The dish is so good, so earthy and flagrantly delicious, that people don’t wait for the excuse of baking day to make it. Instead, they knead together a quick dough or swap in dried pasta. (It’s just as great.) The noodles are dropped right in the pot, to cook among the lentils, leaching starch into the water and making it even richer.Out of a handful of seeds, abundance; out of austerity, splendor. The work in the kitchen is invisible, but there is pageantry on the plate: bright pops of pomegranate seeds, fresh parsley, little pan-fried squares of flatbread and crispy onions all entwined. These are strewn over the top, not willy-nilly if you want to do it right, but in bold stripes. (You may forgo the onions or the flatbread to save time — what you can’t do without are the pomegranate and parsley, for a sweet crunch and sunny finish.)Rqaq w adas is known by different names. Sometimes the ingredients are reversed and yoked by a preposition. In some areas, it is called rishta or, poetically, harak osbao, or he-burned-​his-finger — presumably commemorating a diner who was too eager to dig in. Bamieh, who was born in Jerusalem, didn’t grow up eating it at home. She found it later in life, when she began to research the cuisine of her heritage in 2017. She wondered why the Palestinian restaurants in Ramallah at the time all served the same limited number of dishes. Recipes are both living history and cultural archive, and she worried about what was being lost in the fragmentation of life under occupation. “Dishes are leaving our tables,” she says. “Stories are leaving us.”She traveled through the West Bank and Israel, studying local culinary traditions. In one village, she touched the grooves of an ancient hand-carved wooden mold used for generations to bake milk bread for Easter. Then she went deeper, going family to family, documenting their cooking practices and repeated displacements. Later that year, she founded the Palestine Hosting Society and started staging dinner-performances to tell the stories behind the food — of foraging for snails in the hills of the Upper Galilee and fishing off the coast of Gaza (before the Israeli government set restrictions); of grandmothers shaping qizha, an inky tahini of pulverized nigella seeds that is a specialty of the ancient city of Nablus, into dark orbs laced with orange-blossom water, each hoarding a whole pistachio inside.“I’m presented sometimes as a food activist,” Bamieh says. “I’m just doing what I like.” She thinks of these dinners — with the food laid out slowly, course after course, and everything shared — as “a way for people to talk to each other. To be curious.”Recipe: rqaq w adas (lentils with pasta)AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySite Information Navigation© 2022 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsAccessibilityWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapCanadaInternationalHelpSubscriptions",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/23/magazine/lentil-stew.html?action=click&module=Well&pgtype=Homepage&section=The%20New%20York%20Times%20Magazine,,3/23/2022

The subjects were teenage girls between 13 and 16 who had started having “abrupt-onset tic-like movements.” The tics were puzzling because Tourette’s syndrome and other tic disorders — characterized by involuntary and repeated movements or sounds — are far more common among boys and tend to first appear in early childhood with small movements; the girls’ movements, though, were large, accompanied by vocalizations and had other unique traits. Among them: The girls all described having watched TikTok videos of tics before their symptoms began, suggesting the potential spread of a social contagion.Indeed, the C.D.C. last month reported a pronounced increase in similar tics based on evidence from a source never before used to assess specific mental-health conditions among the nation’s children: emergency-room data. For girls ages 12 to 17, the proportion of visits to the E.R. for tics nearly tripled during the pandemic as of January 2022. Visits also doubled for eating disorders, and there were increases related to anxiety, trauma and stress and obsessive-compulsive disorders.These findings, particularly the rise in what have been called TikTok tics, have received considerable media coverage. But “equally striking,” says the lead author, Lakshmi Radhakrishnan, a health scientist at the C.D.C., is the marked but less widely discussed decrease in mental-​health visits by adolescent boys.Why do girls appear to be struggling? Are boys faring better? Or are their problems more likely to be overlooked? The numbers can’t answer questions like these. “No single, comprehensive surveillance system for children’s mental health in the United States exists,” the C.D.C. noted in a supplementary report. The current surveys that keep tabs on various aspects of mental health in children are too slow to capture swift changes amid a national crisis. And though rapid surveys have evaluated the pandemic’s impact on the mental health of adults, fewer have considered how children are doing. “A lot of times kids aren’t the first in line,” says Daniel Dickstein, the associate chief and director of research at McLean Hospital’s child and adolescent psychiatry division. And, he points out, if more children were getting adequate mental-health care earlier, fewer would end up in the E.R., a venue that is not set up for ongoing treatment of psychiatric conditions.ImageCredit...Illustration by Ori ToorEmergency-room data has been monitored for almost two decades by the C.D.C. as part of a response to 9/11 and a congressional mandate to track health measures in the event of disease outbreaks or other public-health emergencies. Though mental-health data from the E.R. has not been a specific focus for the C.D.C. over the years, it has now enabled the agency to produce a report that is meant, Radhakrishnan says, to raise awareness among parents, physicians and mental-health organizations.This is especially important for emerging conditions in order to reduce misdiagnoses. For the tics many adolescent girls are having, for example, “we would want to treat looking at anxiety and depression,” says John Piacentini, an expert in tic disorders and director of the Child Anxiety Resilience Education Support Center at the University of California, Los Angeles. Those conditions can increase the vulnerability of children to developing tics and eating disorders. Hence doctors should use great care in prescribing medications for tics because Tourette’s syndrome and other movement disorders — and kids can have more than one — often involve different neurological pathways.The Coronavirus Pandemic: Latest UpdatesUpdated March 29, 2022, 1:09 p.m. ETShould you get another Covid booster?The F.D.A. authorizes second Covid booster shots for those 50 and older, and some immunocompromised people.Here’s how Shanghai’s lockdown is testing China’s ‘Covid-zero’ policy, and people’s limits.“With the social isolation and lack of social connection, I think that hit girls harder than boys,” Piacentini says. “Girls tend to socialize in different ways.” If, as experts believe, the tics that many of them have experienced during the pandemic mirror behavior they saw online, it may be an unintentional way of trying to make connections during what for many has been a period of loneliness. “I think it’s a little beyond their control,” he says of the tics. “I don’t think most kids are doing this for attention.”It would be easy to blame the pandemic for changes in mental health that have been observed since March 2020. But in December, when the surgeon general noted a “mental-health crisis” among young people, he made clear that rising numbers of children and young adults were struggling with anxiety and depression before Covid-19. Between 2013 and 2019, A.D.H.D. and anxiety were the most common mental disorders among those 3 to 17 years old, with each condition affecting roughly one in 11 children, according to the C.D.C. More than one in five 12- to 17-year-olds experienced a major depressive episode. Yet in 2019, fewer than 15 percent of children between the ages of 5 and 17 received some kind of mental-​health treatment. “Pre-Covid we had a mental-health crisis,” says John T. Walkup, chairman of the psychiatry and behavioral-health department at Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago. “The biggest misconception is that Covid makes people mentally ill. From my point of view, Covid unmasked people who have underlying vulnerabilities.”Unfortunately, that means letting go of the popular notion that a return to “normal” for children — in-​person schooling, no more masks — will reverse those trends. In fact, such measures may compound the stress many students already feel, says Lisa Fortuna, the U.C.S.F. chief of psychiatry at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital. And an estimated 200,000 children in the U.S. who lost a parent or guardian to Covid-19 may need additional support. Screening for depression and anxiety at schools and pediatricians’ offices will be crucial, because the symptoms associated with those conditions are easier to manage and do less damage when addressed early. For adolescents, substance abuse, eating disorders and thoughts of suicide can be complications of both anxiety and depression.In preadolescent children, Fortuna says, depression may reveal itself as touchiness and irritability rather than sadness. For all ages, a withdrawal from routine activities is a warning sign, as is excessive worry. Symptoms vary greatly, but in general, depressed girls may become withdrawn, whereas boys may fight or act out, incurring the label of behavior problem rather than, say, mood disorder. “Clinically, I’m seeing a lot of young men presenting with depressive symptoms,” Fortuna says. That’s despite the decrease in male visits to the E.R. that the C.D.C. found. “They are still there,” she says. “They might not be as loudly presenting.”Opening a dialogue with children about how they are feeling and listening without judgment are critical. “I would encourage parents to talk to kids and ask them, ‘Are you feeling sad?’” says Anita Everett, director of the Center for Mental Health Services at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. “We encourage people to also ask about suicide,” she adds. Doing so won’t plant the idea. If there’s a problem, don’t ignore it and hope it will go away. “Some sort of path forward is important,” Everett says.That path may well be arduous. A recent survey in Annals of Family Medicine found that 85 percent of primary-care practices are having difficulty accessing evidence-based mental-health care for children. Nationally, Fortuna says, some children are waiting six months to a year for help. She suggests first seeking advice from a primary-care doctor or school counselor. The SAMHSA website includes a treatment locator, and churches and other community groups can be valuable resources. Everett urges caregivers to ensure that weapons, especially guns, and medications and other dangerous substances are well secured in any home where a child will be. And, she says, parents should look for support for themselves. Perhaps it’s helpful — as well as tragic — to know that finding others whose children are struggling, and who are struggling themselves, won’t be difficult.If you are having thoughts of suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (TALK).

Our kids are not OK. Child advocates say children need help now






We call our children resilient, but some of Canada's top children's hospitals say kids are in crisis. As Kendra Slugoski discovered, doctors warn we can no longer ignore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on young people and we need to act now.

As any parent can attest, one thing that’s helped push them through the hardships of the COVID-19 pandemic has been a promise, and sometimes a prayer: “Kids are resilient. They will be OK.”
The line has been fed to guardians and caregivers worldwide, by doctors, politicians and well-meaning sympathetic onlookers.But as the pandemic drags on, having just passed its two-year anniversary, is it really that simple? Is there a limit to a child’s resilience?

				‘Heartbreaking’: How long COVID is impacting children				

Before considering resilience, Sheri Madigan, a clinical psychologist and Director of the Determinants of Child Development Lab at the University of Calgary, says we need to first look at how the pandemic has affected the mental health of children and adolescents over the past two years.  Story continues below advertisement



 “When we look at how kids were doing pre-pandemic and how they’re doing during the pandemic, we (are) seeing higher rates of depression, anxiety and eating disorders,” Madigan told Global News, pointing to her recent work that examined how more than 80,000 youth worldwide were coping approximately a year-and-a-half into the pandemic.The study, titled Global Prevalence of Depressive and Anxiety Symptoms in Children and Adolescents During COVID-19: A Meta-analysis, found that the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms in children and adolescents has doubled when compared to pre-pandemic estimates.The difference between resilience and ‘bouncing back’“In disasters like the pandemic, although some people use the notion of ‘bouncing back’ as being equivalent to ‘resilience,’ we have moved away from that simplistic idea of resilience,” says Robin Cox, a professor in the Disaster and Emergency Management graduate programs at Royal Roads University.“In a disaster we talk about resilience as more the ability to anticipate what is going to happen and the ability to weather it and continue to function as more changes are happening.”

Madigan agrees.“People often talk about resilience like it’s this trait — either you’re resilient or you’re not resilient,” she shared. “But, actually, resilience is two pieces — you have an adversity or difficult circumstances, and then you have whether you can draw on supports and strategies to help.”  Story continues below advertisement



 A matter of contextDigging into what truly makes someone resilient requires a look at individual circumstances, says Cox.Not everyone has had to endure or survive the same circumstances in this pandemic, and various conditions can affect one’s resilience.

Access to health care, good food, sufficient income, adequate housing, and job stability will all help with one’s resilience, she says.Also important are breaks from stressful life situations, a proper amount of rest and relaxation, as well as access informal supports, like time with family and friends or access to fulfilling hobbies or activities.

 “People with greater resources generally tend to be better off,” she says.

Cox also says the longer the pandemic drags on and the more curve balls it throws in terms of new waves, variants and changing restrictions, “one’s capacity to recover and carry on can be diminished.”Lagging supportLooking at the recent figures, Madigan says there’s a lack in those supports and strategies, especially on a societal level.Part of the problem, she says, is that there might be an expectation that kids will “bounce back” and our society is taking a wait-and-see approach.“I think that people are counting on — as we move into a post-pandemic future — that we will see some of this distress amongst youth attenuate or that, maybe, it will go back to those pre-pandemic estimates.”

Madigan agrees that parents should also be mindful of their own well-being, too, instead of keeping all focus on their kids.“When parents aren’t doing well, that can have a spillover onto their kids,” she warns.Connection and communication are keyRight now, says Madigan, connection and communication as a family unit shouldn’t be underestimated or underappreciated, as it’s one of the ways kids feel safest and most supported.  Story continues below advertisement



 She also points to a silver lining of the pandemic: it opened up lines of communication in a lot of households, and kids who’ve been strongly connected to their families “are doing better in the pandemic, overall.”Parents can continue to support their kids’ resilience by continuing to talk to their children and mirror healthy coping mechanisms, say both scholars.Families in #Alberta are going to make different decisions about #masking in school on Monday.

Keep talking to kids,” advises Madigan.  Story continues below advertisement



 “I think those patterns of relationships have been established and we need to keep them up.”The power of routineAlso important, say Madigan and Cox, is keeping basic, simple routines for kids and allowing some leeway for activities and relationships that help their development, like friendships and extra-curricular activities.It’s also OK to not want to go back to “pre-pandemic normal,” they both said, and we shouldn’t put that pressure on ourselves or others, especially in times like these when we appear to be getting a break from the pandemic but it’s not truly over.A bright spot for kids right now is the ability to be in school full-time, say both, with a relaxation of cohorting and activity restrictions.""In the last eight months, we have seen our education system rapidly adapting to the changes forced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Society at large can learn from some of the solutions….""#covid19 #education #adaptation #climatechangeREAD: https://t.co/a2jI2GNXWu pic.twitter.com/5D8RLYtj9G— Robin Cox (@RobinCox01) November 12, 2020  Story continues below advertisement



 Schools, they both explain, provide kids with the benefit of routine, friendship, support systems outside the family, and a chance to be creative and learn new things — all important in building resilience.Too soon to tellIn many ways, it’s too soon to tell how kids — both on a widespread and individual level — will leave the pandemic in terms of overall well-being, says Madigan. But she assures parents that most children likely won’t hold onto intense anxieties surrounding masking or public health measures as time passes.She also suggests that kids might actually walk away from the pandemic having benefitted from such turmoil in their young lives.“As a silver lining, it’s my hope that kids have become more adaptable for no other reason than they’ve been asked to adapt.”Cox says that over time, when we’re able to put some distance between ourselves and the pandemic, “those stressors on kids will reduce.”In the meantime, she reminds parents to keep in mind how these current hard times might benefit kids later in life: “Prior exposure to trauma can increase resilience because there’s that experience of having survived something and knowing that one can survive something else.”

The great COVID-19 infodemic: How disinformation networks are radicalizing Canadians

‘It’s killing people’: The great COVID-19 infodemic






More must be done to combat COVID-19 disinformation sharing in Canada, researcher says – Dec 27, 2021







A common refrain of those opposed to vaccines is that immunizations are harmful to people’s health and an infringement on human rights. Any kind of science proving the efficacy of any vaccine is often denied.In 2021, those health concerns have mutated into a widespread belief among the most staunchly anti-vaccine that if you receive a COVID-19 vaccine dose, you will almost certainly die.The latter is a baseless conspiracy theory. But tens of thousands of Canadians believe it’s true and have created social media channels to promote it.In an attempt to find the nucleus of the Canadian misinformation campaign, I spent a month immersed in the online world of anti-vaccine communities across the country.I joined anti vaccine and anti-mandate groups on Telegram and Facebook, witnessing them transform from meeting places for the unvaccinated to a virtual confluence of hatred and disinformation — where I observed, for instance, calls for medical experts to be hanged and people comparing mass vaccination to genocide.Alongside organizing countrywide anti-vaccine rallies, tens of thousands of Canadians are sharing fake news stories around rising stillbirth numbers, deaths caused by the COVID-19 vaccine and baseless theories of an impending social credit system that begins with QR codes.Many of the people in these groups seem to believe all of this, despite a lack of proof. 


				The social networks			

   Advertisement



 The COVID-19 “infodemic” — the spread of misinformation alongside the spread of a virus — has been described as one of the greatest threats to overcoming the pandemic. But it’s also nothing new; false narratives swirled around the polio vaccine in the 1950s, too. The major difference in 2021, is that we have social media.While social media giants such as Facebook and Twitter say they are doing their best to stamp out COVID-19 misinformation, such groups continue to hide in plain sight. All they’ve done is gotten more creative with their names; searches for “anti vaccine Canada” won’t turn up any results, but plug in synonyms for “freedom” or “unity” and “Canada” and you’ll find plenty.Others have migrated to alternative messaging sites such as Telegram. This is where you’ll find “Unvaxxed Canada,” “Vaccine Choice Canada” and “BC Interior Freedom Fighters” and the various region-specific and career-specific groups they have spawned, which include hundreds of members regularly espousing anti-vaccine sentiments. There are now groups for unvaccinated healthcare workers, teachers, police officers and federal employees.

				Job sites for unvaccinated thrive as vaccine mandates exclude employees				

Many share links to petitions challenging vaccine mandates, links to fake news stories about exaggerated vaccine side effects, and despite the inherent distrust of the mainstream media, links to news articles in the mainstream media. Information is shared about public venues — gyms and restaurants, mostly — not enforcing vaccine mandates. Channels of businesses against mandates exist with thousands of subscribers.It’s impossible to tell how many channels there are, as new ones pop up every few days. Participant numbers in each channel range between a few hundred to 50,000 — and they’re growing.

					Canada Unity, an anti-vaccine group, now has more than 40,000 members.				



A month ago, “Canada Unity,” a Facebook group regularly sharing anti-vaccine posts and misinformation, had 32,000 members. It now has 40,500. Vaccine Choice Canada on Telegram grew by 1,000 members to 15,773, and Unvaxxed Canada, while having only 750 members, has spawned at least 15 separate regional groups.By-and-large, this is not the realm of the vaccine-hesitant. This is thousands of people hell-bent on telling you that the virus does not exist, the vaccine is a bioweapon designed to kill, and the unvaccinated are the only ones “awake” to mass genocide.A COVID-19 “informational” video for Vaccine Choice Canada, a group founded in the 1980s, that says it’s against vaccine mandates, relies almost solely on disinformation. The video asserts that vaccines “alter” people’s DNA, that there is no clinical evidence the vaccine is effective, and that proven low-cost medications are being kept off the market.It follows a rule that emerges very clearly after you join: that most narratives fly in the face of real, verified medical information.

Trudeau says feds ‘very concerned’ over Omicron COVID-19 outlook






Trudeau says feds ‘very concerned’ over Omicron COVID-19 outlook – Dec 13, 2021

Of the main vaccines approved for use in Canada, the Pfizer vaccine has proven to be 95 per cent effective in protecting people from catching COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, while the Moderna vaccine was 94.1 per cent effective and AstraZeneca was 62 per cent.That has, however, changed recently in the face of the Omicron variant. A two-dose Pfizer/BioNTech vaccination now provides just 33 per cent protection against infection against Omicron, but 70 per cent protection against hospitalization, according to a large-scale analysis in South Africa. However, public health advice has not changed: vaccination remains the strongest line of defence against severe illness.But science is routinely cast aside in these groups. Dissent against disinformation is rarely seen. Only in recent days have comments begun to appear questioning the veracity of random posts.“People need to stop posting s–t they read on the internet, do your research, you aren’t helping,” someone says in “Unvaxxed Canada” under a false claim that Sobey’s is no longer accepting unvaccinated shoppers.Posts directly underneath are of an old hoax stating Apple will remove Telegram from phones without notice, a Tiktok video reacting to a Miami school citing discredited info in a policy for vaccinated students to stay home for 30 days (a rule which was later scrapped), and a video of U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson with a caption supposedly announcing “93 per cent of PCR tests don’t work.”  Advertisement



 This caption is false. Johnson was being interviewed about the limitations of airport testing.None of these were questioned. 


				The theories			

Most mid-sized channels, of a few thousand participants, share hundreds of comments per day. Mostly, they assert the pandemic is a hoax or its dangers have been overstated and the media and the pharmaceutical industry are knowingly suppressing this information.Memes about the “asleep,” or vaccinated, portion of society — 87 per cent of Canadians aged over 12 — underline the theory that people are only taking vaccines out of fear, cowering behind their masks, as the unvaccinated fight for freedom.It seems ironic then, that fear seems to be fueling much of their own narrative.

					A Telegram channel discusses Covid-19 vaccine efficacy in children.				



A new lexicon fuels emotion. People aren’t just unvaccinated anymore, they’re “unstabbed,” “unjabbed,” and the Harry Potter-esque, “pure bloods.”The vaccine is a “death shot,” “death jab,” “suicide pill” (despite the vaccine being an injection), “quackzeen,” “clot shot,” “witches brew,” “frankenjab.” The pandemic becomes “plandemic.”Coupled with pseudoscientific content from non-experts, anti-vaxxers have created an alternative world.Comments accuse the government of deliberately trying to depopulate an, already quite unpopulated, country. A message regularly appears from Ontario MPP Randy Hillier, posted on Hillier’s Facebook page on Nov. 15, falsely claiming Public Health Ontario (PHO) is investigating 37 possible deaths due to vaccines. 
Read more: 

				Ontario MPPs vote unanimously to condemn Randy Hillier’s COVID-19 posts				

Hillier’s claim is not true. PHO does not investigate deaths after vaccines, the Ministry of Health does. The ministry investigates all deaths categorized as “near the period of time where an individual received a COVID-19 vaccine.”Since the start of the pandemic, Ontario has recorded eight deaths that met the provincial definition for an adverse event following immunization (AEFI). However, “these reports have not been clearly attributed to other causes and should not be interpreted as causally related with a COVID-19 vaccine,” PHO said in a statement.A further 28 deaths had occurred that did not meet the provincial AEFI definition and preliminary information suggested that those who died had “multiple co-morbidities which may be related to the cause of death” and “there has been no association with a vaccine identified at this time.”“Public Health Ontario is not investigating any of these reports,” a spokesperson said.When contacted, Hillier stood by his statements, claiming that deaths and adverse events were not being properly recorded by PHO. He said people should be “skeptical” of the vaccines and should be doing what was best for themselves rather than the wider population. He said he had never followed any public health advice on masks or social distancing and had “never been sick,” but admitted he had never taken a COVID-19 test. 
Read more:

				Fact check — COVID-19 vaccines are not causing a rise in stillbirths in Canada				

 In reality, very few deaths can be definitively linked to the vaccines in Canada. According to federal data, 248 deaths have occurred following the administration of 61.5 million vaccine doses. However, 88 are “unlikely” linked to the vaccine, 119 could not be assessed due to insufficient information and 41 are under investigation. This pales in comparison to the number of COVID-related deaths in Canada, which now stands at 30,012. So this theory, like so many others, actually inadvertently supports vaccine use.Others just rely on no one doing their homework.A recent TikTok video tried to prove there were fewer COVID-19 cases in Toronto than were being announced. The video pointed to the University Health Network’s (UHN) website, which says it was treating three COVID-19 patients. The poster said UHN “represents all five Toronto hospitals.”  Advertisement



 Toronto has about 40 hospitals. UHN is just one provider.





View image in full screen









					A conspiracy theory video on Tiktok falsely claims UHN is the only hospital provider in Toronto.				



Other theories are more sinister. People claim variants are being released by governments on cue. There are parallels drawn between Nazi Germany and Canada; Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Adolf Hitler; concentration camps and isolation facilities.In recent weeks, baseless claims that stillbirths were “exploding” across Canada found a foothold on Telegram. An unverified article claimed there had been 86 stillbirths in six months at an unspecified hospital in Waterloo, Ont. and 13 in an unspecified 24-hour period at a Vancouver hospital.We debunked that theory very quickly, simply by requesting official statistics. Data from the Better Outcomes Registry & Network (BORN), Ontario’s perinatal, newborn and child registry, shows there were between 12 and 15 stillbirths in the entire Waterloo region between January and June 2021. Data from Vancouver Coastal Health from April to late August 2021 reveals there were just four stillbirths across VCH’s seven hospitals in that period.But these theories refuse to die. The same links are shared over and over, existing in a vacuum. 


				The hysteria			

As the weeks drag on, conspiracy theories have grown more outlandish, and far less rooted in any semblance of fact.It was apparent when children were approved for vaccines on Nov. 19.“Starting Tuesday, they’re coming for Canada’s 5 to 11-year-olds,” one person on Telegram wrote.Another said the vaccine would “maim, sterilize and kill their babies.”“I feel bad for the kids of these brainwashed parents. There is zero benefit to these kids but so much potential risk,” another said.

Many say they will take their children out of school. Others employ their sons and daughters at anti-vaccine rallies, proudly posting their pictures, looking confused and uninterested, holding placards that say “human experimentation is illegal” and “children need to breathe.”Links to warnings of the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis (heart inflammations) appear repeatedly, with accusations lobbied at governments and mainstream media for covering it up.But all of this information is freely available online.

				‘Boycott Chapman’s’ — Why anti-vaccine groups are taking aim at ice cream				

Side-effects from the vaccine are possible, of course. But the reason the mainstream media rarely writes about it is because instances are rare and in line with those expected from any vaccine.The government publishes weekly data on adverse side effects. According to the latest data, until Dec. 3, of the 61.5 million vaccine doses administered in Canada, there have been 28,825 adverse event reports (0.047 per cent of all doses administered). Of those, 6,581 were considered serious (0.011 per cent of all doses). The most common side effects were tingling or prickling, vaccine site pain and headaches.Myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported in 1,428 patients across the country (0.0023 per cent of all doses), in the same time frame.

The risk of either disease is substantially more after a COVID-19 infection itself. In a study of hospitalized people of all ages in the United States between March 2020 and January 2021, the risk of myocarditis was 16 times higher for people with COVID-19 infections.  Advertisement



 Another conspiracy theory insists the recent devastating floods in B.C. were planned as a distraction tactic as vaccinations ramped up. There’s a listicle of people who have had a leg amputated after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, hosted on a vaccine misinformation website. There’s a list of hundreds of professional soccer players who have recently died, or collapsed while playing, with unverified claims they were all vaccinated. There’s a paper on Pfizer’s “global war to abuse and attempt to murder as many children as possible with their deadly COVID-19 injections.”Things get extremely meta one day when one person asks: “What if this channel is for nothing more than tracking and documenting the unvaxxed in order to pinpoint their relative locations?”All of these conspiracy theories would be easily debunked with one simple question: “Why?”But nobody asks. 


				The public distrust			

Distrust of doctors and media is openly encouraged. Rallies are organized outside hospitals.“Terrorists these days wear suits, ties and white coats,” one commenter says.“The pure bloods know to stay away from hospitals because the vaccinated doctors and nurses will kill them,” another says.People call for boycotts of just about any company enforcing mandates. The Chapman’s ice-cream boycott began on Telegram.

					Someone posts an offer for a fake Covid-19 vaccine certificate on Telegram.				



The lines between the anti-vaccine movement and the far-right continue to blur. Anti-abortion, anti-Islam and anti-5G comments are common.There are promises of fake vaccine cards, offering QR codes and information uploaded into “the Pfizer website” for a fee of between $400 and $1,000. They appear to be scams. But it doesn’t matter anyway; the unvaccinated say this would be inadvertently complying with the rules. 


				The vortex			

As time goes on, it becomes clear why the pull of these dark holes of distrust have become so powerful: because the very same technology companies who are vowing to combat them are inadvertently promoting them, via algorithms that boost pages you most engage with.The more time I spend on anti-vaccine groups on Facebook, the more they top my news feed, becoming so entwined with friends’ pregnancy and new job announcements, that it’s difficult to discern which is which. Disinformation is now being offered up to me before my morning coffee.It is also platform-agnostic. Conspiracy theories shared on Telegram will later appear on Facebook and Twitter, and vice-versa. Tiktok videos are downloaded and shared on other platforms. If you’re a member of one platform, you’re consuming all of the above.

Biden says social media sites like Facebook ‘are killing people’ by spreading COVID-19 disinformation






Biden says social media sites like Facebook ‘are killing people’ by spreading COVID-19 disinformation – Jul 16, 2021

Facebook has long defended its fight against misinformation. It introduced social media stickers to show users when friends and family get vaccinated, display warnings on COVID-19 information that fact checkers have deemed false, and added labels to posts that discuss vaccines.  Advertisement



 In a statement, Alex Kucharski, Meta (Facebook’s parent company) Canada’s communications manager said 24 million pieces of content from Facebook and Instagram have been removed globally for violating misinformation policies. The company would not release Canada-specific data or answer specific questions about its misinformation policies.“Meta is committed to not only fighting the spread of harmful health information on our platforms, but also working to ensure Canadians have access to reliable information to make informed decisions about their health,” Kucharski said. 


				The participants			

But then, the virus breaks the anti-vaccine ranks without a hint of irony.A man told a Telegram channel in early December that his entire family had contracted COVID-19.“My wife and I are very sick. It’s no joke,” he wrote, asking for help.Some compared experiences. Others post recipes for “homemade hydroxychloroquine” or suggest going to buy ivermectin, both unverified treatments for COVID-19.

The conversation then returns to how the vaccine is killing people and not the virus.It’s difficult to determine exactly who these people are. Results from cycle two of the Public Health Agency of Canada’s COVID-19 vaccination coverage survey released earlier this year showed, of the five per cent of Canadians who did not intend to get vaccinated, they tended to be younger, male, have less than a post-secondary education, and a household income of less than $60,000.This data was recently posted in an anti-vaccine channel — with the poster asserting those with lower education levels were the most “awake.”High-profile purveyors of anti-vaccine sentiments are portrayed as heroes. U.S. President Donald Trump is revered, as are discredited medical professionals.Advertisements promote a speaker series of prominent “activists”: David Icke,  Americans Ty and Charlene Bollinger, infamous Canadian anti-vaccine protestor Chris Sky (Saccocia). Though Sky boasts more than 50,000 Telegram subscribers, some of the unvaccinated now label him a “grifter” and ask for his videos to be removed from public channels.

Queen’s University assistant professor and family doctor Michelle Cohen, who has been researching Canada’s infodemic, says the anti-vaccine movement is “laundering” false information through some right-wing politicians and former medical professionals to legitimize “whatever lies they want.”“It’s giving a kind of a legitimizing gloss to the political movement,” she says.“They’re so completely within their echo chambers of their own media, that they’re just within this little universe, and it doesn’t really matter what criticism they get from the outside. But then in the meantime, these echo chambers are just proliferating.”Cohen says that despite the anti-vaccine movement representing a small portion of society, its ideologies are seeping into right-wing politics.“This feels like it’s gone from being just like, ‘Oh, this is just in the alternative world. And this is just a conspiracy theory, we can kind of ignore it,’ to ‘This has pulled growing political power.'”She believes more needs to be done, at a federal and provincial level, to counter the flow of false information.Fact checking is routinely eschewed because people are “tribally associated” with the movement and the community, she says.“You can really develop a solid-like bulletproof echo chamber that no facts can penetrate.” 


				The line in the sand

 What has become abundantly clear is that being anti-vaccine is no longer simply a personal choice — it is a way of life for many. A line in the sand has been drawn in recent weeks, as workplace mandates come into force.In one channel, someone posits the question: “Any unvaccinated guys here having trouble finding unvaccinated women in Ontario/ Quebec?”Someone replies: “Vaxxed women are sterile and can spread their spike proteins.”Another says the vaccine can be shared via sexual intercourse. Another says they don’t want any vaccinated people in their house.“Human shedding” of the virus is impossible. COVID-19 vaccines in Canada do not contain the live virus, and thus it is not possible for any “viral shedding” to occur.

					Unvaccinated people on a Telegram channel speak about navigating the world of dating during the pandemic.				



One woman says her husband got vaccinated while she was out of town and she no longer feels she can be intimate with him. Another woman says her boyfriend did the same, so she has been avoiding him.“I would never lie to a woman about my vaccination status. In fact, it’s the first thing I ask now to women. If they’re vaxxed, I move on,” the original poster says.“That’s hot,” a woman replies.“Thx. You from Qbc/Ontario?”Someone asks if there are any unvaxxed dating sites yet. Apparently there are.Someone says they’ve been barred from a family Christmas lunch for being unvaccinated. Another recounts cutting off his own family.“I don’t regret walking away from any of my control freak braindead blood relatives because there’s so much more time for meeting new spiritual family, like many of you.” 


				The lack of action			

Despite the retweets and hashtags, these groups have had little impact outside of their virtual bubbles. Rallies continue, but accomplish little more than a few hours of traffic disruption. Petitions and potential lawsuits are routinely threatened — some solicit for money to fund them — but continue to fail.The latest call to action is for people to carry black marker pens to scribble on QR codes in public places — thus, they say, rendering them ineffective. But, the campaign itself seems ineffective, too.“I tried it and it didn’t work,” one poster wrote.

Despite weeks of threatening that rights were being impeded and lawsuits would be filed with airlines, on Nov. 30, it still became illegal for the unvaccinated to travel on domestic planes or trains. Comments were of defiance.“Travel these days must be a nightmare anyway.”Four weeks in, and defeatist attitudes are beginning to show. Someone posts a poll asking: “Have you decided to pack up and leave Canada?”Sixty-five per cent respond that they are “thinking about leaving.”

The Kamchatka Peninsula?“It is nice to see that there is a large group of independent thinkers out there,” someone says. “There are good people in the world.”“Happy to be onboard with you all,” another writes.

For nearly two years, the COVID-19 pandemic has thrown countless curve balls at Canadians and it shows no sign of stopping.
Enter Omicron, a new variant that is spreading quickly and replacing the Delta variant as the dominant strain in several countries.Many scientists are studying the mutation, seeking to provide answers to the hundreds of questions being asked.Here is what we know about Omicron so far. Much of this could change, and when it does, this post will be updated as needed. 


				Where was Omicron found?			

Towards the end of November, COVID-19 infections in South Africa began increasing steeply. While studying the spike, scientists came across a new mutation on Nov. 24.  Story continues below advertisement



 Shortly after its discovery, South African officials alerted the world to the new variant. Two days after the mutation was found, the World Health Organization designated it a variant of concern, as it had previously with Delta and Alpha, and named it Omicron.Since its discovery, Omicron has been confirmed to be found in 149 countries, including Canada, according to WHO, with cases doubling every two to three days.Omicron’s “substantial growth advantage” over the Delta variant means it is likely to soon overtake it as the dominant variant in those countries, the U.N. health agency said.According to the WHO, Omicron poses a “very high” risk to the world’s fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.

COVID-19: WHO cautions dismissing Omicron variant as ‘mild’ – Jan 6, 2022

 


				Omicron symptoms			

Some preliminary evidence has emerged about Omicron, including its symptoms, which seem to be slightly different from Delta according to Dr. Angelique Coetzee, chair of South Africa’s medical association. She recently told Global News that patients she’s aware of are reporting headaches and body aches, and a slight sore throat.  Story continues below advertisement



 Commonly reported symptoms of Omicron included cough, fatigue and congestion or runny nose, according to the WHO. It cited U.S. data during the update, which the WHO said looked at 43 partially and fully vaccinated individuals who were infected with Omicron, the majority being 18 to 39 years of age.

COVID-19: WHO sees more evidence that Omicron variant causes milder symptoms – Jan 4, 2022

Recently, the WHO reported growing evidence that Omicron is causing milder symptoms, and that it’s affecting the upper part of the body.However, the WHO cites that early data suggests severity increases with age and in the presence of underlying medical conditions, as well as among people who are not vaccinated.“Also, current evidence about severity and hospitalization comes largely from countries with high levels of population immunity, and there remains uncertainty about the severity of Omicron in populations with different vaccination coverage and prior exposure to other variants,” the agency said on Jan. 7.  Story continues below advertisement



  


				How fast does Omicron spread? 			

The transmissibility of Omicron has concerned researchers worldwide, and Canadian officials have projected that if it replaces Delta as the dominant strain in the country, daily infections could hit 26,600 a day nationally by mid-January.Ontario — the only province tracking Omicron’s reproductive rate — has reported that it’s infecting almost two times as many people as the Delta variant.

 On Jan. 7, Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam said Omicron is now the “predominant strain” of the virus in the country.

Studies are emerging with encouraging results on the severity of Omicron. The WHO has acknowledged that Omicron appears to cause less severe disease, but it shouldn’t be called “mild.”In Ontario, researchers announced on Dec. 30 they found the risk of hospitalization or death was 54 per cent lower for Omicron cases as compared to Delta cases. Researchers examined more than 6,000 cases between Nov. 22 and Dec. 17, but warn due to the transmissibility of Omicron, “the absolute number of hospitalizations and impact on the health-care system is likely to be significant.”The U.K. Health Security Agency announced on Dec. 23 its findings that those with the Omicron variant were 50 to 70 per cent less likely to be hospitalized compared to those with Delta. One researcher called the finding from preliminary data “a small ray of sunlight.”

Meanwhile, Imperial College London published a study a day earlier that showed that those infected with Omicron were around 20 per cent less likely to go to the hospital at all than those who have the Delta variant, and 40 per cent less likely to be hospitalized for a night or more.  Story continues below advertisement



 The analysis was based on all COVID-19 cases confirmed by PCR tests in England in the first half of December, of which there were 56,000 cases of Omicron and 269,000 cases of Delta.

Earlier data out of South Africa also showed that Omicron is causing less severe illness than other variants. According to South Africa’s National Institute for Communicable Diseases, only 30 per cent of those hospitalized with COVID-19 in recent weeks have been seriously ill.Omicron’s impact on the elderly is still one of the big unanswered questions as most of the cases studied so far have been in younger people.

				How many vaccinated are being infected			

   Story continues below advertisement



 The WHO said Jan. 7 there is preliminary data from multiple non-peer reviewed studies suggesting that there is a reduction in protection against Omicron in individuals who have received two-vaccine doses and in those previously infected with COVID-19.Also, increased risk of reinfection has been reported in South Africa, the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Israel, all suggesting immune evasion against Omicron.





The recent numbers emerging from the province can provide a snapshot of how Canadians with different vaccination statuses are faring against the variant.The Ontario government’s latest figures indicate 80 per cent of cases were among the fully vaccinated. According to the government, 82 per cent of Ontario’s eligible population five and older are fully inoculated. 


				How effective are vaccines against Omicron?			

Vaccines are still one of the best ways to protect yourself against COVID-19, according to Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada’s top doctor.  Story continues below advertisement



 Speaking to reporters on Dec. 13, she urged those who “haven’t had the vaccine” to “get the first and second doses, including the younger children.”However, that doesn’t mean vaccines don’t offer some measure of protection. Early studies show that the vaccines are still very effective at keeping you out of the hospital if you catch Omicron.





Pfizer: According to the latest findings from South Africa, people who are double vaccinated against COVID-19 with the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine have 33 per cent protection against Omicron infection. However, the vaccine offered 70 per cent protection against hospitalization, according to Discovery Health, South Africa’s largest private health insurer, and the South African Medical Research Council.Moderna: Moderna’s efficacy against Omicron was tested alongside Pfizer’s in research done at the University of California. That research – which has yet to be peer-reviewed – found that after two doses of an mRNA vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna, efficacy against symptomatic infection from Omicron is only about 30 per cent – down from about 87 per cent versus Delta. The findings were later supported in pre-publication research from Moderna, which also found Moderna is less effective against Omicron.The researchers added that protection against severe disease still sat around 86 per cent for recent mRNA vaccination against Omicron, and 67 per cent for waned immunity, according to Reuters.  Story continues below advertisement



  


				How effective are the boosters at fighting Omicron?			

The most important thing Canadians can do now is follow public health advice and “get your booster shots,” Tam said.The early findings about boosters are promising. The United States’ top doctor, Anthony Fauci, has said that “booster vaccine regimens work against Omicron,” whether your dose is Pfizer or Moderna. He cited new data from the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).Research from the University of California indicates boosters can push protection against Omicron infection back up to roughly 48 per cent. As for preventing severe disease, boosters appear to push that efficacy back up to 91 per cent.

A study released in the United Kingdom also found a COVID booster shot can provide 71 to 75 per cent against mild symptoms of COVID-19.  Story continues below advertisement



 Moderna recently shared a half dose of its vaccine as a booster increased neutralizing antibodies against Omicron 37 fold. A full shot as a booster dose of the same vaccine drove antibody levels even higher – more than 80 times pre-boost levels.A Danish study released late last month indicated that a third dose of either Pfizer or Moderna offers a “significant increase” in protection against Omicron in elderly people.The WHO also said Jan. 7 that booster shots increase vaccine effectiveness. 


				How effective are treatments at battling Omicron?			

New COVID-19 treatments are also showing promising signs when it comes to the Omicron variant. Pfizer said on Dec. 14 its experimental COVID-19 pill appears to be effective against the Omicron variant.The full results of Pfizer’s 2,250-person study found the drug reduced combined hospitalizations and deaths by about 89 per cent among high-risk adults when taken shortly after initial COVID-19 symptoms.  Story continues below advertisement



 Separate laboratory testing also showed that the drug still works when it faces off against the Omicron variant, according to Pfizer.

It was approved for use in the United States by the FDA recently.Merck’s treatment is still under Health Canada review.  Story continues below advertisement



  


				What Omicron means for COVID-19 restrictions 			

Since Omicron’s emergence in Canada, governments have been introducing restrictions to slow its spread.It began with travel restrictions from countries in Africa where the variant was discovered. Then at the federal level, the government advised against non-essential international travel as cases spiked worldwide.Ahead of the holidays, governments in Canada began imposing restrictions to limit community spread, and they have continued to be introduced in January.

Ontario, which has reported record-breaking daily COVID-19 infections, has introduced a near province-wide shutdown to slow Omicron’s spread and preserve hospital capacity. Indoor dining, gyms and theatres are among the activities Ontarians can no longer do until Jan. 26 at the earliest.  Story continues below advertisement



 In Quebec, the government introduced a curfew in addition to other measures to calm record infection numbers in the province.Every province except Saskatchewan has delayed the return to in-person schooling as well to the dismay of parents and students who wanted to return to classes following the holidays.

				Why Omicron after Delta			

The World Health Organization (WHO) skipped two letters in the Greek alphabet in going from Delta to Omicron when naming the most recent SARS-CoV-2 variant.  Story continues below advertisement



 The name Omicron comes after “nu” and “xi” in the alphabet, which the WHO said they skipped to avoid confusing the public and causing offence.“`Nu’ is too easily confounded with ‘new,’ and `xi’ was not used because it is a common last name,” the WHO wrote in a statement to the Associated Press.The organization added that it is not their intent to cause any “offence to any cultural, social, national, regional, professional or ethnic groups.” It is the first time the WHO skipped over a letter to name a variant.

How student loan debt became a crisis
“Increases in financial aid in recent years have enabled colleges and universities to blithely raise their tuitions, confident that federal loan subsidies would help cushion the increase.”

                  By Shirin Ali & Adam Barnes | March 23, 2022 









            In this Nov. 9, 2017, file photo people walk by Old Main on the Penn State University main campus in State College, Pa.Gene J. Puskar/ AP 


Story at a glance

 As President Biden is under increasing pressure to issue blanket student loan forgiveness, the rise of college tuition remains a glaring issue. 
 Between 1980 and 2019 college fees rose by 169 percent, while wages for young workers aged 22 to 27 went up by 19 percent over the same period.  
 That’s partly due to a policy change Congress made in 2010, vastly expanding access to federal student loans, enabling debt and tuition price hikes. 
 

President Biden is under mounting pressure to address the student loan debt crisis with lawmakers urging him to issue blanket forgiveness. However, outstanding loan debt is only one part of the problem as soaring tuition costs and an increasing availability to federal loans continues to drive the crisis. The student debt crisis so far has led 43 million borrowers to collectively owe around $1.6 trillion. Some of the main drivers of that growing debt are rising tuition costs and increased federal loan availability — further exacerbated by corresponding wage stagnation. Tuition costs are a crisis of their own, something former Secretary of Education William J. Bennett foresaw decades ago in 1987. Bennett argued in an opinion piece that “increases in financial aid in recent years have enabled colleges and universities to blithely raise their tuitions, confident that federal loan subsidies would help cushion the increase.” A pandemic-related freeze on student loan payments beginning in March 2020 has now been extended five times across two administrations, and lawmakers are calling on the president to again extend the moratorium set to expire May 1. Democratic lawmakers have also argued that not extending the pause is a risky maneuver during a midterm election year.  Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) recently called on the president to cancel up to $50,000 worth of loans per borrower as the costs of food and gas rise amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but Jayapal upped the ante on Sunday urging Biden to cancel all student debt.  “Extending the payment pause just isn’t enough,” Jayapal wrote on Twitter. “We need to cancel every last penny of student debt, once and for all.” America is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news. Tackling current outstanding debt may ease the financial burden for millions of borrowers, freeing up income to purchase a car or invest in a home. However, that move would not prevent future borrowers from entering into the same debt crisis.  Collective student debt increased by 144 percent over a 13-year period from 2007 to 2020, moving from $642 billion to $1.566 trillion, according to a 2020 report published by the Bipartisan Policy Center (BPC). During the same period the number of borrowers increased from 28 million to 43 million. The report ties both issues partly to the rise in unemployment caused by the Great Recession beginning in 2007. The recession led to policy shifts, including an expansion of the Federal Direct Loan program. Before the overhaul, most federal loans were handled by private lenders with the federal government footing the bill in case of a default. But Congress expanded the program in 2010, allowing the government to issue all federal loans using funds from the Treasury Department.  That move proved to be monumental, as it increased access to student loans and created a “vicious cycle of rising tuition and higher debt loads,” BPC explained. With more students gaining access to funding, colleges and universities could begin charging higher tuition prices without any serious drops in enrollment. Published tuition rates at colleges and universities rose by 60 cents for every dollar increase in the annual lending limit for Federal Direct Subsidized Loans.  That shift saw near-immediate effects, with BPC’s report noting that federal student debt grew to 6.6 percent of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2015, compared to only 3.5 percent in 2007.Meanwhile, the cost of college has doubled in the past two decades and is growing each year by 6.8 percent according to The Education Data Initiative. Data shows the average cost to attend an in-state public school for one year is $25,487. Students attending private schools pay nearly twice as much as the average single-year cost doling out around $53,217. Both numbers cover tuition, fees and additional expenses.Yet the price of college has far exceeded the corresponding wage increase by more than 100 percent over the past four decades, according to analysis of education data by Georgetown University last fall. Between 1980 and 2019 college fees rose by 169 percent, while wages for young workers aged 22 to 27 went up by 19 percent over the same period.Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) brought the issue to the fore on social media earlier this week, again calling on the president to cancel student debt, an issue he has previously expressed willingness to consider both early in his presidency and on the campaign trail.   “I graduated from a state school that cost $50 a semester,” Warren wrote on Twitter. “Every person in America should be able to go to college without being crushed by student debt.”   READ MORE STORIES FROM CHANGING AMERICA NASA’S MARS HELICOPTER WILL CONTINUE FLYING ON RED PLANET WOLVERINE CAPTURED, COLLARED IN ‘ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME EXPERIENCE’ FOR UTAH RESEARCHERS  HEAVY ALCOHOL USE LINKED TO 232M MISSED WORKDAYS IN US EACH YEAR WHAT HAPPENS IF BIDEN CANCELS STUDENT LOANS? FLORIDA’S FIRST OPENLY GAY STATE SENATOR ON ‘DON’T SAY GAY’ PASSING: ‘THE AIR WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE ROOM’

    The Rooney Rule Didn’t Solve the NFL’s Hiring Issues
  
Article In The Thread

Jason Stewart

March 22, 2022

32 NFL teams31 NFL team owners1,696 players on starting rosters1,183 players of color on those starting rosters2 African American head coaches0 African American majority team ownersThis is the National Football League.In 2003, the NFL, commonly known as The Shield, instituted a new policy known as the “Rooney Rule.” Created in an attempt to address the league’s lack of diversity in hiring practices, the rule requires that every NFL team must interview at least one candidate of color for any open head coaching position. Since the rule’s implementation, of the 121 open head coaching positions, there have only been a total of 18 African Americans hired as head coaches.Brian Flores, one of those 18, was head coach of the Miami Dolphins from 2019 until he was unexpectedly fired earlier this year after three seasons for “organizational strife,” as suggested by team owner Stephen Ross. During his time, Flores led the Dolphins to two consecutive winning seasons — a feat no other coach in Miami has been able to accomplish since 2002. A few weeks after his firing, on Feb. 1, Flores sent shockwaves across the world of sports when he filed a class action lawsuit against the NFL and three teams, Miami Dolphins, Denver Broncos, and New York Giants, alleging racial discrimination in their head coach hiring practices, alongside other damning allegations.Flores, who interviewed with both the Denver Broncos and the New York Giants for head coaching positions, alleges that then-Broncos General Manager John Elway and two other team executives showed up an hour late to the interview, looking “disheveled” and that “it was obvious they had been heavily drinking the night before.” Flores referred to these interviews as a “sham,” meant only to fulfill the league’s quota in interviewing minority candidates for head coaching positions. Further allegations from Flores accuse the owner of the Miami Dolphins, Stephen Ross, of offering to pay him $100,000 per game to purposely lose games, so that the team could receive a higher draft pick.We’ve seen these types of allegations before. In 2019, former head coach of the Cleveland Browns Hue Jackson alleged that the bonuses he was paid were for losing games and that the team didn't make an effort to develop or acquire players to improve the team. Both team owners Stephen Ross and Jimmy Haslam have denied these accusations. One particular theory to explain the claims of Jackson and Flores, known as the “glass cliff theory” argues that “members of underrepresented groups are most likely to be hired by organizations that have a history of poor performance or that are in crisis.” In other words, both Jackson and Flores were both hired by teams with a history of poor performances, in order to take the fall.Flores’s situation exemplifies how people of color, and African American coaches in particular, are treated as the most expendable and the most undervalued when it comes to leadership roles. So why is it, in a league with majority African American talent in playing positions (71% in the 2021 season), that African American coaches are routinely overlooked, coerced to fail on purpose, or dismissed? Brian Flores’s lawsuit has exposed the widespread discontent among African American and POC coaches over NFL hiring practices.But these racist hiring practices are not just limited to the NFL. In a controversial television interview in April 1986, Al Campanais, the then-vice president and director of player personnel of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team, infamously said that, “They [Black people] may not have the necessities to be a field manager or perhaps a general manager.” This type of myopic thinking has been passed along for generations throughout various sporting leagues. Similar to the Rooney Rule, Major League Baseball (MLB) instituted the “Selig Rule” in 1999, requiring at least one minority candidate to be interviewed for every managerial or front office opening. The MLB is still a majority white sport, and the rule has made candidates of color feel like a box to check off rather than a real option.So why is it, in a league with majority African American talent in playing positions… that African American coaches are routinely overlooked, coerced to fail on purpose, or dismissed?The National Basketball Association (NBA), another majority African American player league at approximately 73 percent, currently has only one African American majority team owner: Michael Jordan. Jordan was preceded as majority team owner by Robert Johnson, the founder of Black Entertainment Television, as the first African American majority owner in the NBA. Comparatively, the NFL does not have a single African American majority team owner. And the racial injustices are perpetuated on all levels, not only within the team’s coaching and managerial staffs. Players also face discriminatory treatment. There is unmentioned conventional thinking that athletes of color should just shut up and play the game, or just be happy that they are making large sums of money, and they shouldn’t use their status or voice to advocate for an injustice, preserving the laborer-vs.-owner mentality.Colin Kaepernick sacrificed his NFL career in order to speak out against injustice, while playing in a league that practiced inequality in its hiring. Not only are current players mistreated, former players also experience continued racism when it comes to medical settlements for injuries sustained during their playing years. In June of 2021, the NFL finally agreed to stop the controversial practice of ""race norming,"" which assumed that African American athletes started with lower cognitive functions than white athletes. The NFL’s use of race norming made headlines last summer when two former players filed a lawsuit against the NFL for its application to concussion settlements for former players. African American players were deliberately paid less for brain diseases developed as a result of prolonged head injuries sustained from the sport because doctors applied “African American normative corrections” to players’ cognitive function tests.Since his firing and filing his lawsuit, Brian Flores has been hired by the Pittsburgh Steelers as a senior defensive assistant and linebackers coach, joining one of the few Black head coaches in the league, Mike Tomlin. But even with this new role, one that he is surely overqualified for, Flores plans to move forward with the lawsuit “so that real change can be made.”When will this end? Will Flores’s lawsuit bring about actual change? In sports there are so many instances of a system that keeps allowing white men to dominate all spaces, including predominantly POC spaces. Systemic racism that is perpetuated through societal norms is reflected in our country’s biggest sporting leagues, from the NFL to the NCAA, to the National Hockey League, professional golf, NASCAR, and more.At its core, the agenda of the league and its owners is clear: a desire for financial gain and to keep an unrelenting grip on power that continuously reinforces and widens the wealth and class gap in this country.This is the world of sports, this is the NFL, this is The Shield.The Shield has been tarnished.

But as the taboo surrounding modified athletes lessens, new questions arise: Are we equipped to deal with the legal and ethical implications that will inevitably emerge as a result?Timeout. Do We Need to Rethink Our Relationship with Sports? (Future Tense, 2020): Since COVID-19 hit in 2019, we have not only stopped or limited in-person meet-ups and interactions, but we have also become more divided as a nation. But could large sporting events help Americans build back a sense of community? And is technology a possible substitute for repairing this collective bond?The Sports Binary: The Restrictive Practice of Sex Verification Testing (The Thread, 2021): Gender verification testing has become a controversial staple that many Olympic athletes have endured, which has resulted in discrimination towards women deemed too “strong” or “masculine.” As some athletes have even attempted/committed suicide due to gender testing, how ethical, really, is it?
