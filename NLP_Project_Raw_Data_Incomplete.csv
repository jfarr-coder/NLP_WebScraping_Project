Yahoo,Putin's war in Ukraine 'should concern every person on Earth': Why political observers say the Russian observers say teh Russian invasion may foretell an era of...,I,"Could the war in Ukraine mark the beginning of a new era defined by global unrest and power grabs?

That’s what some political observers are suggesting. In the days leading up to Russia’s invasion of its neighboring country, commentators and officials were framing a potential war as one with much larger implications — not just for Eastern Europe or all of Europe, but for all the world.

At heart is the concern that following a post-World War II period in which countries, especially superpowers, rarely imposed their will on others through military means, the Ukrainian war could signal a different — and decidedly more dangerous — approach.

“The Russian threat to invade Ukraine should concern every person on Earth,” wrote historian and philosopher Yuval Noah Harari in The Economist. “If it again becomes normative for powerful countries to wolf down their weaker neighbors, it would affect the way people all over the world feel and behave.”

Ulrich Speck, an expert on global order, expressed a similar sentiment to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, though he focused mainly on the Ukrainian situation’s implications for Europe. He noted that citizens of the continent had become accustomed to the idea of living in an era “where soft power replaced hard power and international law created the foundation of a mutually beneficial order.”

And now? “All these assumptions are being questioned,” Speck said. “Old-style power politics are back.”
David E. Sanger, White House and national security correspondent for the New York Times, said the stakes are “very real” in terms of the Ukrainian situation’s broader implications. He pointed to how international agreements, such as those via NATO, created since the fall of the Soviet Union, “have kept Europe secure.” In turn, “most Europeans, and frankly most Americans, have come to just assume (that’s) the way the world is organized.”

But Russian president Vladimir Putin is upending that assumption, Sanger said: “Putin is using this moment and holding Ukraine hostage to say, ‘No, no, no … It may be the way the world was organized for the past 25 years, but it’s not the way we’re willing to have the world organized for the next 25.’”

Frank Bruni, a contributing opinion writer to the Times, put it more bluntly, saying many of us had falsely come to believe that we had entered an “enlightened” — and essentially, war-free — era.

“I don’t know if it’s a boomer thing, a modern thing, an elite thing or some other thing, but in my lifetime, in this country, among many of my generational peers, there has been a sense that people had learned particular lessons and were evolving past extremes of pettiness and barbarism, certainly in the corners of the globe deemed more enlightened,” Bruni wrote.
Clearly, that’s not the case, Bruni added: “Embarrassment, vanity, viciousness: History never moves on or gets past these forces, which drove invasions and conquests in centuries past and will drive invasions and conquests in years to come.”

It isn’t just political observers who are sounding such warning calls. So, too, are political officials. In a January speech in Berlin, U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said that allowing Russia to “violate those principles” of not using force to reshape political borders “would drag us all back to a much more dangerous and unstable time.”

Blinken added that the Russian-Ukranian situation is “bigger than a conflict between two countries…. It’s a crisis with global consequences, and it requires global attention and action.”",https://www.marketwatch.com/story/putins-war-in-ukraine-should-concern-every-person-on-earth-why-political-observers-say-the-russian-invasion-may-foretell-an-era-of-global-disorder-11645731455?siteid=yhoof2,Could the war in Ukraine mark the beginning of a new era defined by global unrest and power grabs?,2022-02-24
The Daily Wire,Colin Kaepernick Offering Free Autopsies For Families Of Those Killed In ‘Police-Related’…,I,"Former NFL quarterback-turned-activist Colin Kaepernick is offering free secondary autopsies through his nonprofit for the family members of anyone killed in a “police-related” incident.

Kaepernick is launching the initiative through his Know Your Rights Camp, which hosts a series of conferences aimed at younger people “to advance the liberation and well-being of Black and Brown communities through education, self-empowerment, mass-mobilization and the creation of new systems.” The activist said that offering free autopsies is a way to protect potential victims against the “prison industrial complex.”


“We know that the prison industrial complex, which includes police and policing, strives to protect and serve its interests at all costs,” Kaepernick said, according to ESPN. “The Autopsy Initiative is one important step toward ensuring that family members have access to accurate and forensically verifiable information about the cause of death of their loved one in their time of need.”

According to the Know Your Rights Camp website, the Autopsy Initiative’s goal is to “provide a second autopsy free-of-charge for victims’ families who have lost their loved ones due to a police-related death. The services offered through the Initiative include the completion of a second autopsy, disclosure of preliminary findings, and issuance of the final autopsy report.”

The website continued:


A police-related death occurs when an individual is harmed by police officers while using deadly force which results in the individual’s death. A police-related death includes in-custody deaths. In-custody deaths include deaths that arise during contact with law enforcement officers during arrest, pursuit, booking, transport, or incarceration. Therefore, pre-custody deaths are included within in-custody deaths. 

Our Initiative includes a team of board-certified pathologists. Our board-certified pathologists will work objectively, efficiently and, diligently while relying on established forensic principles when conducting the second autopsy. Our pathologists will actively seek the truth to provide the victims’ families with the most medically sound cause of death. 

The Autopsy Request may be completed by anyone with a close relationship with the victim, which may include the victim’s spouse, partner, relative, close friend, or lawyer. However, only the victim’s legal representative and/or other authorized individuals can legally authorize the autopsy. 

Kaepernick’s racial-justice activism took off after he kneeled for the national anthem before a game in 2016. He escalated his efforts in 2020 after the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in May 2020. In an essay several months later in October, Kaepernick called for the abolition of police and prisons.

“The central intent of policing is to surveil, terrorize, capture, and kill marginalized populations, specifically Black folks,” Kaepernick wrote. “In order to eradicate anti-Blackness, we must also abolish the police. The abolition of one without the other is impossible.”",https://www.dailywire.com/news/colin-kaepernick-offering-free-autopsies-for-families-of-those-killed-in-police-related-incidents,"Former NFL quarterback-turned-activist Colin Kaepernick is offering free secondary autopsies through his nonprofit for the family members of anyone killed in a “police-related” incident.",2022-02-25
The Daily Wire,Amanda Seyfried Reveals Why She Originally Said No To Playing Elizabeth Holmes In New Hulu…,I,"TV viewers are obsessed with the idea of a con gone wrong, and one of the biggest is the story of Elizabeth Holmes. The disgraced Theranos founder was once heralded as the fastest rising star in the healthcare industry, earning billions from venture capitalists to grow her company. Now, she’s facing up to 20 years in federal prison for multiple convictions of fraud. Holmes’s story is coming to Hulu soon as part of a miniseries called “The Dropout.”

“Mean Girls” alum Amanda Seyfried is taking on the lead role despite turning down the opportunity at first. The actress spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about why she wasn’t hung up on recreating Holmes’s signature deep voice plus the reason she initially didn’t want to sign up for the project. 


Originally, “SNL” actress Kate McKinnon was slated to play Holmes, but she dropped out to join the miniseries “Joe vs Carole.” Seyfried got the offer to replace McKinnon and quickly turned it down.

“Listen, I was having a f***ing moment, OK?” she told THR. “I had COVID. I was isolating in the basement of a gross townhouse in Savannah, Georgia, because my husband was working on a movie there. And now an L.A. shoot? Pass!”

After giving the role some thought and consideration, Seyfried changed her mind and decided to give it a try. However, the actress swears she never tried to completely copy Holmes’s very deep voice. 


“I knew my voice was never going to be as deep as hers because I’m physically not capable of it,” Seyfried told the publication. “Besides, I promised I wasn’t going to give myself a hard time and try to completely mimic this other human being. It’d be impossible. And just not fun.”

The subject of Holmes tricking some of the savviest people in business into believing she had a viable product has been explored before. There’s the best-seller “Bad Blood,” the documentary  “The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley,” and a popular podcast called “The Dropout,” which serves as a major contributor to the new Hulu miniseries.




Despite learning everything there was to know about Holmes, Seyfried insists that the real person behind the con remains a mystery. “I watched and listened to all of it, but I learned nothing about her,” the actress said. “It’s crazy that she can still be such an enigma with all the information surrounding her.”

Elsewhere in the article, screenwriter Elizabeth Meriwether discussed her hypothesis on how Holmes was able to trick so many people. “You hear a lot of, ‘How did she get all these men on board with the company? They must have been in love with her,’ ” Meriwether said. “That’s too simplistic an answer for why everything happened.”

The miniseries seeks to delve deeper into Holmes’s motivations, not just what she did. “This is not just about showing all the points where this woman made bad choices,” Seyfried explained. “We’re investigating why we love a fall from grace, why we want to watch train wrecks.”


“The Dropout” is just one in a long line of documentaries about Silicon Valley hotshots who ended up being not so hot after all. According to THR, other “upcoming Silicon Valley downfall dramas” include Showtime’s “Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber,” Apple TV+’s WeWork expose “WeCrashed” and HBO’s exploration into the Facebook indictment, “Doomsday Machine.” 

“The Dropout” premieres March 3 on Hulu.",https://www.dailywire.com/news/amanda-seyfried-reveals-why-she-originally-said-no-to-playing-elizabeth-holmes-in-new-hulu-series-the-dropout,"TV viewers are obsessed with the idea of a con gone wrong, and one of the biggest is the story of Elizabeth Holmes.

The Daily Wire,Federal Judge Compares January 6 Riot To War In Ukraine During Sentencing Of Man Who Stole…,I,"On Friday, United States District Judge for the District of Columbia, Reggie Walton, reportedly compared the actions of January 6 rioters at the U.S. Capitol to Russian forces invading Ukraine while sentencing the man who stole Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s lectern during the breach.

Walton claimed the U.S. was on a “dangerous slide” and that the riot was what you would see in “banana republics” or “what we’re experiencing now in Ukraine.” The accused man, Adam Johnson from Florida, said he would not have tried to harm Pelosi, but rather he would have asked “for a selfie with her, if anything” had he ran into her that day.


Johnson, the man who posed for a photograph that went viral as he waltzed through the U.S. Capitol building carrying Pelosi’s stolen lectern, was sentenced to 75 days in jail for his misdemeanor, ABC News’ Tampa Bay affiliate reported:

Johnson pleaded guilty to one count of entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds and was sentenced by a federal judge in Washington, D.C. Friday. In addition to the jail sentence, Johnson was fined $5,000 and sentenced to 200 hours of community service. 

Because of time already served, Johnson only has to spend 60 more days in jail.


According to Politico, Walton opined that the U.S. could end up in a war-torn future if the government doesn’t “do anything” to stop future events like January 6:

In handing down the sentence, Judge Reggie Walton said the U.S. was headed in a dangerous direction if activities like the insurrection continue.

“That’s what we see in countries, like what we’re experiencing now in Ukraine,” Judge Walton said, according to Politico. “That’s where we’re headed if we don’t do anything to stop it.”

For his part, Johnson was apologetic and expressed his understanding that things would be very different for him had he pulled this sort of stunt in a foreign nation, NBC News reported:


Johnson, speaking to the court on Friday, said he’d been “nothing but cooperative” with the government since his arrest, and said his actions demonstrated that he was apologetic and was “ashamed” to have been a part of the Capitol riot.

Johnson said he recognized that if he did what he did in another country, he’d be “on a firing wall instead of a courtroom.” He claimed he had no intent to harm Pelosi.

Johnson is a stay-at-home father of five, and admitted in court that he stole the lectern “because he believed it would make a good prop for a picture.”

According to NBC News, “Johnson also admitted that he shouted that a bust of George Washington would be ‘a great battering ram’ as rioters attempted to break into the floor of the U.S. House, where members of Congress were still present.”


As for what the world is “experiencing now in Ukraine,” as Walton referenced, there are currently thousands of Ukrainians are fleeing the country with dozens — potentially hundreds — of Russians and Ukrainians killed so far as Russia continues its full-scale attack on the Eastern European nation.",https://www.dailywire.com/news/federal-judge-compares-january-6-riot-to-war-in-ukraine-during-sentencing-of-man-who-stole-pelosis-lectern,"On Friday, United States District Judge for the District of Columbia, Reggie Walton, reportedly compared the actions of January 6 rioters at the U.S. Capitol to Russian forces invading Ukraine while sentencing the man who stole Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s lectern during the breach.",2022-02-25
The Daily Wire,"Biden Turned Over Intelligence To China On Russia’s Plans To Invade Ukraine, China Gave It To…",I,"Democrat President Joe Biden’s administration turned over intelligence to communist China for months about Russia’s plans to invade Ukraine in an attempt to get China to convince Russia to not invade, according to a report.

“Over three months, senior Biden administration officials held half a dozen urgent meetings with top Chinese officials in which the Americans presented intelligence showing Russia’s troop buildup around Ukraine and beseeched the Chinese to tell Russia not to invade,” The New York Times reported. “Each time, the Chinese officials, including the foreign minister and the ambassador to the United States, rebuffed the Americans, saying they did not think an invasion was in the works. After one diplomatic exchange in December, U.S. officials got intelligence showing Beijing had shared the information with Moscow, telling the Russians that the United States was trying to sow discord — and that China would not try to impede Russian plans and actions.”


The report comes after Russia launched a full-scale invasion into Ukraine late this week and fighting has already reached the country’s capital city of Kyiv, although U.S. officials claim that Russia’s advance has been slowed down some by Ukrainian resistance.

The meetings in which the Biden administration turned over intelligence to Beijing started after Biden held a video summit with Chinese dictator Xi Jinping in mid-November.

The New York Times added:


After the meeting, American officials decided that the Russian troop buildup around Ukraine presented the most immediate problem that China and the United States could try to defuse together. Some officials thought the outcome of the video summit indicated there was potential for an improvement in U.S.-China relations. Others were more skeptical, but thought it was important to leave no stone unturned in efforts to prevent Russia from attacking, one official said.

Days later, White House officials met with the ambassador, Qin Gang, at the Chinese Embassy. They told the ambassador what U.S. intelligence agencies had detected: a gradual encirclement of Ukraine by Russian forces, including armored units. William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director, had flown to Moscow on Nov. 2 to confront the Russians with the same information, and on Nov. 17, American intelligence officials shared their findings with NATO.

White House officials told China about the allegedly tough sanctions that they would impose on Russia and how those sanctions could negatively impact China because of China’s close ties with Russia. They also tried to persuade China that its global image could suffer.

Their desperate attempts “went nowhere” and China’s Qin was reportedly acted “skeptical and suspicious,” according to The New York Times report.",https://www.dailywire.com/news/biden-turned-over-intelligence-to-china-on-russias-plans-to-invade-ukraine-china-gave-it-to-russia-report-says,"“Over three months, senior Biden administration officials held half a dozen urgent meetings with top Chinese officials in which the Americans presented intelligence showing Russia’s troop buildup around Ukraine and beseeched the Chinese to tell Russia not to invade,” The New York Times reported. “Each time, the Chinese officials, including the foreign minister and the ambassador to the United States, rebuffed the Americans, saying they did not think an invasion was in the works.

The Daily Wire,NATO Takes Unprecedented Action To Respond To Russia: Putin’s ‘Objectives Not Limited To…,I,"NATO activated the NATO Response Force for the first time ever on Friday in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion into Ukraine, which many critics have said is a result of weakness from Democrat President Joe Biden.

“NATO Supreme Allied Commander Gen. Tod Wolters activated the multinational force consisting of land, air, sea and special operations forces from the allies that can deploy quickly in support of the NATO alliance,” CNN reported. “The entire NATO Response Force is 40,000 troops but [NATO Secretary General Jens] Stoltenberg did not say how many would be activated.”


Stoltenberg warned during a press conference on Friday that Putin’s “objectives are not limited to Ukraine.”

German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht described Putin as acting “highly unpredictable,” worrying that he may attack NATO countries.

“We have a residual hope that he will not cross further borders,” she said. “But I have to say, honestly: that is no certainty.”



Wolters said that NATO has forces operating in the maritime, land, air, space, and cyber domains that are actively working to defend NATO’s sovereignty.


“This is an historic moment and the very first time the Alliance has employed these high readiness forces in a deterrence and defense role. They represent a flexible, combat credible force that can be employed in multiple ways and we are utilizing fully their inherent agility,” he said. “These deterrence measures are prudent and enhance our speed, responsiveness and capability to shield and protect the one billion citizens we swore to protect. We are grateful to our allies Canada and the United States for their recent commitments to deploy an additional 7,460 troops, including an armored brigade combat team, artillery units, a naval frigate, and surveillance aircraft, to support this Alliance-wide effort.”

“As NATO establishes this enhanced vigilance on the Alliance’s eastern flank, Allied military forces will posture and exercise to increase our readiness and interoperability. Your soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines stand ready to protect every meter of Allied territory,” he continued. “We admire the courage and tenacity of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and citizens in defending their country. The Alliance remains steadfast in our collective commitment to shield and protect each other. Moving forward, we are prepared to leverage the strength of all our forces to defend the Alliance.”",https://www.dailywire.com/news/nato-takes-unprecedented-action-to-respond-to-russia-putins-objectives-not-limited-to-ukraine,Stoltenberg warned during a press conference on Friday that Putin’s “objectives are not limited to Ukraine.”,2022-02-25
The Daily Wire,Heartbreaking Footage Shows Ukrainian Nurses Comforting Newborns In Makeshift Bomb Shelter Amid…,I,"Videos of injured citizens and tanks rolling into Ukraine are making the horror of Russia’s invasion palpable even for people living thousands of miles away. But a video featuring some of the most defenseless Ukrainian citizens is among the most heartbreaking footage to come out of conflict so far. The clip highlights the depth of fear and helplessness among the population.

According to The Daily Mail, the video was captured by medical staff as they helped around one dozen newborn babies settle into what appears to be a storage closet inside a makeshift bomb shelter. Prior to being relocated, the newborns were patients at Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Children’s Clinical Hospital in Dnipro, which is located in Eastern Ukraine. 


The city became a target of missile strikes shortly after Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of the neighboring country began. Premature and other vulnerable babies were among those evacuated to the basement for safety during the bombing. The NICU, which stands for Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, is where premature or ill newborn babies go for extra care ranging from feeding tubes to ventilators, which help the babies stay alive.



Footage shows NICU nurses tending to the babies with several of them rocking and comforting the newborns, who are wrapped in colorful blankets and sleeping quietly. Medical staff members are seen on video helping use inflatable bags to deliver air, with some nurses even smiling amid the danger.

“This is the NICU. In a bomb shelter. Can you imagine?” Dr. Denis Surkov, chief of the neonatal unit wrote to the New York Times in a text message. “This is our reality.” 

The babies were moved to the makeshift bomb shelter after bombing began Thursday morning as a necessary precaution.   


“We were nervous, very confused,” Dr. Surkov continued. 

Ukraine’s foreign minister criticized Russia’s aggressive invasion of Ukraine on Thursday, calling it “beyond evil” that hospitals were among the targets of the strikes.

Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter, “Consider this: Putin has launched a massive war of aggression in Europe during a still raging pandemic. On top of that, Russians bomb Ukrainian hospitals now. This is beyond evil. The only moral choice any government can make now is to support Ukraine by all means.”


The video of fragile newborns is only one of many tragic images to come out of the early days of the Russian invasion. Footage of a man saying goodbye to his daughter as she evacuated to safety moved many people to tears. 

The video shows the father bending down to hug the little girl goodbye and straighten her winter hat before breaking down into sobs. The child also cries as the two embrace one last time before she boards a bus, which is likely headed to a safer location.

There’s also a shocking video that reportedly shows a military tank running over an occupied car in Kyiv as horrified citizens look on. The driver of the car miraculously survived the incident. Unfortunately, these video clips are unlikely to be the last harrowing footage that comes out of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.",https://www.dailywire.com/news/heartbreaking-footage-shows-ukrainian-nurses-comforting-newborns-in-makeshift-bomb-shelter-amid-russian-invasion,"According to The Daily Mail, the video was captured by medical staff as they helped around one dozen newborn babies settle into what appears to be a storage closet inside a makeshift bomb shelter.

The Daily Wire,‘We’re Closer To A Really Big War Than Most Civilians Want To Face’: Historian Niall Ferguson…,I,"When they sat down over coffee for the new Daily Wire series, “The Search,” podcaster Ben Shapiro and renowned historian Niall Ferguson couldn’t have known just how timely their interview would prove to be. During a roving discussion taped in late January in Palm Beach, the pair dissected the United States’ inability to properly weigh risk when it comes to foreign policy and what that fecklessness might mean to China and Russia. 

With a now-eerie prescience, the Hoover Institute fellow tells Shapiro that, based on his knowledge of world skirmishes over the last 100 years, the Biden administration’s weakness on the international stage will undoubtedly lead Russia to launch an attack on Ukraine. “The threat of sanctions is not going to stop Putin invading Ukraine,” he says with surety. “I still think it’s quite likely that he will increase his military aggression towards Ukraine because financial sanctions are not an effective deterrent, and I don’t think they’re an effective deterrent against the Chinese, either.”



Weeks later, bombs began to fall in Kyiv. 

The West’s bizarre overreaction to the marginal danger posed by COVID-19 compared to its apathy toward the serious threats China and Russia present dominates much of the 90-minute dialogue, available to Daily Wire subscribers. “This is one of the odd things about safetyism — the cult of treating all risks as incredibly high,” Ferguson points out. “Oddly enough, it desensitizes you to the real risks. And I think the U.S. has become pathologically incapable of thinking realistically about risk.”

How this has manifested, he explains, is with federal authorities pushing to mask children and force vaccines on young people who face almost no danger from the coronavirus while blithely ignoring the fact that the world’s most powerful authoritarian regimes have suddenly begun behaving as allies. 


“We’re closer to a really big war than most civilians want to face,” he concludes.

Legacies Over Risk

The looming reality of seismic geopolitical events leads the friends to reflect on just how endemic distorted perspectives have become in America. 


Ferguson says working on his last book, “Doom: The Politics of Catastrophe,” made him realize that, while fear of a virus might have highlighted the problem, defective public choice has been around for at least 20 years. Generations ago, he explains, both the public and the federal government were better at assessing risk because they had no choice. 

“I mean, coming out of the 1930s and 40s, you confronted some very profound risks, nuclear war being the biggest,” he says. “But my sense is that the further away we got from World War II, the less good our elites have been at assessing risk and the more inclined they have been to say, ‘Why worry about probabilities? Let’s assume that everything is a huge risk. And then let’s design extraordinarily complex regulations to prevent risk.’” The unrealistic goal, he argues, appears to be to prevent death.

For Shapiro, this shallowness that views the mere preservation of life as the greatest objective also explains our current national obsession with identity, as well as the epidemic of mental health issues plaguing younger generations. He points out with a bit of gallows humor that such a value structure can’t help but breed a culture-wide sense of meaninglessness and unfulfillment. 


“Like if [assassins] get me in the Everglades, honestly, they deserve it,” he jokes about a recent vacation with his family, where it dawned on him that if his haters were to successfully gun him down (as online trolls have threatened to do over the years), he’d have to give them credit for their marksmanship. “Like if they get that shot and they nail me and I’m floating among the mangroves and alligators,” he laughs, “I’ll just have to give them credit. Like, really, that’s an excellent hit.” 

What’s clear a moment later is Shapiro’s dark amusement comes from his deep sense of mission, his conviction that his life has a greater purpose than merely preserving his heart-beat. Like the men who founded the nation, he says he cares more about building something of lasting value than in being physically safe.

“My dad used to be kind of paranoid about [me voicing my political opinions],” Shapiro reveals, “and he used to say, ‘Are you sure you want to say this about Islamists or are you sure you want to say this about the Chinese?’ Shapiro’s answer: “Yeah, I am. I mean, at a certain point, you’ve got to say what you’re going to say.” Because that’s what it takes, he argues, to build institutions that have the potential to transform a society from one in which happiness is found in the arbitrary notion of feeling personally “affirmed” to one in which meaning is derived from accomplishment.

“If the ages have taught us anything,” Shapiro says, “it’s that your happiness has very little to do with how you sit on a given day and has a lot more to do with whether you’re building things of consequence.”

Building Institutions

Though their critics often like to pretend otherwise, over the course of the discussion both Ferguson and Shapiro are clear that their hope for the future doesn’t lie solely in winning elections or “owning” libs, but in creating organizations that leave legacies for the future. 

When Ferguson reflects on the attitudes of Millennials and Gen Z today, histrionic as they are over thought-crimes and emotional offense, he admits the situation looks bleak. But he finds hope in what he calls “Generation T — kids who began to develop societal awareness during the presidency of Donald Trump. There, he already sees what he believes is a sense that “wokeness is boring and counterintuitive.” 

But he doesn’t believe their tendency to think in more levelheaded, fact-based terms than the generation just ahead of them will flourish without help. They need, he argues, new institutions dedicated to developing an active and well-organized citizenry. 

“There needs to be a strong sense of the citizens’ ability to organize outside the structures of the State,” Ferguson says. “Part of the answer is to build institutions. We have to be better organized. People who thought of themselves as conservatives or classical liberals were terribly badly organized and basically lost control of the universities. It wasn’t even that hard for the Left to take over the universities.”

It’s for this reason, that, though he’s personally an atheist, Ferguson believes so deeply in the power of religious community to breed civic responsibility. Part of the Left’s interest in destroying the influence of faith in something beyond government, he argues, is that it destroys the impulse to band together to protect individual freedoms. 

It’s also what inspired him to join Bari Weiss, Steven Pinker, Larry Summers, and other independent thinkers to found The University of Austin — a new academic institution dedicated to a “fearless pursuit of the truth.”

“I’m quite interested in this challenge of institution building,” Ferguson tells Shapiro, “You’ve done that [with The Daily Wire]. And that’s one of the things about you that I find most impressive.”

Near the end, Ferguson returns to Shapiro’s point that he’s not worried about dying so much as he’s worried about leaving such work unfinished.

“I’d like to be able to die knowing I’ve started a bunch of things,” he says. “Institutions that will keep going.”",https://www.dailywire.com/news/were-closer-to-a-really-big-war-than-most-civilians-want-to-face-historian-niall-ferguson-delivers-timely-predictions-on-ukraine-in-new-episode-of-the-search,"Weeks later, bombs began to fall in Kyiv.

MSNBC,Virginia: Say Bye To Your Power Bill If You Own A Home In....,I,"Power companies are fighting an uphill battle they are sure to lose and they’re blaming customers who are taking advantage of massive government savings programs. Specifically, they are blaming Virginia Solar Incentives that encourage homeowners to use clean energy by reducing solar power projects to $0 installations.

Until now, solar panels were less about saving money and more about environmental protection. In order to get more people to switch to clean solar energy the federal and state governments are highly incentivizing homeowners who live in specific zip codes to go solar with $1000’s of dollars in rebates and incentives that can cover 100% of the costs associated with a new solar panel installation.

When homeowners visit Energybillcruncher, many are shocked to learn that solar panels can be installed on their home with no upfront costs after rebates and solar incentives. You can find out which solar incentives are offered in your area by using your zip code. You can even use this tool to help calculate your savings by entering your utility provider and your average power bill. In many cases, customers are saving up to 50% on the cost of powering their home each year.

Solar panels are much cheaper today than they were 10 years ago, which means millions of homeowners that could not previously afford to do so are switching to solar. Virginia Homeowners that qualify for this new program no longer have to buy solar panels. With rebates being as high as they are, homeowners are able to drastically reduce their power bill without dealing with the upfront costs of installing solar panels.

Yahoo,This is true. And I framed the ... letter she wrote me': Rex,I,"Simon Rex had more to say Friday about his one-time co-star Meghan Markle and the treasured thank-you note she sent him.

The actor and former MTV VJ told The Guardian earlier this month he once rejected tabloid offers of $70,000 to lie and say that he and Meghan Markle had slept together. Word got back to Markle, and she was so grateful that she sent him her thanks, which he framed. On Friday, he commented.

""This is true,"" he wrote as he retweeted the story. ""And I framed the thank you letter she wrote me. She has very nice penmanship btw.""
The two had met when they both appeared on the same show in March 2005. It was an episode of the short-lived UPN sitcom Cuts, which aired for two seasons in 2005 and 2006. They co-starred alongside cast members including Shannon Elizabeth and Shondrella Avery. And the closest they ever got, the newspaper noted, was a platonic lunch. So, for Rex, it was a hard no, no matter how desperate he was for cash.

""I was broke as f***! I really needed the money,"" Rex said. ""But I'll be on food stamps before I do that.""

The note of gratitude that he received said simply, ""It's nice to know there are still good people."" He was such a fan that he gave it a permanent spot on the wall of his home in California's Joshua Tree area.

Cuts was one of Markle's first TV appearances. She appeared on some other projects, including 90210 and Fringe, before becoming a cast member on USA legal drama Suits, which debuted in 2011. Markle left the series in 2018, weeks before marrying Prince Harry.

The Daily Wire,Twitter Locks Out Babylon Bee Over Rachel Levine Tweet; The Bee Responds: ‘Truth Is Not Hate…,I,"On Sunday, Babylon Bee CEO Seth Dillon revealed that his company, known for its satirical takes on politics and culture, has been locked out of its Twitter account for “hateful conduct.”

“I just received this notice that we’ve been locked out of our account for ‘hateful conduct,’” Dillion tweeted Sunday afternoon.

Twitter’s action came over The Babylon Bee’s piece from five days ago, jokingly naming Health and Human Services (HHS) Assistant Secretary Rachel Levine as “Man of the Year.”

Levine, a biological man, is best known for coming out as a transgender female before being appointed by President Joe Biden to the role of assistant secretary for the HHS. Recently, Levine was named one of USA Today’s “Women of the Year.”

Twitter flagged the Bee’s post poking fun at Levine’s transition and name change for violating its rules against “hateful conduct.” The rule states, “You may not promote violence against, threaten, or harass other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease.”

Dillon wrote that Twitter told the Bee that the account could be restored 12 hours after the company deletes the tweet linking to the article on Levine. Dillon told his followers that they don’t plan on deleting the tweet. “We’re not deleting anything. Truth is not hate speech. If the cost of telling the truth is the loss of our Twitter account, then so be it,” he wrote.

— Seth Dillon (@SethDillon) March 20, 2022

On Saturday, The Daily Wire reported that Twitter took action against a tweet from Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who, like The Babylon Bee, referred to Levine as a man. On Thursday, Paxton posted a screenshot of the USA Today article naming Levine as one of its “Women of the Year” and commented, “Rachel Levine is a man.” Twitter flagged the tweet as being hateful, but allowed it to remain, stating, “This tweet violated the Twitter Rules about hateful conduct. However, Twitter has determined that it may be in the public’s interest for the tweet to remain accessible.”

Paxton followed Twitter’s flagging by releasing a statement on Big Tech censorship Friday. He wrote:

Yesterday I stated an irrefutable scientific fact: Rachel Levine is a man. I pointed this out after USA Today named him a “Woman” of the Year. But Levine is not a woman. He has one X and one Y chromosome and other male-sex characteristics. I just follow the science.

For simply saying this matter-of-factly, Twitter blocked it as “hateful.” Users can now only access my statement through a trigger-warning filter. And even then, users can neither like it nor comment on it. At the same time, hundreds of other verified accounts saying the exact same thing remain untouched and unfiltered.

This whole insane episode represents a two-pronged attack from the left — both of which I’m vigorously fighting against. First is the left’s war against human biology, and especially against women. Second is their weaponization of Big Tech against conservative voices.

But Big Tech is not only anti-conservative and anti-Republican. It is now apparently anti-truth and anti-science. I will continue to use all my power to hold them accountable. Even now, I’m exploring legal options to stop their one-sided censorship.

The Daily Wire,"‘Eat Lentils, Poors!’ Left And Right Slam Bloomberg Article Telling Americans Making Less Than…",I,"Twitter users across the political spectrum excoriated Bloomberg News for an opinion column suggesting low income Americans find ways to lower their costs to deal with skyrocketing inflation.

The column, titled “Inflation Stings Most If You Earn Less Than $300K. Here’s How to Deal,” was written by Teresa Ghilarducci, a professor of economics at the New School for Social Research, a private university in New York. In it, she explains that inflation, especially soaring gas prices, will do much less harm to Americans who earn more than $289,000 per year. For those near the median income of around $50,000, or less, decisions will be much harder, Ghilarducci wrote.

“If your income is more than $289,000 a year, the run-up in gas prices may be alarming — but it’s unlikely to hammer your overall finances,” Ghilarducci wrote. “For those earning much less, it’s a different story.”

“I expect those most affected will adjust to inflation in the classic way by shifting away from relatively expensive items toward close substitutes,” she continued. “Here are some ideas on how to reconfigure consumption and lessen the blow. But again, adjustment is hard for people without savings or choices.”

Ghilarducci’s suggestions included:

taking public transportation instead of driving;
buying and eating meat subsitutes like lentils and vegetables;
avoiding buying items in bulk;
avoiding unnecessary charges; and
avoiding medical expenses for pets
Bloomberg tweeted a link to the article Saturday. “Inflation stings most if you earn less than $300K,” the tweet read. “Here’s how to deal:

Take the bus
Don’t buy in bulk
Try lentils instead of meat
Nobody said this would be fun

Twitter users from both Left and Right reacted swiftly and scathingly to the out-of-touch headline, clobbering the outlet for its condescending tone, particularly the line, “nobody said this would be fun.”

“So for basically everyone lol,” CBS News White House Reporter Kathryn Watson tweeted in reply.

“The median annual salary in the US is $35K!” Economics professor and Brookings Institution Nonresident Senior Fellow Shamika Ravi tweeted, citing statistics from the Federal Reserve Economic Data. “Inflation is record high (40 year high of 7.5%),” she added. “Coping suggestions will get more and more ludicrous…”

“Inflation stings most if you’re in the bottom 99% of earners,” University of Denver political scientist Seth Masket noted.

“The Liberal Establishment Guide To Handling Inflation: ‘Eat lentils, poors!’” wrote Michael Knowles, host of “The Michael Knowles Show” at The Daily Wire.

“Crazy that one of the suggestions isn’t to stop paying subscriptions to out of touch, dusty media outlets,” tweeted “American Dad” screenwriter Soren Bowie.

“Good news. According to Bloomberg, you can avoid all the disastrous policies of the Biden White House for just a mere $300k a year!” said Texas Republican Congressional Candidate Wesley Hunt. “Can you say, tone deaf?”

“Tips to cope with inflation if you’re poor: – suck it up, buttercup,” replied left-wing activist Emily Gorcenski.

The Daily Wire,‘Impossible To Rewrite The Terrible History Of The Holocaust’: Zelensky Slammed By Israeli…,I,"On Sunday, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky sparked outrage when he compared the Russian invasion of Ukraine to the Holocaust during a speech to the Israeli government.

“This Russian invasion of Ukraine is not just a military operation, as Moscow claims. This is a large-scale and treacherous war aimed at destroying our people. Destroying our children, our families. Our state. Our cities. Our communities. Our culture. And everything that makes Ukrainians Ukrainians. Everything that Russian troops are now destroying. Deliberately. In front of the whole world,” Zelensky said. “That is why I have the right to this parallel and to this comparison. Our history and your history. Our war for our survival and World War II.”

“Listen to what the Kremlin says. Just listen! There are even terms that sounded then. And this is a tragedy. When the Nazi party raided Europe and wanted to destroy everything. Destroy everyone. Wanted to conquer the nations. And leave nothing from us, nothing from you. Even the name and the trace. They called it ‘the final solution to the Jewish issue.’ You remember that. And I’m sure you will never forget!” Zelensky added. “But listen to what is sounding now in Moscow. Hear how these words are said again: ‘Final solution.’ But already in relation, so to speak, to us, to the ‘Ukrainian issue.’”

“I appreciate the President of Ukraine and support the Ukrainian people in heart and deed, but it is impossible to rewrite the terrible history of the Holocaust,” Israel’s Communications Minister Yoaz Hendel tweeted. “Genocide was also committed on Ukrainian soil. The war is terrible, but the comparison to the horrors of the Holocaust and the final solution is outrageous.”

“If Zelensky’s speech was given… in normal [non-war] times, we would have said it bordered on Holocaust denial… Every comparison between a regular war, as difficult as it may be, and the extermination of millions of Jews in gas chambers in the framework of the Final Solution, is a total distortion of history. The same is true for the claim that Ukrainians helped Jews in the Holocaust… The historic truth is that the Ukrainian people cannot be proud of its behavior in the Holocaust of the Jews,” Yuval Steinitz, a Likud MK, said. “None of that changes the fact that despite the outrageous use of the Holocaust, we must continue humanitarian aid to the citizens of Ukraine suffering from the war and pray for its end to come soon.”

“I don’t understand Ukrainian, but if the translation I heard is accurate, Zelensky asked us to treat the Ukrainians like they treated us 80 years ago. I’m sorry, but I think we will have to reject that request. We are, after all, a moral nation,” said Simcha Rothman, a Religious Zionist MK, on the subject of Zelensky’s reference to Ukrainians who saved Jews during the Holocaust.

“It is sounded openly. This is a tragedy. Once again, it was said at a meeting in Moscow. It is available on official websites. This was quoted in the state media of Russia. Moscow says so: without the war against us, they would not be able to ensure a ‘final solution’ allegedly for their own security. Just like it was said 80 years ago,” Zelensky said later in his speech, before urging Israel to share its Iron Dome technology.

“Everyone in Israel knows that your missile defense is the best. It is powerful. Everyone knows that your weapon is strong. Everyone knows you’re doing great. You know how to defend your state interests, the interests of your people. And you can definitely help us protect our lives, the lives of Ukrainians, the lives of Ukrainian Jews,” Zelensky said. “One can keep asking why we can’t get weapons from you. Or why Israel has not imposed strong sanctions against Russia. Why it doesn’t put pressure on Russian business. But it is up to you, dear brothers and sisters, to choose the answer. And you will have to live with this answer, people of Israel.”

“Ukrainians have made their choice. 80 years ago. They rescued Jews. That is why the Righteous Among the Nations are among us,” Zelensky concluded. “People of Israel, now you have such a choice.”",https://www.dailywire.com/news/impossible-to-rewrite-the-terrible-history-of-the-holocaust-zelensky-slammed-by-israeli-lawmakers-for-comparing-russian-invasion-to-final-solution,"On Sunday, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky sparked outrage when he compared the Russian invasion of Ukraine to the Holocaust during a speech to the Israeli government.",2022-03-20
The Daily Wire,Military Convoy Carrying Up To 6 Nuclear Warheads Spotted On Move In Europe As Ukraine War…,I,"A military convoy carrying up to six nuclear warheads was spotted late last week moving through Scotland, which comes as war between Russia and Ukraine rages on and Russian President Vladimir Putin has put his nuclear forces on high alert following his invasion.

“The convoy was carrying up to six nuclear warheads only a mile south of Glasgow city centre, heading to Royal Naval Armaments Depot Coulport on Loch Long, according to NukeWatch, an organization that tracks and monitors the convoys that transport the UK’s Trident nuclear warheads,” the Daily Mail reported. “The nuclear-armed convoy passed over Erskine Bridge, heading up along the M6 motorway near Kendal, before being spotted on the M74 at Lesmahagow and arriving in Loch Long at approximately 11:30pm on Saturday.”

“I think there were four warhead carriers I believe. Our reckoning is that each of those trucks can carry two but one of the trucks is empty as a spare in case [sic] breaks down,” Nukewatch UK Campaigner Jane Tallents told a local publication. “So if there’s four we expect there to be six warheads, or up to six warheads anyway.”

The organization claimed that the most likely reason that the warheads were transferred was for maintenance purposes, and not to prepare for their use in battle.

“I don’t think this convoy is of any more concern than the fact that we are always, 24/7, armed and ready to start a nuclear war,” Tallents said. “All the things that some of us have worried about constantly since the 60s, they come to pass really. People have forgotten about it but they are there.”

The move comes as the war in Ukraine has nearly reached the one-month mark since Russian forces invaded.

Shortly after Putin invaded Ukraine, he ordered the country’s nuclear forces be put on high alert.

“Citing ‘aggressive statements’ by NATO and tough financial sanctions, Putin issued a directive to increase the readiness of Russia’s nuclear weapons, raising fears that the invasion of Ukraine could lead to nuclear war, whether by design or mistake,” the Associated Press reported. “The Russian leader is ‘potentially putting in play forces that, if there’s a miscalculation, could make things much, much more dangerous,’ said a senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss rapidly unfolding military operations.”

U.S. officials now warn that Putin may brandish nuclear threats as the war is not going in his favor with Ukrainian forces grinding the Russian military’s advances to a halt.

“Protracted occupation of parts of Ukrainian territory threatens to sap Russian military manpower and reduce their modernized weapons arsenal, while consequent economic sanctions will probably throw Russia into prolonged economic depression and diplomatic isolation,” Lieutenant General Scott Berrier, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said in a report. “As this war and its consequences slowly weaken Russian conventional strength. Russia likely will increasingly rely on its nuclear deterrent to signal the West and project strength to its internal and external audiences.”",https://www.dailywire.com/news/military-convoy-carrying-up-to-6-nuclear-warheads-spotted-on-move-in-europe-as-ukraine-war-rages-on-report,"A military convoy carrying up to six nuclear warheads was spotted late last week moving through Scotland, which comes as war between Russia and Ukraine rages on and Russian President Vladimir Putin has put his nuclear forces on high alert following his invasion.",2022-03-20
The Daily Wire,‘That Final Spot Was Taken From Me Because Of The NCAA’s Decision’: Swimmer Unleashes On NCAA…,I,"After days of silence from most female athletes at the NCAA Women’s Swimming Championships, a young woman whose finals spot was stolen from her by a biologically male swimmer is speaking out.

“My name is Reka Gyorgy from Hungary. I am a 2016 Rio Olympian, represented Virginia Tech for the past 5 years, a 2 time ACC champion, 2 time All-American and 3 time honorable mention All-American,” wrote Virginia Tech swimmer Reka Gyorgy in a letter to the NCAA that she posted on Instagram.

“With all due respect, I would like to address something that is a problem in our sport right now and hurting athletes, especially swimmers,” wrote Gyorgy. “Everyone has heard and known about transgender [swimmer], Lia Thomas, and her case including all the issues and concerns that her situation brought into our sport.”

Gyorgy wrote that she respects and fully stands with Thomas and is convinced that Thomas is “no different” than Gyorgy herself or any other Division 1 swimmer who has worked hard their entire swimming career.

“She is doing what she is passionate about and deserves that right,” wrote Gyorgy. “On the other hand, I would like to critique the NCAA rules that allow her to compete against us, who are biologically women.”

“I’m writing this letter right now in hopes that the NCAA will open their eyes and change these rules in the future. It doesn’t promote our sport in a good way and I think it is disrespectful against the biologically female swimmers who are competing in the NCAA.”

Gyorgy said that she swam the 500 free at the NCAA’s on Thursday where she placed 17th — meaning that she did not make it back to the finals and was a first alternate.

“I’m a 5th year senior, I have been top 16 and top 8 before and I know how much of a privilege it is to make finals at a meet this big,” she said. “This is my last college meet ever and I feel frustrated. It feels like that final spot was taken away from me because of the NCAA’s decision to let someone who is not a biological female compete.”

“I know you could say I had the opportunity to swim faster and make the top 16, but this situation makes it a bit different and I can’t help but be angry or sad. It hurts me, my ear and other women in the pool. One spot was taken away from the girl who got 9th in the 500 free and didn’t make it back to the A final preventing her from being an All-American. Every event that transgender athletes competed in was one spot taken away from biological females throughout the meet.”

Gyorgy wrote that the “NCAA knew what was coming this past week. They knew opinions and minds will be divided and chose to do nothing.”

“This week has been more about reporters, media and division in our sport than things like two women going under 21 seconds in the 50 freestyle, 3 women going under 50 seconds in the 100 butterfly and the first woman IN HISTORY to go under 48 seconds in the 100 backstroke,” she added.

“Thursday was not a specific athlete’s fault. It is the result of the NCAA and their lack of interest in protecting their athletes,” she continued.

“I ask that the NCAA takes time to think about all the other biological women in swimming, try to think how they would feel if they would be in our shoes,” she said. “Make the right changes for our sport and for a better future in swimming.”

The NCAA did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Daily Wire.",https://www.dailywire.com/news/that-final-spot-was-taken-from-me-because-of-the-ncaas-decision-swimmer-unleashes-on-ncaa-for-allowing-a-biological-male-in-her-race,"After days of silence from most female athletes at the NCAA Women’s Swimming Championships, a young woman whose finals spot was stolen from her by a biologically male swimmer is speaking out.

The Daily Wire,MSNBC Guest Says The Hardest Part Of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s Hearings Will Be Not…,I,"MSNBC guest Elie Mystal, who also serves as justice correspondent at The Nation, said on Saturday that the hardest part of Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson’s hearings — for her — would likely be refraining from punching Republicans in the mouth.

Mystal joined host Tiffany Cross on “The Cross Connection,” where he argued that Jackson’s credentials were impeccable and the only things any Republicans had against her were “racism and disgusting innuendo.”

As Mediaite reported, Cross began the segment by asking Mystal what he expected to come out of the hearings, scheduled to start Monday — and she suggested that what Republicans were angling for was a “viral moment” that they could use to smear Judge Jackson in the court of public opinion.

“I’m curious, Elie, what do you anticipate to come out of these hearings? Because you know, they’re going to be vying for a viral moment on the Republican side,” Cross said. “And what would you say is the biggest challenge to Judge Jackson’s confirmation, if any, given that Democrats have the majority?”

“The biggest challenge is her not getting out of her chair and punching one of these fools in the mouth,” Mystal said of the Republicans who were likely to challenge her. “Like, that’s the hardest thing, because all they have for her right now is racism and disgusting innuendo. Like, they don’t have… They don’t have anything on her record.”

Mystal went on to note that Judge Jackson had been on the court for nine years, arguing that Republicans were not contesting her decisions in “hundreds and hundreds of cases” and were not making “substantive legal arguments about her actual decision-making process.”

“All they’ve got is the racism, they want to know about the LSAT scores. Some of them are going to call her an affirmative action nominee,” Mystal continued, referencing criticisms directed primarily at President Joe Biden for his outright statement that he was going to choose a black woman, to the exclusion of all other demographics. “Some of them are going to ask her why she’s not sad that good white people weren’t considered for the job. That’s literally what they have.”

Mystal then pivoted to address Senator Josh Hawley, who raised questions earlier in the week about Jackson’s record in dealing with child pornography and sex offender cases.

“But like, that’s, the challenge will just be keeping her cool because if she keeps her cool, which I’m sure she will do,” Mystal concluded. “We’re talking about a high school debate champion and, you know, a person who has prepared her whole life for these four days. As long as she keeps her cool, she should do fine because she’s so eminently qualified and impeccably credentialed that they don’t really have anything on her.”

The White House has responded to Hawley’s accusations, saying, that they amounted to “toxic and weakly-presented misinformation that relies on taking cherry-picked elements of her record out of context.”",https://www.dailywire.com/news/msnbc-guest-says-the-hardest-part-of-judge-ketanji-brown-jacksons-hearings-will-be-not-punching-republicans,"MSNBC guest Elie Mystal, who also serves as justice correspondent at The Nation, said on Saturday that the hardest part of Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson’s hearings — for her — would likely be refraining from punching Republicans in the mouth.",2022-03-20
The Daily Wire,‘I Challenged Myself To Push It Further’: Abortion Activist Rihanna On Her ‘Rebellious’…,I,"Abortion activist Rihanna reflected on what she’s called her “rebellious” maternity style and admitted she’s basically “challenged” herself to “push it further” than others had before.

The 34-year-old singer, a President Joe Biden supporter, has done the opposite of what most women do during pregnancy. Instead of the singer wearing outfits that consist of baggy clothes and looks that cover up her belly, she’s worn tops that show off her baby bump, even accessorizing it.

During a recent press event at an ULTA beauty store in Los Angeles, the “Umbrella” hitmaker showed up wearing a metallic silver cropped top with a low-rise sparkling skirt. She completed the look with her hair up in a ponytail and a silver belly chain.

“It’s been me personally saying, I’m not going to buy maternity clothes,” the superstar singer shared, reported Bustle in a recent piece. “I’m not gonna buy maternity pants, jeans, dresses, or [do] whatever society told me to do before.”

“When I saw women dress during their pregnancy [in the past], I’d think that that was the only way,” she added, noting she called her style “rebellious.” “So, I challenged myself to push it further and really just have fun with [maternity style]. Because there’s nothing more fun than a challenge for me.”

“Like that’s where I get creative,” the “Diamonds” hitmaker continued. “That’s where I’m forced to come up with new ideas and new ways to make it work.”

Rihanna’s social media account is filled with numerous examples of these strange maternity looks that can be seen here, posted since she revealed in January she was expecting her first child with rapper boyfriend A$AP Rocky, reported People magazine.

The outfits range from a black lace-up top and low-cut pants in one shot to a teal blue one-shoulder body suit — complete with a cutout that showed off her bump. Other looks even included a mini skirt, bikini top, leather jacket and thigh-high boots. To say the looks were daring would be a serious understatement.

The singer, born Robyn Rihanna Fenty, admitted she’s enjoyed the boost of creativity and said she didn’t “want it to end.” She has also spoken about how proud she is to be creating a life — despite her years of support for abortion access.

“There’s going to be the other side of pregnancy, which is like your ‘snap back’ body, and that’s going to be a challenge in and of itself,” Fenty explained. “So I’m looking forward to being creative in that [stage] as well.”

The “We Found Love” hitmaker’s been praised for her unique maternity looks by such stars as Kim Kardashian, Victoria’s Secret models and more.

News. “@Badgalriri best pregnancy style ever.”",https://www.dailywire.com/news/i-challenged-myself-to-push-it-further-abortion-activist-rihanna-on-her-rebellious-pregnancy-outfits,"Abortion activist Rihanna reflected on what she’s called her “rebellious” maternity style and admitted she’s basically “challenged” herself to “push it further” than others had before.",2022-03-20
The Daily Wire,Biden Admin DOJ ‘Looking Under Every Stone’ Regarding Federal Crimes In Breonna Taylor Case:…,I,"The Biden administration’s Justice Department remains committed to looking at “every possible civil rights violation that could have happened that led to the death of Breonna Taylor,” more than two years after the controversial shooting, according to famed attorney Ben Crump.

Crump and Taylor’s mother, Tamika Palmer, met with representatives of the Department of Justice on Monday, more than 700 days after Taylor died in crossfire between police officers and Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker. “They affirm that they are looking under every stone” for possible rights violations in the case.

Rumors swirled after the March 2020 shootout, which took place as members of the Louisville Metro Police Department served a warrant at Taylor’s apartment due to her alleged connection to a suspected drug dealer. Many of those tales were spread by Crump, according to one of the officers involved in the raid, retired LMPD Sgt. John Mattingly.

Crump fits the model of a “grimy defense attorney,” who “seems to sniff out the national stories that can make him a buck, get some screen time, and gain him more notoriety,” Mattingly writes in his new book, “12 Seconds In The Dark: A Police Officer’s Firsthand Account of the Breonna Taylor Raid.” He “gets on TV like a televangelist and piggybacks the tragedies these families are going through.” Mattingly says the Taylor case was no exception. “Crump made his usual rounds on national television making false and slanderous allegations about the events of March 13 and the officers involved.”

He started the false narrative that Breonna Taylor was asleep in her bed when she was killed. He said we didn’t knock or announce and in fact he claimed we changed our story from no-knock to knock and announce to fit our narrative. He claimed they called 911 as we were busting the door down, which is an absolute lie. … He said we were in plain clothes, which is true, but it’s misguided because he leaves out the fact we were clearly identified as POLICE with raid vests. Crump claimed we were at the wrong house and the suspect we were looking for was already in custody: 100 percent lies.

“Crump is very good at tying tragedies and injustices together to skew the narrative and hype up a crowd,” Mattingly concluded.

Walker shot Mattingly in the leg as he opened the door. Mattingly sets the record straight in his book, as well as in an exclusive interview with this author for The Daily Wire.

Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron similarly blasted Crump’s sensationalist manner after the grand jury dismissed charges against every police officer involved in the shooting, except wanton endangerment charges against Brett Hankinson, on September 23, 2020.

“This is the Ben Crump model,” Cameron said. “He goes into a city, creates a narrative, cherry-picks facts to establish, to prove that narrative, creates chaos in a community, misrepresents the facts, and then he leaves with his money, and then asks the community to pick up the pieces. It is terribly offensive on his part to push such narratives, such falsehoods.”

A jury of his peers found Hankinson not guilty of wanton endangerment earlier this month, returning a verdict in just three hours. Hankinson testified that when he heard gunshots fired in the apartment, he believed Walker was executing his fellow officers.

But Crump says he has found a receptive audience in the Biden administration. “We got an affirmation that the Department of Justice is not swayed with what happens with state charges,” Crump told the media.

At a joint press conference, Tamika Palmer said, “The most important thing is to remember that Breonna didn’t deserve this.” Mattingly, who expresses deep compassion for Taylor’s family in his book, agrees that Taylor did not deserve her fate, but he blames her boyfriend, Walker, for opening fire unprovoked, then leaving his girlfriend alone as police returned fire while he dove into an adjacent bedroom like a “coward.”",https://www.dailywire.com/news/biden-admin-doj-looking-under-every-stone-regarding-federal-crimes-in-breonna-taylor-case-crump,"The Biden administration’s Justice Department remains committed to looking at “every possible civil rights violation that could have happened that led to the death of Breonna Taylor,” more than two years after the controversial shooting, according to famed attorney Ben Crump.","Mar 19, 2022"
The Daily Wire,Extremists Who Biden Removed From Official Terrorist List Launch Attacks Against Saudi Arabia:…,I,"A group of Iranian-backed extremists that Democrat President Joe Biden removed from the official Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) list reportedly launched attacks against Saudi Arabia over the weekend.

“The Saudi-led coalition said early on Sunday that the Iran-aligned Houthi group launched four attacks on the kingdom that damaged civilian cars and homes but caused no casualties,” Reuters reported. “Saudi state news agency (SPA) said one attack targeted a water desalination plant in the city of Al-Shaqeeq, an Aramco facility in Jizan, a power station in the southern Dhahran al Janub city, and a gas facility in Khamis Mushait.”


The Saudi-led coalition said that the latest attack included the use of ballistic missiles, drones, and cruise missiles. They said that they were monitoring enemy drone activity and had shot down a ballistic missile that targeted civilians.



The Trump administration designated the Houthis, also known as Ansarallah, as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) and a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) under the leadership of former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The Biden administration quickly reversed the terrorist designation after taking over in early 2021.

The Council on Foreign Relations noted:

The main defense of the Trump administration decision to call the Houthis terrorists is that they repeatedly commit acts of terrorism. QED. And the main critique of the Biden administration’s revocation of that decision is equally simple: the Houthis have long committed, and continue to commit, acts of terror. They should be designated an FTO because they are an FTO.


“These designations will provide additional tools to confront terrorist activity and terrorism by Ansarallah, a deadly Iran-backed militia group in the Gulf region,” Pompeo said in a statement at the time. “The designations are intended to hold Ansarallah accountable for its terrorist acts, including cross-border attacks threatening civilian populations, infrastructure, and commercial shipping.”

Pompeo had said that if the Houthis did not behave like a terrorist organization, they would not be designated as a terrorist organization.

The statement added:


We need not look further than the callous attack targeting the civilian airport in Aden on December 30, in which the Houthis struck the arrival terminal killing 27 individuals, including three staff members of the International Committee of the Red Cross, to see the destruction the Houthis continue to inflict upon civilians and civilian infrastructure. The Yemeni and Saudi governments as well as multiple experts have directly tied this attack to Ansarallah. …

It has led a brutal campaign that has killed many people, continues to destabilize the region, and denies Yemenis a peaceful solution to the conflict in their country. Rather than distance itself from the Iranian regime, it has embraced the world’s leading state-sponsor of terrorism even more. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has supplied Ansarallah with missiles, drones, and training, allowing the group to target airports and other critical infrastructure.

Not only did Biden lift the terrorist designation on the Yemeni Houthis, he also announced in 2021 that the U.S. would no longer support Saudi Arabia’s war against the terrorists.",https://www.dailywire.com/news/extremists-who-biden-removed-from-official-terrorist-list-launch-attacks-against-saudi-arabia-report,"A group of Iranian-backed extremists that Democrat President Joe Biden removed from the official Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) list reportedly launched attacks against Saudi Arabia over the weekend.

The Daily Wire,"Marked By Simmering Resentment Over Biologically Male Trans Swimmer, NCAA Women’s Swimming…",I,"ATLANTA — The NCAA Women’s Swimming Championship wrapped up Saturday evening, accentuated by rumblings in the deep over fairness in women’s sports and the inclusion of a biologically male swimmer in female races.

University of Pennsylvania swimmer Lia Thomas competed Saturday evening in the 100 freestyle final, finishing in 8th place with a time of 48.18 seconds.

The transgender athlete, who won the 500 freestyle on Thursday evening and tied for fifth in the 200 freestyle Friday evening, has drawn nationwide backlash by swimming and competing on a women’s team after racing with men for three years.

Tension was palpable in the stands as Thomas was announced the winner of the 500 freestyle  — and when Thomas was introduced ahead of the 200 freestyle.

Some in the crowd booed, some clapped, some cheered, some yelled angrily. Activists from “Save Women’s Sports” hung a banner protesting Thomas from the railings in the stands.


When attendees clapped and cheered for Thomas at Saturday morning’s preliminary races, the athlete turned a smiling face up to the crowd and briefly waved.

“It means the world to be here … I try to ignore it as much as I can,” Thomas told ESPN after winning the 500 freestyle. “I try to focus on my swimming, what I need to do to get ready for my races. And just try to block out everything else.”

Thomas declined to attend the Thursday evening post-race press conference, according to ESPN, where the transgender swimmer would likely have been pressed about backlash to a biological male in women’s sports.

Thomas’ presence was noticeable on the pool deck — aside from the fact that Thomas stands taller than many of the swimmers, the athlete also is broad shouldered and clearly has male anatomy.

Three-time Olympic gold medalist Rowdy Gaines, now an ESPN analyst broadcasting at the NCAAs, confirmed to The Daily Wire on Friday afternoon that the collegiate swimming world is “overwhelmingly” concerned about fairness in women’s sports.

“I’m finding there’s a lot of terms that come up that, terms like the fairness issue and not a level playing field, hopeless, helpless feeling,” he said, adding that some people he has spoken with have articulated that they feel it is “a sad day for the sport.”

Multiple parents with whom The Daily Wire spoke confirmed this sentiment, describing anxious mothers, fathers, coaches, and swimmers who fear publicly discussing the subject lest they face societal repercussions in a quick-to-cancel culture.

The female athletes themselves were hesitant or unwilling to share how they felt with The Daily Wire. Many of them said they were not supposed to talk to media during the championships.


“I just don’t think it’s fair,” said the father of a swimmer from Virginia. “These young ladies have worked too hard to be treated like that.”

The Virginia dad said that it has been “incredibly obvious” from where he has been sitting in the stands that parents “don’t appear to be supportive of Lia Thomas.”

“It happened several times yesterday when he finished, when he touched the wall and finished,” the father explained. “Nobody clapped, really. When the second place person came in, the place exploded.”

Felipe Delgado, the father of a sophomore swimmer competing at the championships against Lia Thomas, indicated that the NCAA is to blame for failing to establish proper parameters.

“Had they established rules that prohibited [Thomas] from being here, she wouldn’t be here,” Delgado said in a Friday evening interview.

“I am a believer that there is a gatekeeper,” he said. “And when that gatekeeper allows somebody to come in who potentially shouldn’t be invited to the party, I think ultimately the brunt of the blame, if there is blame to be had, would fall on that person.”

The Daily Wire,Systems Elon Musk Sent To Ukraine Giving Them ‘Edge In Winning’ Key Aspect Of War Against…,I,"The Starlink terminals that SpaceX founder Elon Musk sent to Ukraine have reportedly given them an advantage in winning the drone war against the invading Russian military.

“Aerorozvidka (Aerial Reconnaissance) is being used to attack Russian drones and target Vladmir Putin’s army of tanks and track down their positions in the conflict, which has been ongoing since February 24,” the Daily Mail reported. “Drones used in the field are able to use the newly available Starlink to keep connected and provide intelligence as internet and power outages plague Ukraine. With the technology, the drones can be directed to drop anti-tank munitions to help ward off the Russian attack.”

Musk said earlier this month that SpaceX’s Starlink satellite broadband service was now available in Ukraine with more terminals en route to the country, a remark that came in response to a request on Twitter from Mykhailo Fedorov, the Vice Prime Minister of Ukraine, who tweeted: “@elonmusk, while you try to colonize Mars — Russia try to occupy Ukraine! While your rockets successfully land from space — Russian rockets attack Ukrainian civil people! We ask you to provide Ukraine with Starlink stations and to address sane Russians to stand.”

“Starlink service is now active in Ukraine,” Musk responded. “More terminals en route.”

“Starlink provides high-speed, low-latency broadband internet across the globe. Within each coverage area, orders are fulfilled on a first-come, first-served basis,” the company says. “Using advanced satellites in a low orbit, Starlink enables video calls, online gaming, streaming, and other high data rate activities that historically have not been possible with satellite internet.”


“Starlink is ideally suited for areas where connectivity has been unreliable or completely unavailable,” the company added. “People across the globe are using Starlink to gain access to education, health services and even communications support during natural disasters.”

Musk later issued a warning that those using SpaceX’s Starlink terminals in Ukraine were at a high risk of being targeted by the Russians because those are some of the only remaining systems on the ground that work.

“Important warning: Starlink is the only non-Russian communications system still working in some parts of Ukraine, so probability of being targeted is high,” Musk tweeted. “Please use with caution.”


When later asked about how users should use the system with caution, Musk responded, “Turn on Starlink only when needed and place antenna away as far away from people as possible.”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky later praised Musk in a tweet, writing: “Talked to @elonmusk. I’m grateful to him for supporting Ukraine with words and deeds. Next week we will receive another batch of Starlink systems for destroyed cities. Discussed possible space projects. But I’ll talk about this after the war.”",https://www.dailywire.com/news/systems-elon-musk-sent-to-ukraine-giving-them-edge-in-winning-key-aspect-of-war-against-russia-report,The Starlink terminals that SpaceX founder Elon Musk sent to Ukraine have reportedly given them an advantage in winning the drone war against the invading Russian military.,2022-03-19
The Daily Wire,Texas AG Flagged On Twitter For ‘Hateful Conduct’ After Calling Biologically Male Rachel Levine…,I,"Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, pointed out on Twitter that “Rachel Levine is a man” — and was subsequently flagged for “hateful conduct” by the social media giant.

Earlier this week, USA Today chose Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services Rachel Levine — a biological man who claims transgender identity — as one of its “Women of the Year.” According to the outlet, the Biden appointee is among the “strong and resilient women who have been champions of change and courage, often quietly, but with powerful results.”


Paxton screenshotted USA Today’s story and tweeted simply that “Rachel Levine is a man.” Twitter flagged the tweet, stating that it “violated the Twitter Rules about hateful conduct.” However, the tweet was not removed because Twitter “determined that it may be in the public’s interest for the Tweet to remain accessible.”


Paxton later released a statement doubling down on his original message.


“Yesterday I stated an irrefutable scientific fact: Rachel Levine is a man,” Paxton wrote. “I pointed this out after USA Today named him a ‘Woman’ of the Year. But Levine is not a woman. He has one X and one Y chromosome and other male-sex characteristics. I just follow the science.”

“For simply saying this matter-of-factly, Twitter blocked it as ‘hateful.’ Users can now only access my statement through a trigger-warning filter. And even then, users can neither like it nor comment on it,” he continued. “At the same time, hundreds of other verified accounts saying the exact same thing remain untouched and unfiltered.”

“This whole insane episode represents a two-pronged attack from the left — both of which I’m vigorously fighting against. First is the left’s war against human biology, and especially against women. Second is their weaponization of Big Tech against conservative voices,” Paxton added.


“But Big Tech is not only anti-conservative and anti-Republican. It is now apparently anti-truth and anti-science. I will continue to use all my power to hold them accountable. Even now, I’m exploring legal options to stop their one-sided censorship.”


Paxton, however, is not the first Republican lawmaker to be censored by Twitter for making note of Levine’s biology. Twitter locked the account of Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN) last year after he said that “the title of first female four-star officer gets taken by a man,” referring to Levine’s nomination as a four-star admiral of the U.S. Public Health Services Commissioned Corps.


“Calling someone that was born and lived as a man for 54 years the first ‘female’ four-star officer is an insult to every little girl who dreams of breaking glass ceilings one day,” Banks also tweeted last year.

Criticism of USA Today for snubbing women in favor of Levine occurs as Lia Thomas — a biological man on the University of Pennsylvania swim team who likewise claims transgender identity — placed first in the NCAA Women’s Swimming Championship 500 yard freestyle on Thursday. In response, many honored University of Virginia swimmer Emma Weyant, who placed second, as the true winner.",https://www.dailywire.com/news/texas-ag-flagged-on-twitter-for-hateful-conduct-after-calling-biologically-male-rachel-levine-a-man,"Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, pointed out on Twitter that “Rachel Levine is a man” — and was subsequently flagged for “hateful conduct” by the social media giant.",2022-03-19
The Daily Wire,EXCLUSIVE: 3x Olympic Gold Medalist Says Swimming World Overwhelmingly Concerned About Fairness…,I,"The collegiate swimming world is “overwhelmingly” concerned about fairness in women’s sports, three-time Olympic gold medalist Rowdy Gaines said Friday.

Gaines discussed controversy surrounding transgender swimmer Lia Thomas and biological men in women’s sports during an interview with The Daily Wire at the NCAA Women’s Swimming Championships in Atlanta, Georgia.

The transgender University of Pennsylvania swimmer clocked in at 4:33:24 in the women’s 500 freestyle finals Thursday evening, finishing first ahead of the University of Virginia’s Emma Weyant, a freshman.

Thomas will compete in the women’s 200 freestyle Friday evening and the 100 freestyle on Saturday, and is slated to finish second in the 200 freestyle and tenth in the 100 freestyle.

“We’re in uncharted territory for sure,” said Gaines, an ESPN swimming analyst. “This is new.”



The three-time Olympic gold medalist said that he has discussed the present controversy with many members of the swimming world over the past few months — coaches, swimmers, officials, attendees at the NCAA — and many of them are concerned about biological men in women’s sports.


“I’m finding there’s a lot of terms that come up that, terms like the fairness issue and not a level playing field, hopeless, helpless feeling,” he said, adding that some people he has spoken with have articulated that they feel it is “a sad day for the sport.”

“But at the same time, I think most people don’t want to be distracted by what’s going on,” he continued. “They need to focus on — put the blinders on, so to speak, and kind of focus on their task because they can’t really do anything about what’s going on here. They’re just trying to go day by day and doing what they can do.”

“The overwhelming majority” of those whom he has spoken with are talking about fairness, he emphasized, noting, “It’s a fairness issue.”


Lia Thomas has “followed every rule and every protocol” set forward by officials, the Olympic swimmer insisted.

“You can’t blame Lia Thomas,” he said. “You can blame the decision, but she’s doing what she’s been given a right to do.”

“I don’t know who it is that makes those kind of decisions,” he continued. “It’s not an easy decision to make for anybody. None of us have ever experienced anything like this. So I have to give the benefit of the doubt to the decision makers on this as well as anybody else.”

It’s unlikely that the female swimmers would weigh in on present controversies during the actual NCAA events, he said, since they are so focused on their upcoming races.

“Now you may hear a lot next week,” he predicted. “But this week, you know, everybody’s got their nose to grindstone.”

“You have to understand, these kids swim six to 10 miles a day, six days a week,” he said. “Think about running six to 10 months, and you’re swimming six to 10 miles. And they’ve been doing it for eight months now, day in and day out, on top of going to school every day.”

“If it was me, total chaos could be going on around me, and I wouldn’t be paying attention to it because I worked too hard to get there,” he said.

Gaines pushed back on criticisms of female swimmers who do not speak out against biological males participating in their sports.

“It’s not the girls’ fault,” he said. “Their job is to swim here … their job is to perform at the highest level as a college athlete, as a student athlete. When did people tell them it was their job to speak up?”

As the father of four daughters and the grandfather to five grandchildren, Gaines said he is “sensitive to this issue” and feels for “both sides.” He described himself as a “dopey” onlooker who comments on sports on TV.

“My job is really just to talk about the race and analyze the races,” he said. “But at the same time, you know, I like to get a pulse of what people are feeling.”",https://www.dailywire.com/news/exclusive-3x-olympic-gold-medalist-says-swimming-world-overwhelmingly-concerned-about-fairness-in-womens-sports,"The collegiate swimming world is “overwhelmingly” concerned about fairness in women’s sports, three-time Olympic gold medalist Rowdy Gaines said Friday.",2022-03-19
The Daily Wire,‘It Is Not Cute’: Fans React To Pete Davidson Branding Kim Kardashian’s Name On His Body After…,I,"Fans are attempting to paint Kim Kardashian’s new relationship with “SNL” star Pete Davidson as a saner, calmer existence than what she had with ex-husband Kanye West. “KUWTK” fans find it adorable that this couple goes to the movies on Staten Island and hits In-N-Out for burgers like regular people. However, those same fans were slightly taken aback by Kardashian’s latest admission about her new beau.

During a recent appearance on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” the reality star shared a few details about her relationship, which included the confirmation that Davidson had gotten “a few” tattoos of her name which Kardashian described as “so cute.”


The “Kim” tattoo fans spotted in photos isn’t actually a tattoo; it’s an even more permanent form of body modification. As Kardashian explained to DeGeneres:

“Umm, yeah he has a few tattoos, a few cute ones that he got,” Kim explained. “But this one is a … the ‘Kim’ isn’t a tattoo it’s actually a branding. Like a branding. Because … he wanted to do something that was different. Because the first tattoo he got I was like ‘oh, so cute.’ The second I was like, ‘oh, you know, whatever, so cute.’”

Another tattoo the comedian got in honor of Kardashian says, “my girl is a lawyer.” This alludes to the fact that the 44-year-old reality star passed California’s “baby bar” law exam in December 2021. 


The “KUWTK” alum explained the thoughts behind the branding.“I just think he was like ‘I want something that’s there that I can’t get rid of my tattoos,’” Kardashian continued “Because he’s in the process of getting rid of his arm tats and neck tats. So, he was like ‘I don’t want to be able to get rid of it, cover it up, and I just wanted it there like a scar on me.’”

Some fans were not equally charmed by Davidson’s permanent display of affection, especially considering the couple has only been dating for a few months and Kardashian finalized her divorce from West just two weeks ago.

“Can we stop romanticizing branding. It is not ‘cute’ that Pete Davidson carved Kim K’s name into his skin … it is concerning,” one follower shared on Twitter.


Others pointed out how Davidson tends to get name tattoos of any woman he’s dating, including his ex-fiance Ariana Grande.

“I love Pete but like… this gave me the ick. Like you didn’t learn from the ariana tattoos?????” another fan wondered. Unlike with tattoos, the branding can’t be removed with laser treatments.

“I remember thinking it was a 🚩 when Pete got Ariana’s bunny ears tattooed on his neck. Branding Kim’s name on his chest is next level 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩!!!” another Twitter user agreed.


“Pete Davidson branded Kim’s name on his chest (a woman who he just started dating a few months ago) but claims he wants to ‘help’ Kanye with his mental health. No comment,” another said.

Many fans were expecting Kardashian’s hookup with Davidson to become a short-lived, post-marriage fling and nothing more. However, as time goes by it seems their relationship is getting more serious by the day. The branding and tattoos are just the latest examples of Kardashian and Davidson proving that point.",https://www.dailywire.com/news/it-is-not-cute-fans-react-to-pete-davidson-branding-kim-kardashians-name-on-his-body-after-months-of-dating,"Some fans were not equally charmed by Davidson’s permanent display of affection, especially considering the couple has only been dating for a few months and Kardashian finalized her divorce from West just two weeks ago.

The Daily Wire,"Reminder: These 50 Intelligence Officers Claimed, Without Evidence, That New York Post’s Hunter…",I,"The New York Times on Wednesday finally admitted that the 2020 New York Post story regarding information found on Hunter Biden’s laptop was legitimate.

The Times confirmed the existence of Biden’s laptop in a story about a federal investigation into the son of President Joe Biden.


“People familiar with the investigation said prosecutors had examined emails between Mr. Biden, Mr. [Devon] Archer and others about Burisma and other foreign business activity. Those emails were obtained by The New York Times from a cache of files that appears to have come from a laptop abandoned by Mr. Biden in a Delaware repair shop. The email and others in the cache were authenticated by people familiar with them and with the investigation,” the Times reported.

The information contained on the laptop, first published by the Post in the month before the 2020 election, was undermined by numerous news outlets and social media companies, who tried to suggest it wasn’t real. The Daily Wire previously reported on these attempts by Politico, NPR, The Washington Post, and others.

The Times itself had previously sought to undermine the story with an article titled “New York Post Published Hunter Biden Report Amid Newsroom Doubts,” which emphasized that “The New York Post’s front-page article about Hunter Biden on Wednesday was written mostly by a staff reporter who refused to put his name on it, two Post employees said.”


The Times further claimed that “Many Post staff members questioned whether the paper had done enough to verify the authenticity of the hard drive’s contents, said five people with knowledge of the tabloid’s inner workings. Staff members also had concerns about the reliability of its sources and its timing, the people said.”

But while much of the focus has been on media outlets who attempted to undermine a story that could cause political damage to a favored candidate, one must remember that 50 members of the Intelligence Community released a public statement – published by Politico – that attempted to cast doubt on the laptop story as a “Russian information operation.”

Those who signed the letter included a statement – five paragraphs in – stating that “We want to emphasize that we do not know if the emails, provided to the New York Post by President Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, are genuine or not and that we do not have evidence of Russian involvement — just that our experience makes us deeply suspicious that the Russian government played a significant role in this case.”


Every other word of the statement was written to undermine the credibility of the emails and suggest that Russia was behind the information. Signers of the letter include numerous Obama appointees who went on to become mainstream media commentators, including former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former CIA director John Brennan. Other signers included former Director of National Intelligence Michael Hayden and former CIA director Leon Panetta.

Richard Grenell, former acting Director of National Intelligence under President Donald Trump, tweeted on Thursday that a “Republican Senate MUST hold hearings with all 50 of the people who signed that letter 3 weeks before the 2020 campaign. They all said Hunter Biden’s laptop was Russian disinformation. And they didn’t have a single piece of intel to suggest it.”",https://www.dailywire.com/news/reminder-these-50-intelligence-officers-claimed-without-evidence-that-new-york-posts-hunter-biden-story-was-russian-disinformation,"Richard Grenell, former acting Director of National Intelligence under President Donald Trump, tweeted on Thursday that a “Republican Senate MUST hold hearings with all 50 of the people who signed that letter 3 weeks before the 2020 campaign.

The Daily Wire,‘Somebody Has Got To Come Out And Say Something’: Dad Slams ‘Gatekeepers’ For Making His…,I,"ATLANTA — Felipe Delgado is one of the only parents willing to go on the record and share how he feels about a biological male competing against his daughter.

“I just feel that somebody has got to come out and say something,” he said in a Friday evening interview with The Daily Wire, “but we cannot do this argument with hate. We have to do it in a conversational tone, welcoming dialogue, because that’s the only way things are really going to get resolved.”

“It’s going to be too late once you have to pull back,” he warned. “Once you have to take back awards that have been won. Once you have to erase records that have been had. That’s when the pain is really going to settle in for certain people.”



Delgado sat down with The Daily Wire at the NCAA Women’s Swimming and Diving Championships in Atlanta, Georgia, ahead of his daughter’s Saturday 100 freestyle competition.

Anicka Delgado, a sophomore at the University of Southern California, is currently slated to clock in at 48.56 seconds in the 100 freestyle, 48th out of 65 athletes competing in the event.

Heat sheets show that athlete Lia Thomas, a biological man who identifies as a transgender woman, is slated to clock in at 47.63 seconds — 10th in the race, and the only biological male out of the slew of female racers.


Preliminary races took place Saturday morning and determine who swims in the finals Saturday night: Thomas, who placed fourth with a time of 47:37, will swim this evening, while Delgado, who placed 33 with a time of 48:57, will not.



Thomas finished first in the women’s 500 freestyle Thursday evening. On Friday, multiple female swimmers finished ahead of Thomas in the 200 freestyle.

Delgado’s father made it clear that he believes it is unfair for Thomas to be racing in his daughter’s race, but he emphasized the importance of engaging in dignified and respectful dialogue in order to effect change.

“You have to remember, Lia Thomas is a human being,” he said. “You have to see the human side.”

Thomas is not the gatekeeper, he noted, pointing out that the transgender swimmer is “playing within” the NCAA’s rules.

“Had they established rules that prohibited her from being here, she wouldn’t be here,” Delgado said.

More of the responsibility for the current divisive climate should be put on the NCAA, he said, emphasizing that “we should be focusing on the positive, all of the fantastic accomplishments that are taking place here this this week.”

“I am a believer that there is a gatekeeper,” he said. “And when that gatekeeper allows somebody to come in who potentially shouldn’t be invited to the party, I think ultimately the brunt of the blame, if there is blame to be had, would fall on that person.”


Parents, swimmers, and attendees at the NCAA have been abuzz with concerns about the transgender swimmer and fairness in women’s sports, multiple sources told The Daily Wire.

But few of these parents have voiced their concerns publicly, and the most high profile dissent appears to have come from conservative activists and commentators online.

Delgado initially signaled his feelings in a Wednesday tweet that said: “My daughter will be racing Lia Thomas this weekend in the 100 free at the women’s @NCAA. I’ll be rooting for my daughter.”

“Fight on,” he added in a hashtag.

“Fault those that out of fear of being cancelled or labeled transphobic, [were] not willing to do the right thing and admit that they were wrong,” he tweeted later. “That much more has to go into this before people like Lia can complete fairly.”

“What happens when this reaches the international scene & sporting events like the Olympic Games come into play?” he asked. “Then what?”

The current controversy over Thomas is not the transgender swimmer’s fault, Delgado tweeted.

“Standing up for the integrity of women’s sports does not make one transphobic,” he added. “I just wish those that have power know that.”


“Right now,  I can tell you, the majority of people certainly do not think it’s right,” the swimmer’s father told The Daily Wire. “So we need to sit back and look and see, did we act too quickly? Do we need to step back? Maybe change things around?”

Parents have told him “all weekend long” that they are unhappy about Thomas racing with the girls.

“I don’t think there would be so much discord if people weren’t as passionate as they are about this,” he said. “I have three daughters myself, so I do have a dog in this fight. Women’s sports have come so far just to be thrown right back into question, and that’s what needs to be changed.”",https://www.dailywire.com/news/somebody-has-got-to-come-out-and-say-something-dad-slams-gatekeepers-for-making-his-daughter-swim-against-a-biological-man,ATLANTA — Felipe Delgado is one of the only parents willing to go on the record and share how he feels about a biological male competing against his daughter.,2022-03-18
The Daily Wire,‘It’s Indefinite At This Point’: No End In Sight For NYC COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate For Private…,I,"For the past several weeks, there has been renewed hope that New York City would lift its private sector COVID-19 vaccine mandate following the end of the city’s vaccine mandate pertaining to indoor dining and entertainment on March 7.

The private sector mandate is having a large impact on the sports world, as Brooklyn Nets point guard Kyrie Irving is unable to play in games taking place in New York City, including in his home arena of Barclays Center.


Those hopes were dampened on Friday.

According to ABC7 New York, New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan said the private sector mandate will remain in place indefinitely.

“I think it’s indefinite at this point,” Vasan said. “People who have tried to predict what’s going to happen in the future for this pandemic have repeatedly found egg on their face, as they say. And I’m not going to do that here today.”


“I would love for me to sit here and say, I can give you a date or a data point for when we would lift those things,” he continued. “Right now, we are in a low risk environment, and we will continue to evaluate that data.”

The impact of the mandate has been on full display over the past week.

On Sunday, Irving attended Brooklyn’s game versus the New York Knicks at Barclays Center as a fan, as he was still unable to compete as a member of the Nets in the city of New York. Unvaccinated visiting team players are allowed to play in NYC according to the mandate.


The vaccine mandate may also have a major impact on New York’s two Major League Baseball teams, the New York Mets and the New York Yankees.

According to a report from The New York Times, playing at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx and Citi Field in Queens will not be a possibility for unvaccinated members of the Yankees and the Mets.

On Tuesday, Yankees slugger Aaron Judge was asked about his vaccination status, and his answer provided more questions.


“I’m still focused on getting to the first game of Spring Training,” Judge said at a press conference. “So, I think we’ll cross that bridge whenever the time comes, But right now, so many things could change. So, I’m not really too worried about that right now.”

On Sunday, Yankees manager Aaron Boone confirmed that his roster contains a “few guys” who aren’t vaccinated, meaning those who have refused the COVID-19 vaccine also will not be allowed to travel to Toronto to play the Blue Jays. The Yankees have nine scheduled games in Toronto during the 2022-2023 season and 81 regular season games in New York.

The Daily Wire,‘It’s Unfair’: NCAA Father Says It’s ‘Soul Crushing’ Watching Lia Thomas Obliterate Female…,I,"ATLANTA, GA. — The father of a swimmer competing at the NCAA Women’s Swimming Championship described watching transgender athlete Lia Thomas dominating female swimmers as “unfair” and “soul crushing.”

The transgender University of Pennsylvania swimmer clocked in at 4:33:24 in the women’s 500 freestyle finals Thursday evening, finishing first ahead of the University of Virginia’s Emma Weyant, a freshman.


Thomas will compete in the women’s 200 freestyle Friday evening and the 100 freestyle on Saturday. The transgender swimmer is slated to finish second in the 200 freestyle and tenth in the 100 freestyle.

“I just don’t think it’s fair,” said the father of a swimmer from Virginia who asked not to be identified in order to preserve his daughter’s anonymity. “These young ladies have worked too hard to be treated like that.”

The dad expressed concerns in an interview with The Daily Wire that weighing in publicly on controversy over Thomas would embroil his daughter in criticism that might endanger her future job prospects.


While some onlookers cheered as the transgender athlete was announced the winner on Thursday evening, the stands also resonated with a chorus of boos and yells.

The Virginia dad said that it has been “incredibly obvious” from where he has been sitting in the stands that parents “don’t appear to be supportive of Lia Thomas.”

“It happened several times yesterday when he finished, when he touched the wall and finished,” the father explained. “Nobody clapped, really. When the second place person came in, the place exploded.”


“You saw the same thing on the podium,” he added. “You know, everybody cheered loudly for the second place finisher, the girl. And not very many people clapped for the champion.”

The transgender swimmer’s presence is noticeable on the pool deck — aside from the fact that Thomas stands taller than many of the swimmers, the athlete also clearly has male anatomy.

“Soul crushing would be not an understatement,” said the father, asked how it felt to watch Thomas win over a pool of biological women.


“I can look at swimmers and tell whether they’re really good,” he said, noting that he doesn’t believe Thomas is exerting as much effort as the female swimmers are.  “And I don’t think that [Thomas] is having to put out as much as the girls are put out to compete as well.”

“They’re going out there doing it all and and they’re leaving it all in the pool as it were,” the father continued. “And I just don’t see that that he’s having to do the same thing.”

One consistent criticism of transgender athletes in women’s spaces has been that biological males should not be present or be changing in women’s locker rooms.

The Virginia dad said he doesn’t know anything firsthand about Thomas and locker rooms, but emphasized that he believes “males should be in a male locker room and biological females should be in a female locker room.”

“I’m not comfortable with my daughter being in a locker room with male,” he said. “I think that’s wrong and disgusting.”

He described the years of dedication and time that his daughter, who will compete against Thomas during the NCAA championship, has put into becoming a swimmer worthy of such a championship.

“I drove nine hours to clap for my daughter for a little under 22 seconds,” he chuckled.

Asked if he thinks the work was worth it: “Absolutely. Every bit of it. She’s an amazing young lady, and I’m excited for her future.”",https://www.dailywire.com/news/its-unfair-ncaa-father-says-its-soul-crushing-watching-lia-thomas-obliterate-female-swimmers,"ATLANTA, GA. — The father of a swimmer competing at the NCAA Women’s Swimming Championship described watching transgender athlete Lia Thomas dominating female swimmers as “unfair” and “soul crushing.”",2022-03-19
The Daily Wire,‘Star Trek’ Showrunner Gushes About Stacey Abrams Cameo: ‘Can’t Think Of Anyone Better To…,I,"Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams made a surprise appearance on the last episode of “Star Trek: Discovery” season 4, IndieWire reported. She appeared in the episode as the president of Earth.

The former state representative is an avid “Star Trek” fan, but even so, viewers were surprised to see her acting in the sci-fi series. 


“I’m still floored when I think about Stacey gracing us with her presence in our Season 4 finale,” actress Sonequa Martin-Green said breathlessly to Deadline. “We spent so much of our time fanning out and pretending to be cool in her midst.”

Martin-Green plays Discovery captain Michael Burnham, the first black woman captain. She went on to call Abrams “a legend in the making and a civil hero, and she was an absolute delight to work with.”

“She wowed us with her charm, humility, and generosity, and she whipped out some acting chops too!” Martin-Green continued. “It was an honor for me as a Black woman to stand with her in the story. It’s an experience I’ll cherish for the rest of my life.”



Showrunner Michelle Paradise told IndieWire how she’s still in disbelief that Abrams was on the show. “Honestly, the number of times I’ve seen the episode, every time I see her face, I’m like, ‘Wow, that really happened. That’s awesome.’”


The casting process started as a hypothetical. 

“And as we got into season four and got halfway through breaking it, we realized: We need a person to represent Earth. And then the question became: who should that person be? I don’t remember where the idea came from, honestly. But I texted Alex to say, ‘What do you think of Stacey Abrams?’ Immediately, [he sent] exclamation points,” Paradise told the publication. 

“And he said, ‘Let’s set up a meeting. Let’s talk to her. Let’s see.’ So we did. And she was so kind. And we got on Zoom with her, and we pitched her where we were for the season and who this character was and what this character would represent. And asked if she would be a part of this with us. Honestly, I can’t think of anyone better to represent the president of Earth in all of that.”


Paradise revealed that Abrams helped develop the character, too.

“When she saw the script and we started talking about costumes and stuff like that, it was just really wanting her input on those things,” the showrunner said. “It’s a character that she needs to embody. She’s so collaborative and was really just wonderful about all of it. It really was just such a treat to have her there and get to have her in Toronto on set.”

Abrams is a SAG-AFTRA cardholder. Her previous acting credits include voicing herself on the two-episode election themed animated “Black-ish” in October 2020.

As for whether Abrams will have another “Star Trek” cameo, Paradise said she’s more than open to it.

“Oh my gosh, I would love that,” Paradise said. “I mean, I have no idea. She’s certainly busy doing other things.” 

Abrams is running for governor in Georgia in 2022 after a failed bid in 2018. The Atlanta resident famously refused to concede to her opponent, Gov. Brian Kemp, because she believed voter suppression skewed the election results.

Abrams has since launched Fair Fight, a group created to “put in place the guardrails that ensure every American has an equal opportunity to make their voice heard and be fairly represented.”",https://www.dailywire.com/news/star-trek-showrunner-gushes-about-stacey-abrams-cameo-cant-think-of-anyone-better-to-represent-the-president-of-earth,"“And he said, ‘Let’s set up a meeting.

The Daily Wire,Megyn Kelly Slams Lia Thomas: This ‘Is Not The Women’s Champion’ And Has ‘Some Nerve’…,I,"Megyn Kelly criticized Penn swimmer, Lia Thomas, a biological male who identifies as a female, after Thomas took first place in the NCAA Women’s Swimming Championship 500 yard freestyle race on Thursday.

“This is a farce,” the host of the Sirius XM “The Megyn Kelly Show” podcast tweeted Friday to her million of followers.


“Lia Thomas is not the women’s champion and has some nerve standing there pretending to be,” she added. “There is a way to allow TG [Transgender] rights without decimating women’s sports. This ain’t it.”


The former Fox News host’s post included a Daily Mail article with a photo taken on the medal podium showing Thomas standing in first place next to second place winner University of Virginia swimmer Emma Weyant followed by University of Texas swimmer Erica Sullivan. In the photo it couldn’t be more clear the difference in size between the biological male vis-a-vis Weyant and Sullivan.


The article included many congratulatory posts to Weyant, including the message that “second is the new first” and that Weyant is the “real winner.”





As reported by The Daily Wire, Thomas, who previously competed against males before identifying as a woman, was greeted by cheers from onlookers at the competition Thursday.

Onlookers cheered Thursday evening as a biological man who identifies as a transgender woman annihilated female competitors in a collegiate race.

University of Pennsylvania swimmer Lia Thomas clocked in at 4:33:24, finishing first in the NCAA Women’s Swimming Championship 500 yard freestyle.

The University of Virginia’s Emma Weyant, a freshman, finished second with 4 minutes 34 seconds and 99 milliseconds, dropping 2 seconds and 26 milliseconds from her previous time.

Erica Sullivan, a freshman from the University of Texas, finished third at 4 minutes, 35 seconds, and 92 milliseconds.


After the win, ESPN spoke to Thomas about what the win meant amid the “spotlight” the swimmer’s been under.

“I try to ignore it as much as a I can,” Thomas shared. “I try to focus on my swimming, what I need to do to get ready for my races, and just try to block out everything else.”",https://www.dailywire.com/news/megyn-kelly-levels-lia-thomas-says-this-is-not-the-womens-champion-and-has-some-nerve-pretending-to-be,"Megyn Kelly criticized Penn swimmer, Lia Thomas, a biological male who identifies as a female, after Thomas took first place in the NCAA Women’s Swimming Championship 500 yard freestyle race on Thursday.

The Daily Wire,He Said Race Relations Have Improved Since The 1930s. Someone Reported Him To The School Bias…,I,"A professor at the State University of New York (SUNY)-Cortland was reported after he told his class that race and gender relations had improved since the 1930s.

The professor, whose name has not been reported, had apparently began his first class of the semester by saying he was not “one of those America-is-evil academics,” according to a student who filed a complaint against the professor afterward.


The professor also allegedly said that younger generations need to understand that America has made progress since the 1930s, and that “we should be proud of how far we’ve come as a society relating to race and gender relations.” The professor apparently went on to say that when he was growing up, “women only aspired to mediocrity,” but that was not the case anymore and that things are better now.

A student taking the class took offense and reported the professor to SUNY-Cortland’s Bias Response Team, an avenue for students and staff to report each other over perceived insults. This particular complaint was uncovered by The College Fix, who received the documentation from a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. The names of those who were reported, and the complainants were redacted from the documents provided to the Fix.

The student who filed the complaint claimed that “This seemed incredibly tone-deaf, and completely unnecessary and unrelated to our syllabus.”


“It made me sick to my stomach because it was clear that people had tried to educate him, and he was firmly within his beliefs and ignorance,” the student added.

The Fix reported that the student also claimed “the professor had said that many people today blame outside sources such as discrimination for their problems instead of taking accountability for themselves.”

The report against the professor was not the only one discovered by the FOIA request. The Fix discovered about three dozen complaints in total that had been filed since January 2020 (just before the pandemic shut down many colleges in the U.S.), the outlet noted:


Other complaints included a professor who used the terms “redsk*n” and “Squ*w” when discussing Peter Pan, a student who yelled “shut up, I’m trying to sleep” at Black Lives Matter protesters, and a dorm resident who called her roommate a “Dyke-A-Saurus Rex.”

Many cases involved professors getting reported for what they said in class, the Fix reported, including the Peter Pan incident.

“While talking about Peter Pan, for class, because he is the professor, he really did say both ‘redsk*n’ and ‘Squ*w’ out loud,” the student complaint said. “While he was referencing the fact that the depiction of native people in that novel was stereotypical and offensive, he also literally said those out loud. They’re slurs used against indigenous people, he didn’t have to actually say them in order to explain the problematic depiction in the novel?”


SUNY-Cortland’s website explains that the bias reporting form allows students and faculty to report each other for perceived slights involving “(dis)ability, age, ethnicity, gender/sexism, gender identity/expression, nationality/immigration status, physical appearance, race, faith/non-faith, sexual orientation, and/or socio-economic status/class.”

“We at SUNY Cortland are committed to mitigating behavior and conditions that work against the richness of a diverse and inclusive community,” the website says. “Biased related incidents on the SUNY Cortland campus are of great concern for all members of the campus community. A biased related incident not only impacts people at an individual level, it negatively impacts our entire community.”",https://www.dailywire.com/news/he-said-race-relations-have-improved-since-the-1930s-someone-reported-him-to-the-school-bias-team,"The professor also allegedly said that younger generations need to understand that America has made progress since the 1930s, and that “we should be proud of how far we’ve come as a society relating to race and gender relations.” The professor apparently went on to say that when he was growing up, “women only aspired to mediocrity,” but that was not the case anymore and that things are better now.

The Daily Wire,‘This S*** Needs To Stop’: ‘The Boys’ Actress Karen Fukuhara Says She Was Assaulted In Alleged…,I,"“The Boys” actress Karen Fukuhara made a statement against anti-Asian violence while telling her fans about what she suggested was a personal and racially motivated attack. The 30-year-old California native recalled a situation in which, she says, a random person struck her in the head then just kept walking. 

“Today I was struck in the head by a man,” she wrote on the Instagram post, assuring followers that she was “physically fine” following the incident. “This s*** needs to stop. Us women, Asians and the elderly need your help.”

She included the hashtag “Stop Asian Hate” with the post, proving she believed the attack to be related to her being Asian. The “Suicide Squad” alum did not elaborate on where the incident took place.


“I rarely share about my private life but something happened today that I thought was important,” Fukuhara wrote. “I was walking to a cafe for some coffee and a man struck me in the back of my head. It came out of nowhere. We made no eye contact before, I wasn’t doing anything out of the ordinary. It came to my surprise and my hat flew off. By the time I looked back, he was a few feet away from me (he must have kept walking after hitting me).”

Fukuhara explained how she thought about “confronting” her attacker but realized it “wasn’t worth the risk.” She recalled, “After a few seconds of staring at each other, and him yelling at me, he eventually walked away.”

“I write this, because I’ve had conversations with multi-racial friends of mine that had no idea these hate crimes happen to everyday, regular people — people that they share meals with,” she went on. “I felt it was important to raise awareness.”

The Los Angeles native revealed that this incident has led her to think about taking self-defense classes after the “shock” of the attack. She also expressed relief that her attacker didn’t have a weapon on him.

“Why is this something we as ‘victims’ have to think about?” Fukuhara wondered. “What satisfaction are these perpetrators getting from hitting women, Asians, the elderly? They need to be held accountable. What can we do as a community to prevent these horrible crimes?”

The comments on the Instagram post were flooded with support from fans, including some of the star’s co-stars from “The Boys.” 

“F this person!! Hope you’re ok this is awful,” actor Chace Crawford wrote.

“Karen thank you for sharing your experience,” Jack Quaid said. “I’m sorry that happened to you. Love you. Here if you need anything.”

Laz Alonso wrote, “This pisses me off. Wish I was there….”

Fellow Asian American actress Olivia Munn, who has also been vocal about Asian hate crime awareness, also shared her support for Fukuhara. “I’m so grateful you’re safe,” she commented.",https://www.dailywire.com/news/this-s-needs-to-stop-the-boys-actress-karen-fukuhara-says-she-was-assaulted-in-alleged-asian-hate-crime-attack,"“The Boys” actress Karen Fukuhara made a statement against anti-Asian violence while telling her fans about what she suggested was a personal and racially motivated attack.

The Daily Wire,‘I Don’t Want Women To Feel The Way That I Did’: Female Track Athlete Forced To Compete Against…,I,"A young woman who competed against a biologically male track runner in college weighed in on controversy over transgender swimmer Lia Thomas, saying that allowing males in female competitions is a “disservice” to “all women in sports.”

Linnea Saltz won the 800 meter track race in the Big Sky Conference Outdoor Championship in 2019. As she headed into her senior year of college, she was informed that a biologically male athlete who formerly ran on the University of Montana men’s track team, had taken a red shirt year — and that athlete would now be competing against her as a woman.

The former track athlete joined protestors from the “Save Women’s Sports” organization outside the NCAA Division I Championship meet in Atlanta, Georgia on Thursday as transgender swimmer Lia Thomas, a biological male, crushed female competitors in the 500 freestyle.

Saltz, who was hoping to win the Big Sky Conference Outdoor Championship and potentially pursue an All-American track title, told The Daily Wire that she was incredibly discouraged to be told by her coaches that she would have to face a biological male, who goes by the name June Eastwood.

“I just thought to myself, ‘Well, I’m so excited to go and defend my title again, but am I not going to have that opportunity anymore? Because now a man who has competed and run ten seconds faster than me in the eight hundred, I’m now going to have to defend my title against somebody that already possesses this physiological biological advantage over me?'”

“It was just really disappointing, and it was hard for me to understand why the NCAA would allow something like that to happen,” she said.

Saltz said that she believes many of the people on her team and within the conference felt that they were not being heard and they did not have an opportunity to race on a level playing field.

“That’s why I come out to things like this is because I don’t want women to feel the way that I did,” she said, gesturing around her at small groups of protestors outside the NCAA women’s championships. “I don’t want women to feel the way that my teammates did. It’s a disservice honestly to all women in sports.”

Saltz told The Daily Wire that she observed a swimmer crying on Thursday.


“One of our women over here was like, ‘Why don’t you speak out about it,'” Saltz said. “And they said, ‘Well, I’m scared. I can’t be walking around wearing my university’s brand and talking about this.'”

Saltz said she pulled aside the girls and told them, “Well, I did.”

“I used to compete at Southern Utah University,” the former track athlete said that she told the students. “I went and spoke with my president. I spoke with the athletic director I spoke with as EU counsel, and I told them, ‘Listen, whether you believe me or not, or whether you agree with my opinion or not, I’m going forward with this. Then I’m going towards the NCAA and I don’t know if you’re going to be on my side or not, but I just want you to know what I’m doing.'”

Saltz said that she was fully supported by her university, emphasizing that she felt lucky to be at a university that was completely on her side.

“I know that I may not be an athlete now, but I did come out and advocate for this issue then, and people are just as hateful to me now as they were back then,” she said she told the swimmers. “It’s never going to be different. And so I may be receiving a lot of hate…I’ve had athletes that I’ve competed against a multitude of times, say really hateful, hurtful things towards me because of my opinions.”

Critics of those who support women’s sports often insist they would never tear down other women, Saltz said.

“But that’s exactly what they’re doing to me when I’m trying to speak on behalf of women athletes,” she added.

Saltz raced her transgender competitor at the Big Sky indoor conference championship in February 2020, right before the coronavirus pandemic began. The athlete did not race Saltz in the 800-meter competition, which Saltz won.

But as Saltz and her teammates competed against the transgender athlete in a relay race, she overheard the University of Montana coach telling Eastwood to slow down.

“That was the sticking point for me,” she said. “And that honestly made me and all of my advocacy efforts feel worth it because it just was so clear to me that my coach would never tell me to slow down.”

“No coach would tell you to slow down,” she added, suggesting that the University of Montana coach told the transgender athlete to slow down in order to not crush competitors by too much. “The whole point of track and field is you completely exhaust yourself on the track we call emptying the tank. We want everything to be depleted by the time you cross the finish line. So you would never tell your athlete to slow down. You would tell them to push it to their ultimate limits.”",https://www.dailywire.com/news/i-dont-want-women-to-feel-the-way-that-i-did-female-track-athlete-forced-to-compete-against-biological-male-speaks-out,"A young woman who competed against a biologically male track runner in college weighed in on controversy over transgender swimmer Lia Thomas, saying that allowing males in female competitions is a “disservice” to “all women in sports.”

The Daily Wire,"WATCH: Virginia Tech Swimmer Speaks Out Against Lia Thomas Swimming In Women’s Event, Says…",I,"One Virginia Tech swimmer spoke out publicly this week after a teammate was crushed by the “inclusion” of biologically male transgender swimmer Lia Thomas, who handily took first place in the NCAA Women’s Swimming Championship 500 yard freestyle on Thursday.

“It’s a common conception that we are all very disappointed and frustrated with someone who has capabilities more than us women have,” the swimmer told Rapid Fire’s Savanah Hernandez, according to Outkick. “To be able to compete at this level and take opportunities away from other women.”

The female competitor was wearing a sticker that reads, “Say no to males competing as females.”

“I’ve got a teammate who did not make the final today because she was just bumped out of finals,” the collegiate swimmer revealed. “It’s heartbreaking to see someone who went through puberty as a male and has the body of a male be able to absolutely blow away the competition.”

“You go into it with the mindset that you don’t have a chance,” she continued. “It’s hard to compete against someone with the aerobic capacity, the muscle development, the body of a man. It’s hard; it’s hard to think about it like that. … It’s disappointing to see and frustrating.”

One of her teammates was brought to tears after she came in 17th place, missing the finals by one place, because of Thomas’ “inclusion.”

“She was very emotional, and it’s hard to see because it’s her last NCAAs; she really loves that race, and it was just heartbreaking that she put all of her efforts into it today … one of the best times that’s she went in a morning session and still not make it back,” the swimmer described. “It’s hard to see someone who works every day and every night still not be able to compete against someone like that.”

The Daily Wire,Virginia School District Knew About Alleged Sexual Assault That Left Victim In Hospital. They…,I,"According to a new report, the Alexandria, Virginia, school district and school board did not inform parents in the school district regarding a reported violent sexual assault that left the victim in the hospital.

“Alexandria police have now directly confirmed to Independent Women’s Forum via email that the police arrested a 14-year-old suspect in early December for ‘aggravated sexua[l] battery, rape, and forcible sodomy’ in connection with the October incident at Minnie Howard campus,” Inez Stepman of National Review reported on Friday, adding that a series of emails were sent vis-à-vis the incident between school-board members, the superintendent, the mayor, and Alexandria police. “Parents, however, were largely left in the dark,” National Review noted.

Molly Kaiman, an Alexandria City Public Schools parent, who said she felt “misled, angry, [and] scared,” charged, “Parents had zero communication regarding this incident. This crime should scare parents. If parents knew what had happened, parents could have necessary talks with their children and pressure the school to increase safety.”

The only public notification of the reported assault came at a joint board-council hearing, at which it was mentioned that “a potential sexual assault … is being investigated.”

“On October 6, 2021, ACPS superintendent Gregory Hutchings sent an email to the nine-member ACPS school board with the subject ‘Potential Sexual Assault,’” National Review reported. “The body of the email contained few details but did say … ‘FYI there is a potential sexual assault of a student by other students this afternoon at MH. The student has been taken to the hospital and APD is working through the investigation. No more details at this time.’”

Mayor Justin Wilson and all city councilors were reportedly notified. But days later a parent emailed Hutchings, then-acting Alexandria City police chief Don Hayes, and the mayor to confirm the reported sexual assault and other alleged violent incidents in the school district.

The district and school-board officials reportedly did not respond, but Hayes confirmed that a sexual assault at the school was under investigation.

Stepman wrote, “The behavior of ACPS and the city council goes far beyond the city of Alexandria. The secrecy surrounding serious crimes at Virginia schools risks becoming systematized. … In November 2021, a bill was introduced to reverse the earlier law and to require reporting of serious misdemeanor crimes. Additionally, the new law requires that parents be notified of such crimes in their children’s schools and be informed of their rights to press charges through the justice system.

This is not the first episode in Virginia where a reported sexual assault has created headlines; last October, The Daily Wire’s investigative reporter Luke Rosiak broke the story that the Loudoun County school board had lied about a rape in a girls’ bathroom by a boy wearing a skirt, a story that affected the gubernatorial election.",https://www.dailywire.com/news/virginia-school-district-knew-about-alleged-sexual-assault-that-left-victim-in-hospital-they-didnt-tell-districts-parents-report,"According to a new report, the Alexandria, Virginia, school district and school board did not inform parents in the school district regarding a reported violent sexual assault that left the victim in the hospital.",2022-03-18
The Daily Wire,Attorney Representing Mother Of Hunter Biden’s 3-Year-Old Daughter: ‘I Expect Him To Be…,I,"The attorney representing the mother of Hunter Biden’s 3-year-old daughter said this week that he expects Hunter Biden, son of Democrat President Joe Biden, to be indicted for tax fraud.

The mother, Lunden Alexis Roberts, testified to a federal grand jury in Delaware this week in a criminal investigation into Hunter Biden, according to her attorney, Clint Lancaster. The New York Post noted that Roberts, a former stripper, “was once on Hunter Biden’s payroll at his consulting firm.”

Lancaster said that he had already turned over “a significant amount of Hunter’s financial records” to federal law enforcement officials.

“I expect him to be indicted,” Lancaster told CNBC. “Just based on what I saw in his financial records, I would be surprised if he’s not indicted.”

Lancaster said that he turned over the financial records as part of the case for an Arkansas child support lawsuit filed against Hunter Biden.

He said that he witnessed “a lot of information” that was “problematic” for Hunter Biden, although he declined to state what he saw.

The New York Times reported this week that the criminal investigation into Hunter Biden also involved his lobbying work in countries around the world:

Mr. Biden’s extensive work with foreign businesses came under scrutiny from prosecutors looking into whether he should have registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent. Investigators have examined Mr. Biden’s relationships with interests in Kazakhstan, a Chinese energy conglomerate and Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company, according to people familiar with the investigation.

They said prosecutors had investigated payments and gifts Mr. Biden or his associates had received from foreign interests, including a vehicle paid for using funds from a company associated with a Kazakh oligarch and a diamond from a Chinese energy tycoon. Prosecutors also sought documents related to corporate entities through which Mr. Biden and his associates conducted business with interests around the world.

Regarding the child support case in Arkansas, Hunter Biden had previously tried to claim that he did not father a child with Roberts, which came as he was living with the widow of his deceased brother. However, a DNA test reportedly showed that Hunter Biden was, in fact, the father.

“DNA testing has established, ‘with scientific certainty,’ that Hunter Biden is the father of an Arkansas baby, according to a motion filed Wednesday in Independence County on behalf of the child’s mother, Lunden Alexis Roberts,” The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported. “Hunter Biden, who initially denied having sexual relations with Roberts, eventually agreed to take a DNA test, according to documents filed by Roberts’ attorney, Clint Lancaster.”

When asked if Hunter Biden had ever seen his 3-year-old daughter, Lancaster said, “No, he has not.”",https://www.dailywire.com/news/attorney-representing-mother-of-hunter-bidens-3-year-old-daughter-i-expect-him-to-be-indicted,"The attorney representing the mother of Hunter Biden’s 3-year-old daughter said this week that he expects Hunter Biden, son of Democrat President Joe Biden, to be indicted for tax fraud.",2022-03-18
The Daily Wire,"‘People Listen To Us’: Mark Ruffalo, Leonardo DiCaprio, Others Demand Bank To Defund Canada Gas…",I,"A group of A-list celebrities recently signed a letter to City National’s parent company, the Royal Bank of Canada, demanding that they defund the Canada Gas pipeline. 

According to Fox News, the open letter pleads with the Royal Bank of Canada to “withdraw support from the Coastal GasLink pipeline, effective immediately” because they are “bankrolling the climate crisis and violating the rights of Indigenous Peoples.”

The signatures include more than 65 famous names. Mark Ruffalo, Leonardo DiCaprio, Ben Stiller, Scarlett Johansson, Taika Waititi, Jane Fonda, Susan Sarandon, and Robert Downey Jr., Josh Gad, Mariska Hargitay, Rooney Mara, Julianne Moore, Joaquin Phoenix, Amy Schumer, and Marisa Tomei are among those asking for the bank to withdraw financial support.

When asked why celebrities were speaking on this, Ruffalo said it was because they have a platform and “people listen to us,” according to Canadian news site Global News.

He continued, “We have this privilege and we have to use it for the right thing. None of this matters if our children can’t drink the water, they can’t breathe the air, they can’t go outside, the world burns around them. None of this means anything anymore. We’re becoming desensitized to this insanity that we’re living in.”

The actor is known for taking stances on climate change issues specifically. 

“We have a responsibility to each other,” Ruffalo explained during a press conference Wednesday. “And it’s time for good people and privileged people, like us, to do the right thing. To make other people, good people, uncomfortable. That’s the only way we’re going to break through this system of racism and harm.”

Several of those celebrities headed to social media, urging their fans to join in the fight against the pipeline. They used the hashtag #NoMoreDirtyBanks with their posts.

Ruffalo posted a video to YouTube explaining his stance. 

“Right now, major banks like the Royal Bank of Canada are financing a fracked gas pipeline bulldozing through the land of the Wet’suwet’en nation in Northern British Columbia, Canada,” the activist actor said. “The Wet’suwet’en hereditary chiefs never consented to this pipeline construction through their terrorities, which would risk the sacred headwaters of the Wedzin Kwa River, but here’s where it gets complicated.”

Ruffalo continued, “The Supreme Court of Canada recognized Wet’suwet’en hereditary chiefs as rightful title holders of the land, but corporations still get away with consulting only ‘elected leadership’ put in place by the colonial government.”


He also shared on Twitter his thanks for other Hollywood names who signed the letter with him. “Thank you to everyone who signed this. The time to defund @CoastalGasLink is now. @RBC must withdraw from the Coastal GasLink fracked gas pipeline now and stop financing fossil fuels. @CityNational Bank must protect its clients and honor their values,” Ruffalo wrote on Twitter while sharing a link to the Hollywood Reporter article detailing the letter’s contents.",https://www.dailywire.com/news/people-listen-to-us-mark-ruffalo-leonardo-dicaprio-others-demand-bank-to-defund-canada-gas-pipeline,"A group of A-list celebrities recently signed a letter to City National’s parent company, the Royal Bank of Canada, demanding that they defund the Canada Gas pipeline. ",2022-03-18
The Daily Wire,AOC Links ‘Fossil Fuel Extraction’ To The Murder Of Indigenous Women. Here’s Why It Doesn’t…,I,"During a congressional hearing, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) attempted to tie “fossil fuel extraction” to the kidnapping, rape, and murder of American Indian women. She intimated that local police officers helped facilitate this violence by protecting the safety of pipeline workers from violent environmentalist activists. And she seemed to blame the Keystone XL pipeline for crimes that took place in areas where it had not been built.

AOC, who blames fossil fuels for climate change and has asked bank executives if they should be held responsible for climate change because of their services to the energy industry, said she found a “very meaningful connection” between “fossil fuel extraction sites and abductions and murders of indigenous women.”

Ocasio-Cortez said “ruthless” oil companies encourage violence, and she accused unnamed state legislatures of “authorizing and almost legalizing the use of violence against fossil fuel protesters.” In fact, environmentalist protesters have frequently threatened — or perpetrated —  violence against oil and gas industry workers, especially at pipeline worksites. For instance:

A team of 20 environmentalist extremists attacked a pipeline worksite with axes and shot flare guns at workers in British Columbia. They felled trees across roadways and threw torches at the Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers who responded. A policeman called the February 17 assault on the Coastal Gaslink pipeline “a calculated and organized violent attack that left its victims shaken and a multimillion dollar path of destruction.” No arrests were made;
In September 2016, a group of protesters attacked pipeline workers near the Standing Rock reservation, injuring four security officers and two dogs; and
One protester against the Dakota Access Pipeline shot at police three times with a .38 caliber pistol. Other demonstrators threatened cops with Molotov cocktails and hurled feces at them. Security guards also say the Green activists attacked them, flashing a handgun and a knife.
Ocasio-Cortez seemed outraged that local police officers would “protect their extraction sites” from such protests, “even when workers are raping and killing indigenous women.”

AOC seemed to say that proposing a pipeline caused murders to increase. The congresswoman reported that 10% of indigenous murders or kidnappings that took place in “states affiliated with pipeline projects” had “occurred in counties where the Keystone Pipeline alone is proposed to be built.” Ocasio-Cortez did not explain how the future construction of the pipeline retroactively caused deaths and kidnappings to occur in the past.


The hearing drew attention to the tangled, overlapping web of police jurisdictions that come into play at a reservation; unfortunately, not all of its conclusions were accurate.

AOC’s witness — Angel Charley, executive director of the Coalition to Stop Violence Against Native Women — testified that oil and natural gas companies set up “man camps” for pipeline workers, who abuse American Indians with impunity, because “many tribes do not have tribal jurisdiction over non-Native workers.”

Ocasio-Cortez asked whether this means criminals “essentially escape jurisdiction from having a clear path to accountability because of where these sites are happening.” Charley agreed.

In fact, all crimes that take place on reservations are punishable — and some law enforcement officers say giving reservations more jurisdiction may reduce the number of prosecutions. “The FBI has exclusive jurisdiction for about 20 serious crimes on Indian land such as murder, rape, robbery, etc., and will come in and take over any investigation when and if those crimes occur,” Tim Dees, a former tribal law officer, explained. Some tribes allow local police departments to make arrests and bring charges on their land, while others entrust this exclusively to tribal law enforcement officers.

Reservations are a frequent haven for American Indian fugitives. “Tribal governments are notoriously political, and taking enforcement action against a favored person, such as the tribal chairman’s nephew, could be fatal to one’s career,” Dees wrote. South Dakota reservations sheltered 22% of all active felony warrants issued by the Pennington County Sheriff’s Office in 2018.

For her final question, Ocasio-Cortez asked Charley to explain “how this collaboration between law enforcement and fossil fuel companies puts indigenous women, in particular, at heightened risk of abduction and murder.”

Charley cited no facts and replied with only one sentence: “This is a continuation of state violence against indigenous women.”

“I think what we see here is that the data speaks [sic] for itself,” Ocasio-Cortez replied.

The Bronx socialist’s comments came during a March 3 congressional hearing on “The Neglected Epidemic of Missing BIPOC Women and Girls.” The Democrat-controlled House Oversight and Reform Committee echoed MSNBC’s Joy Reid in bemoaning “missing white woman syndrome.” While the committee asserted without proof that “white women are given vastly higher levels of media attention than women of color,” it admitted “the problem is impossible to measure” due to a lack of data.

In written testimony, Charley blamed the murder rate on “systemic racism” that is “rooted in the devaluation of [i]ndigenous lives since the onset of colonization.” But the committee said, “The disproportionate rate of missing Black and Indigenous women and girls can be attributed to … higher rates of intimate partner violence against BIPOC women than white women.” In 2016, the National Institute of Justice, a U.S. government institution, found American Indian and Alaska Native women were 1.6 times as likely as non-Hispanic white women to suffer domestic violence. The difference in the rate of sexual assaults was not statistically significant.

Critics of the hearing suggested that AOC should spend more time focusing on her own district’s surging crime rate. “Are they drilling in NYC?” asked one Twitter user. New York City experienced 485 murders in 2021, and the number of major crimes committed in the Big Apple — such as homicide, rape, robbery, felonious assault, and burglary/grand theft — reached its highest level in five years.",https://www.dailywire.com/news/aoc-links-fossil-fuel-extraction-to-the-murder-rape-and-kidnapping-of-indigenous-women,"A team of 20 environmentalist extremists attacked a pipeline worksite with axes and shot flare guns at workers in British Columbia.

The Daily Wire,‘This Was A South Park Episode’: Social Media Erupts After Lia Thomas Crushes Female…,I,"Social media erupted in criticism after Penn Swimmer Lia Thomas, a biological male who identifies as female, crushed the competition on Thursday evening, taking first in the NCAA Women’s Swimming Championship 500 yard freestyle.

Thomas competed against males before switching over to women’s sports after identifying as a woman. The athlete has dominated in the women’s space.

“All the best women are men,” Daily Wire co-founder Ben Shapiro mocked, adding, “Juwanna Mann is a documentary.”

“Juwanna Mann” is a comedy that depicts a struggling male basketball player pretending to be a woman so he can dominate in women’s professional basketball.



“If you support this, you’re actively participating in the willful destruction of women’s sport & women’s rights to fairness & equality,” Piers Morgan commented. “It’s shameful.”


“The new wave of feminism is admitting we’re second best to men,” Breanna Morello said.


“Absolutely ridiculous and utterly unfair to female competitors,” Henry Bolton said. “The world is going mad.”


“This is a man,” Dominique Samuels posted. “A man who is stealing opportunities from women in sport. Remove this misogynist fraud once and for all.”


“Lia Thomas spent 21 years of his life as a man. Said he is now a woman and in less than a year became a national champion in women’s swimming. And as a society, we’re supposed to accept this as totally okay?” Greg Price questioned. 


“Why is [SportsCenter] even entertaining an interview with ‘Lia’? Go speak with Emma, the real first place winner,” lawyer Jenna Ellis criticized.


Satirical site The Babylon Bee mocked the fiasco with the headline, “After Watching Lia Thomas, Little Girl Adjusts Dreams To Just Winning Second Place At Olympics.”


“Remember when this was a South Park episode?” conservative Matt Palumbo said.


“South Park has become America’s oracle,” Ian Prior echoed.


A years-old episode of South Park shows a masculine man who identifies as female absolutely dominating women in “The Strong Woman Competition.” The male character takes first place and stands on the podium next to two beaten down and shocked women.

Following the win, Thomas spoke to a reporter from ESPN, discussing the “spotlight” the swimmer is under, The Daily Wire reported:

“Lia, how did that performance measure up to your expectations coming into this meet tonight?” the reported asked Thomas.

“I didn’t have a whole lot of expectations for this meet, I was just happy to be here, trying to race and compete as best as I could,” Thomas answered.

“You’ve undoubtedly been under the spotlight over the past few months, how have you been dealing with that, and reasoning with everything?” the reporter followed up.

“I try to ignore it as much as a I can,” Thomas said, “I try to focus on my swimming, what I need to do to get ready for my races, and just try to block out everything else.”

“What did that race mean to you?” the reporter asked.

“It means the world to be here, be with my two best friends and teammates, and be able to compete,” Thomas ended the interview.",https://www.dailywire.com/news/this-was-a-south-park-episode-social-media-erupts-after-lia-thomas-crushes-female-competitors-at-ncaa-tourney,"Social media erupted in criticism after Penn Swimmer Lia Thomas, a biological male who identifies as female, crushed the competition on Thursday evening, taking first in the NCAA Women’s Swimming Championship 500 yard freestyle.",2022-03-18
The Daily Wire,AOC: There’s A Connection Between ‘Fossil Fuel Extraction Sites’ And ‘Murders Of Indigenous…,I,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) claimed during a congressional hearing this week that there was a link between fossil fuel extraction and indigenous women being murdered.

“We have a crisis of missing and murdered indigenous and black women in the United States,” she said. “Today I want to discuss part of this crisis that is all too often overlooked, but whose evidence shows that there’s a very meaningful connection here, the correlation between fossil fuel extraction sites, and abductions and murders of Indigenous women across the United States. We’re very lucky to have Ms. Angel Charley here with us today to start that conversation. Ms. Charley, let’s start at the top. Can you draw a brief introductory picture of how fossil fuel extraction efforts expose Indigenous women to physical and often sexual violence? Why is it that oil, gas, and fossil fuel extraction sites have such a high correlation of violence and abduction against native women?”

“Fossil fuel industry creates man camps, or temporary settlements, that often exist right outside the outside the border lands of indigenous communities,” Charley responded. “As I stated earlier, many tribes do not have tribal jurisdiction over non-native offenders, which a majority of these oil workers are. We know that when these man camps or temporary establishments are created, that there is an increase in violence and particularly sexual violence against our native women.”

“So when there’s a fossil fuel extraction site that is placed on a reservation, and those workers, oil company workers, go to the reservation, have that site, if they commit a crime, and commit violence against indigenous women, you’re saying that they essentially escape jurisdiction from having a clear path to accountability because of where these sites are happening. Is that correct?” AOC asked.

“That is correct,” Charley claimed.

PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT:

REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): We have a crisis of missing and murdered indigenous and black women in the United States. Today I want to discuss part of this crisis that is all too often overlooked, but whose evidence shows that there’s a very meaningful connection here, the correlation between fossil fuel extraction sites, and abductions and murders of Indigenous women across the United States. We’re very lucky to have Ms. Angel Charley here with us today to start that conversation. Ms. Charley, let’s start at the top. Can you draw a brief introductory picture of how fossil fuel extraction efforts expose Indigenous women to physical and often sexual violence? Why is it that oil, gas, and fossil fuel extraction sites have such a high correlation of violence and abduction against native women?

ANGEL CHARLEY: Thank you for that question. Fossil fuel industry creates man camps, or temporary settlements, that often exist right outside the outside the border lands of indigenous communities. As I stated earlier, many tribes do not have tribal jurisdiction over non-native offenders, which a majority of these oil workers are. We know that when these man camps or temporary establishments are created, that there is an increase in violence and particularly sexual violence against our native women.

OCASIO-CORTEZ: So when there’s a fossil fuel extraction site that is placed on a reservation, and those workers, oil company workers, go to the reservation, have that site, if they commit a crime, and commit violence against indigenous women, you’re saying that they essentially escape jurisdiction from having a clear path to accountability because of where these sites are happening.

The Daily Wire,Ukraine’s UN Ambassador Accuses Russia Of ‘Cosplaying The Nazi Third Reich’ – To The Russian…,I,"Sergiy Kyslytsya, Ukraine’s Ambassador to the United Nations, accused Russia of attempting to “cosplay the Nazi Third Reich” during a Thursday meeting of the U.N.’s Security Council.

Kyslytsya made his remarks directly to Russian Ambassador to the U.N. Vasily Nebenzya, who, because of the Security Council’s rotating presidency, had to preside over the meeting even as Kyslytsya called him out.

WATCH:


“Let me begin with a quote. ‘The operation is developing successfully and in strict accordance with plans that have been previously approved,’ end of quote – said by Putin yesterday, three weeks after the unprovoked and unjustified Russian invasion of Ukraine,” Kyslytsya began.

“Over these weeks, the international community has wrestled with the question, why? Why has the Russian Federation decided to cosplay the Nazi Third Reich by attacking the peaceful neighboring state and plunging the region into war? What are the reasons and what is the plan?” Kyslytsya asked.

He then deepened the comparison to the Nazi regime by suggesting that the Russians intended to kill Ukrainian children specifically, noting that civilians had been targeted on numerous occasions and claiming that Russian occupation forces also intentionally targeted children.

“Yesterday, we got the answer: killing Ukrainian children, 108 innocent souls so far. Let me quote again: ‘success and in strict accordance with the plans approved previously,’ according to Putin,” Kyslytsya continued. “Children are deliberate targets, given yesterday’s bombardment of the Mariupol Drama Theater, a shelter for hundreds of local residents, mostly women and children. Despite the big signs, ‘Children’ painted on the road on both sides of the building being clearly visible, Russian pilots dropped an aerial bomb. The building was fully damaged, but the shelter fortunately withstood. It did not turn into one of our mass graves, as Putin’s plan probably envisaged, previously approved.”

Nebenzya claimed that Russia was also concerned that medical facilities in Ukraine had been destroyed, but he claimed that he had no knowledge of who might be at fault.

“Who is at fault when it comes to destroying medical facilities in Ukraine is something we have many questions about,” he said through a translator.

The Daily Wire,"Shocking Details Emerge From Fiery Crash That Killed Golf Teammates, Coach At University Of The…",I,"A National Transportation Safety Board spokesman confirmed this week that a 13-year-old was driving the pickup truck involved in a fatal car crash that left nine people dead, including six college golf teammates from the University of the Southwest and the team’s head coach.

A van carrying members of the golf team leaving Midland College crashed with a Ford pickup truck outside Andrews, Texas, on Tuesday night, KOAT Action News reported.

The driver of the pickup truck, who has now been identified as a 13-year-old, “crossed the median into the northbound lane” and crashed into the university’s van, the report said.

TXDPS Troopers say the pickup truck was traveling southbound on FM 1788 and crossed the median into the northbound lane. After the truck crossed the median it crashed into the van from the University of the Southwest. Both vehicles caught fire shortly after the crash. The team was traveling back to Hobbs from a golf tournament in Midland, TX.

The truck’s left front tire blew out before impact, according to National Transportation Safety Board Vice Chairman Bruce Landsberg, the report detailed.

“A Dodge 2500 pickup was traveling southbound on FM 1788. A Ford Transit passenger van registered to the University of the Southwest in Hobbs, NM was traveling northbound on FM 1788,” the Texas Department of Public Safety said in a statement earlier this week, The Daily Wire reported.

“For unknown reasons, the Dodge pickup drove into the northbound lane and struck the Ford passenger van head on,” DPS Sgt. Steven Blanco said. “Both vehicles caught fire and burned.”

The child who was driving, whose name has not been disclosed, was breaking Texas law by driving underage. He was driving with a 38-year-old man identified as Heinrich Siemens. Both died in the crash.

“We are still learning the details about the accident but we are devastated and deeply saddened to learn about the loss of our students’ lives and their coach,” University of the Southwest President Quint Thurman said in a statement, reacting to the tragedy. “My understanding is that two of our students have survived and have been airlifted to University hospital in Lubbock with serious injuries. We would ask for prayers for their recovery and for comfort and strength for all of families and friends and students of those whose lives have been lost.”

“We extend our condolences to the USW family,” Midland College President Dr. Steve Thomas said. “This is a devastating loss to that school, and words cannot express how deeply hurt we feel for their loss. I have ordered the MC flag to fly at half-staff through Friday to honor the memories of Coach Tyler James and his team.”

The Daily Wire,Feds Charge Five Alleged Chinese Spies For Carrying Out Harassment Campaigns Against U.S.…,I,"Federal law enforcement officials revealed this week that they had charged five alleged Chinese spies for carrying out harassment campaigns against U.S. residents who were critical of the communist Chinese government.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) said that the crimes were related to efforts by China’s secret police, the Ministry of State Security (MSS), to suppress voices of Chinese nationals who speak out against the government.

Three of the five individuals who were charged have been taken into custody, including Fan “Frank” Liu, Matthew Ziburis, and Shujun Wang. The other two individuals, Qiming Lin and Qiang “Jason” Sun, remain at large.

The DOJ said in a statement:

According to court documents, all the defendants allegedly perpetrated transnational repression schemes to target U.S. residents whose political views and actions are disfavored by the PRC government, such as advocating for democracy in the PRC. In one of these schemes, the co-conspirators sought to interfere with federal elections by allegedly orchestrating a campaign to undermine the U.S. congressional candidacy of a U.S. military veteran who was a leader of the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing, PRC. In another of these schemes, three defendants planned to destroy the artwork of a PRC national residing in Los Angeles that was critical of the PRC government, and planted surveillance equipment in the artist’s workplace and car to spy on him from the PRC.

“The Ministry of State Security is more than an intelligence collection agency. It executes the Chinese government’s efforts to limit free speech, attack dissidents, and preserve the power of the Communist Party,” said Assistant Director Alan E. Kohler Jr. of the FBI’s Counterintelligence Division. “When it exports those actions overseas, it violates the fundamental sovereignty of the United States and becomes a national security threat. These indictments should serve as a stark warning to the MSS and all foreign intelligence agencies that their efforts at repression will not be tolerated within our borders.”

The statement highlighted some of the following details about the five alleged spies:

Qiming Lin, 59, of the PRC, is charged with conspiracy to commit interstate harassment, as well as conspiracy and attempt to use of a means of identification in connection with the interstate harassment conspiracy. As alleged, Lin works on behalf of the PRC’s Ministry of State Security (MSS). Beginning in September 2021, Lin hired a private investigator (the PI) in New York to disrupt the campaign of a Brooklyn resident currently running for U.S. Congress (the Victim), including by physically attacking the Victim. The Victim was a student leader of the pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in 1989, who later escaped to the United States, served in the U.S. military, and became a naturalized U.S. citizen. In September 2021, the Victim (then living in Long Island) announced his intention to run for a U.S. congressional seat on Long Island in the November 2022 general election.
Shujun Wang, 73, of Queens, New York, is charged with acting as an agent of the PRC government, criminal use of means of identification and making materially false statements in connection with his participation in a transnational repression scheme orchestrated by the MSS. As alleged, Wang is a former visiting scholar and author who helped start a pro-democracy organization in Queens that memorializes two former leaders of the Chinese Communist Party who promoted political and economic reforms within the PRC and were eventually forced from power. Since at least 2015, however, Wang has secretly operated at the direction and control of several MSS officers. At the direction of the MSS, Wang used his position and status within Chinese diaspora community in New York City to collect information about prominent activists, dissidents, and human rights leaders to report that information to the PRC government. While ostensibly lending a sympathetic ear, Wang reported on statements activists made in confidence to him, including on their views on democracy in the PRC, as well as planned speeches, writings, and demonstrations against the Chinese Communist Party. … In April 2020, one victim about whom Wang reported – the Hong Kong democracy activist identified in the complaint as Hong Kong Dissident #1 – was arrested in Hong Kong and jailed on political charges. In addition, in April 2019, Wang flew from the PRC to Queens carrying a handwritten document with the names and non-public contact information for dozens of other well-known PRC dissidents, including other Hong Kong democracy activists who were subsequently arrested by the PRC in 2019 and 2020. The complaint also alleges that, during an interview in Queens on Aug. 2, 2017, Wang lied to federal law enforcement, falsely denying that he had contacts with PRC officials or the MSS when in fact he had been secretly reporting on U.S. residents to the MSS. Wang later admitted much of his criminal conduct to an undercover member of law enforcement and during a subsequent interview with agents.
Fan “Frank” Liu, 62, of Long Island, New York, and Matthew Ziburis, 49, of Oyster Bay New York, are charged with conspiring to act as agents of the PRC government. Liu, Ziburis and co-defendant Quiang “Jason” Sun, 40, of the PRC, are charged with conspiring to commit interstate harassment and criminal use of a means of identification. Liu and Sun are charged with conspiring to bribe a federal official in connection with their scheme to obtain the tax returns of a pro-democracy activist residing in the United States. According to the complaint, Liu is president of a purported media company based in New York City, while Ziburis is a former correctional officer for the State of Florida and a bodyguard. Sun is a PRC-based employee of an international technology company. According to the complaint, Liu and Ziburis have been operating under Sun’s direction and control to discredit pro-democracy PRC dissidents residing in the United States – including in New York City, California and Indiana – by spying on them and disseminating negative information about them. For example, at Sun’s direction, Liu paid a private investigator in Queens to bribe an IRS employee to obtain the federal tax returns of one of the dissidents. The private investigator was cooperating with law enforcement, and no Internal Revenue Service employee received a bribe payment. The defendants planned to publicly disclose the dissident’s potential tax liabilities to discredit him. The co-conspirators also made plans to destroy the artwork of a dissident artist whose work is critical of the PRC government, and the artist’s sculpture depicting PRC President Xi Jinping as a coronavirus molecule was demolished in the Spring 2021. Sun has paid both Liu and Ziburis for these efforts to stalk, harass and surveil dissidents residing in the United States. As part of their efforts, the defendants electronically allegedly spied on the pro-democracy activists. For example, posing as an art dealer interested in purchasing the artwork of the dissident artist, Ziburis secretly installed surveillance cameras and GPS devices at a dissident’s workplace and in his car. While in the PRC, Sun watched the live video feed and location data from these devices.

The Daily Wire,"‘Is This A Prank?’: Nancy Pelosi Reads Poem By Bono To Comfort Afflicted Ukrainians, Leaving…",I,"Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) teased on Thursday morning that she would be reading a poem written by Bono for the Ukrainian people at Congress’ annual Friends of St. Patrick luncheon that afternoon. It was seemingly out of the blue and the instant reaction on Twitter was simple: “Why?”

At the luncheon, she read poetry by the lead singer of U2, Bono — who is an Irishman himself. It compared St. Patrick to Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelensky.

Based on tweets, it seems that “Why?” transformed into more of a “What in the world?” The spectacle was truly bizarre.

As flagged by Greg Price, Pelosi told the media Thursday morning, “I will be reading a poem written by Bono about Ukraine which you might find interesting.”

Many people did, but not for the reasons the speaker may have hoped.

Miranda Devine of the New York Post quipped, “Third in line. 81 years old. Unhinged.”


One Twitter user opined, “Good god this is getting worse every single day. The kabuki theater and virtue signaling from hell. Only war escalation and zero efforts toward peace. This country is lost.”


The phrase ‘Kabuki theater’ is a reference to a form of Japanese dramas, featuring heavy acting and elaborate costumes. The bad news for Americans everywhere is that is isn’t fiction. It was real life. There were dozens, if not hundreds, more mocking Pelosi.

Just prior to introducing River Dance at the luncheon, Pelosi read the poem by Bono. To put it in layman’s terms, it was even more cringe-worthy than one would expect.

“I got this message this morning from Bono,” Pelosi said before reading the rhyme. “Most of us — whether we’re in Ireland or here — Bono has been a very Irish part of our lives,” she added.

The full poem can be found here:

Oh Saint Patrick he drove out the snakes; With his prayers but that’s not all it takes; For the snake symbolizes; An evil that rises; And hides in your heart; As it breaks; And the evil has risen my friends; From the darkness that lives in some men; But in sorrow and fear; That’s when saints can appear; To drive out those old snakes once again; And they struggle for us to be free; From the psycho in this human family; Ireland’s sorrow and pain; Is now the Ukraine; And Saint Patrick’s name now Zelenskyy.

In response, The Federalist’s Ben Domenech tweeted something many readers might be wondering at this point, “Is this a prank? Did someone pretend to be Bono and sent her this?”


But it was not a prank at all. Pelosi was serious.

And it’s not the first time Pelosi has offered an off-key attempt to commemorate something.

On January 6, Pelosi invited the cast of the broadway musical “Hamilton” to preform one of its songs and discuss equity.

That was pretty bizarre, but the poem by Bono may have topped it.

Consider this: on Wednesday, Zelensky asked for a no-fly zone and America to come to Ukraine’s assistance. That would have been the start of World War III, so America sent nearly a billion more dollars in aid to Ukraine instead.

But, Pelosi tacking on a poem by Bono likely did not strike strike any fear into the heart of Russian President Vladimir Putin or inspire the Ukrainian people.

It may have done just the opposite.",https://www.dailywire.com/news/is-this-a-prank-nancy-pelosi-reads-poem-by-bono-to-comfort-afflicted-ukrainians-leaving-everybody-bewildered,Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) teased on Thursday morning that she would be reading a poem written by Bono for the Ukrainian people at Congress’ annual Friends of St. Patrick luncheon that afternoon.

The Daily Wire,Jen Psaki MiG-Splains To NBC Reporter In Testy Exchange Over Why Biden Hasn’t Done More For…,I,"White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki gave a condescending reply to NBC Correspondent Kristen Welker when the latter — who had just questioned President Joe Biden about his administration’s refusal to send military planes to Ukraine — pressed her on the same subject.

Welker attended Biden’s Wednesday speech, during which he announced some $800 million more in aid to Ukraine amid the ongoing Russian invasion — and she asked why, despite pressure from both sides of the political aisle, he was not ready to supply MiGs to Ukraine to assist with air defense.

Biden refused to address the question outright. “I’m not going to comment on that right now. I’m not going to comment on anything other than what I have told you today. Thank you,” he said.


Hours later, Welker joined the rest of the press corps for a briefing from Psaki — where she again attempted to get the White House’s reasoning for not sending planes or facilitating the transfer of MiGs that had already been offered by Poland.

“And I want to go back to the MiGs quickly and just be crystal clear about what you’re saying. Because when I asked the president about this earlier, he said he’s not going to comment. He didn’t say that it’s not an option. So —” Welker began.

“Well, we’ve spoken to it approximately 167 times. So, maybe he —” Psaki replied.

“Well, here’s 168,” Welker shot back.

WATCH:


“Go ahead. Go ahead,” Psaki conceded, prompting laughs from the press corps.

“There’s a growing — there’s a growing number of Republicans and Democrats who are supporting the U.S. striking a deal with Poland to send the MiGs. You have Elise Stefanik earlier today saying Ukraine ‘needs those MiGs.’ You have Scalise saying, ‘Getting [those] MiGs in immediately is…critical.’ There’s a growing chorus of voices saying that now is the time,” Welker explained, asking, “Has the president reconsidered his stance at all at this point?”

Psaki pushed back, saying that the military made the assessments with regard to what would be the best and most effective aid to send to Ukraine. She also noted that Ukraine already had a number of “mission-capable aircraft that are not being utilized,” and that the United States did not view sending more to be the highest priority.

“But they don’t think that’s enough, Jen. You heard President Zelensky,” Welker continued.

“This is the assessment by our Defense Department,” Psaki repeated, adding, “They’re also assessing that the transfer to Ukraine may be mistaken as escalatory.”

Psaki concluded by repeating that the Defense Department had come to the conclusion that sending MiGs would not change the overall effectiveness of Ukraine’s air defense, making the risk of escalation not worth taking.

“We certainly understand. We share the passion, the anger, the horror at what we’re seeing. And that is why we are — we significantly increased the types of military assistance, the types of equipment that we know is effective and our Defense Department has determined is effective in fighting this war,” Psaki said.",https://www.dailywire.com/news/jen-psaki-mig-splains-to-nbc-reporter-in-testy-exchange-over-why-biden-hasnt-done-more-for-ukraine,White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki gave a condescending reply to NBC Correspondent Kristen Welker when the latter — who had just questioned President Joe Biden about his administration’s refusal to send military planes to Ukraine — pressed her on the same subject.,2022-03-17
The Daily Wire,‘Jim Harbaugh Might Win The ESPY Award For Courage This Year’: Jason Whitlock Slams Michigan…,I,"On Wednesday, sports columnist Jason Whitlock reacted harshly to the news that Michigan football coach Jim Harbaugh had celebrated his “history-making” decision to add a starting point guard on the Georgetown basketball team as female graduate assistant to his football coaching staff. Whitlock snapped, “American men have taken the role of Dr. Jack Kevorkian. We’re assisting in our own death, undermining our role as leaders, shirking our responsibility to shepherd God’s garden.”

“We’ve embraced the diversity, inclusion, and equity religion favored by women, the LGBTQ+ community, and race idolaters,” he explained. “This carefully constructed coalition of Marxists constitutes the foot soldiers of global elites. They evangelize and communicate through Silicon Valley’s social media apps.”

“The fundamental tenet and organizing principle of D.I.E. (diversity, inclusion and equity) is that Christian men are the bane of society and the obstacle stopping women, the gender-confused, and people of color from realizing their American dream. The goal of D.I.E. is to kill Christian men and dislodge masculine, traditional men from American power,” he asserted. “We, men, are collaborating with our enemies. We pat ourselves on the back and bask in glory every time we weaken our grip on leadership.”

Whitlock said of Harbaugh’s choice, Mimi Bolden-Morris, “Do we think Bolden-Morris’ drive to coach football supersedes the thousands of boys and men who play the game? I’m suspicious. I think her and Harbaugh’s desire to build their individual brands by any means necessary supersedes most people’s. Corporate media is obsessed with forced diversity. Harbaugh and Bolden-Morris are seizing an opportunity to capitalize on the obsession.”

Whitlock pointed out Bolden-Morris said, “It speaks volumes to the efforts that Coach Harbaugh has made to create an environment of inclusion. These opportunities have been an anomaly for a black woman until recently.”

“There it is. The race card,” Whitlock snapped. “Played to ward off criticism of Harbaugh’s publicity stunt. Played so the public is blinded to the real agenda. A college football coach’s job is to mold men, not create an inclusive environment that meets the diversity standards of the D.I.E. religion. “

“There was a time in America in which molding men into leaders was a high priority,” he declared. “That era strengthened America, made us the envy of the world. Now China prioritizes building strong men while we seek to strengthen men who want to be women and women who want to be men. … For the gods of diversity, inclusion, and equity, there’s no more courageous sacrifice than renouncing manhood. The only thing that remotely compares is turning over leadership responsibility to women, particularly the role of developing boys into men.”

He mocked, “Jim Harbaugh might win the ESPY Award for courage this year. Or maybe it will be Apple CEO Tim Cook. This week, Apple released a new series of emojis that included pregnant men. Men can’t get pregnant. Caitlyn Jenner and Tifanny Abreu can have a $100 million in surgery and they’ll still never carry a baby.”

“Despite their best efforts, the gods of D.I.E. cannot overrule God’s design,” he wrote.

He concluded, “Jim Harbaugh, Tim Cook, and Adidas are preaching from the exact same diversity, inclusion, and equity bible as the overwhelming majority of American ministers and Christians, the real doctors of death.”",https://www.dailywire.com/news/jim-harbaugh-might-win-the-espy-award-for-courage-this-year-jason-whitlock-slams-michigan-football-coach-for-picking-female-basketball-player-as-asst,"On Wednesday, sports columnist Jason Whitlock reacted harshly to the news that Michigan football coach Jim Harbaugh had celebrated his “history-making” decision to add a starting point guard on the Georgetown basketball team as female graduate assistant to his football coaching staff.

The Daily Wire,A Columbia University Doctor Was Suspended After A Complimentary Tweet About A Black Woman.…,I,"A top psychiatrist at Columbia University Irving Medical Center commented on a photo of model Nyakim Gatwech, who is of South Sudanese descent, and now the doctor’s been suspended – with students demanding he be fired.

On February 21, psychiatrist Jeffrey Lieberman quote-tweeted an image of Gatwech. The original tweet said that Gatwech was “not a work of art made of black stone or granite.”

The tweeted added, falsely, that Gatwech is “in the Guinness Book of World Records for having the darkest skin ever seen on earth.”

Lieberman quote-tweeted the image and tweet and added: “Whether a work of art or freak of nature she’s a beautiful sight to behold.”

This tweet, which had nothing to do with Lieberman’s job at Columbia, caught the attention of Gatwech, who posted it on her Instagram account. Gatwech underlined the words “a work of” and “or freak of nature,” but did not say she found the phrases offensive. She did, however, take issue with the original tweet’s claim that she was in the Guinness Book of World Records for her skin color.

“It’s time I address a a [sic] rumor ONCE and for all. I have no idea where it originated, but my manager first brought it to my attention in 2020 and although we’ve denied it to multiple fact-checkers, clearly it’s still floating around even after @guinnessworldrecords stated that it does NOT monitor skin tones. I can’t imagine it’s even possible to know who’s the lightest or darkest person on the planet!” Gatwech wrote.


Lieberman’s tweet caught the attention of someone at Columbia, prompting him to send an apology to his peers prior to his suspension. In his email, Lieberman apologized for his “racist and sexist” tweet, The New York Times reported. He also said he was “deeply ashamed” of his “prejudices and stereotypical assumptions.”

“An apology from me to the Black community, to women, and to all of you is not enough,” Lieberman wrote in the email, according to The Times. “I’ve hurt many, and I am beginning to understand the work ahead to make needed personal changes and over time to regain your trust.”

Lieberman was suspended and “removed from his position as psychiatrist-in-chief at Columbia University Irving Medical Center/NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital,” the outlet noted.

That all happened in late February. The College Fix reported that students don’t think Lieberman was punished enough for his tweet, which may have been poorly worded but was clearly meant as a complement to Gatwech. A group of unsigned psychiatry residents and graduates wrote an open letter on March 6 demanding Lieberman be fired as a faculty member, claiming his tweet was just one example of a “pattern of insensitive and offensive behavior.”

The letter claimed his tweet was “clearly racist and sexist” and a “brazen dehumanization of black women.” Further, the residents and graduates claimed Lieberman’s wording “so clearly recall structural violence perpetrated against historically marginalized communities.”

“…His permanent removal is one of many ways we can demonstrate to our community that regardless of status and title, Columbia has zero tolerance and is committed to combatting prejudice and bias in medicine,” the letter said.",https://www.dailywire.com/news/a-columbia-university-doctor-was-suspended-after-a-complimentary-tweet-about-a-black-woman-students-want-him-fired,"This tweet, which had nothing to do with Lieberman’s job at Columbia, caught the attention of Gatwech, who posted it on her Instagram account.

The Daily Wire,White House Slams Hawley Allegations About Biden SCOTUS Nominee’s Lax Record On Child…,I,"The White House is accusing Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of misinforming the public through his allegations that the president’s Supreme Court nominee “has a pattern of letting child porn offenders off the hook for their appalling crimes.”

White House spokesman Andrew Bates said in a Thursday statement that Hawley’s comments were “toxic and weakly-presented misinformation that relies on taking cherry-picked elements of her record out of context.”

“It buckles under the lightest scrutiny,” said Bates, according to Washington Post reporter Seung Min Kim.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Daily Wire.


The Missouri Republican went public Wednesday evening with allegations against Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson in a Twitter thread that expressed concerns that Jackson’s record “endangers our children.”

Hawley warned that as far back as during Jackson’s time in law school, the judge has questioned whether convicts should be made to register as sex offenders and said that it leads to “stigmatization and ostracism.”

“She’s suggested public policy is driven by a ‘climate of fear, hatred & revenge’ against sex offenders,” Hawley said in a Twitter thread.

“It gets worse,” he warned. “As a member of the U.S. Sentencing Commission, Judge Jackson advocated for drastic change in how the law treats sex offenders by eliminating the existing mandatory minimum sentences for child porn.”

And according to Hawley, Jackson has said that some people in possession of child pornography “are in this for either the collection, or the people who are loners and find status in their participation in the community.”

“What community would that be?” he asked. “The community of child exploiters.”

The Missouri Republican further said that Jackson has suggested there may be a type of “less-serious child pornography offender” whose motivation is not sexual, and noted that during Jackson’s time on the U.S. Sentencing Commission, Jackson said she “mistakingly assumed that child pornography offenders are pedophiles.”

The Daily Wire has not independently confirmed the senator’s claims, which come ahead of the Supreme Court nominee’s confirmation hearings next week.

Jackson’s nomination process has been spearheaded by Left-wing judicial activism nonprofits like Demand Justice, an organization flush with cash with a massive 2022 budget.

Demand Justice did not immediately respond to The Daily Wire’s request for comment on Hawley’s allegations.

Filings examined by Axios show that one of Demand Justice’s board members is The Nation justice correspondent Elie Mystal, who recently sparked a backlash by calling the Constitution “kind of trash” on The View.

Demand Justice has refused to weigh in to The Daily Wire on Mystal’s controversial comments, prompting sharp criticism from conservative groups like Judicial Crisis Network and Americans for Public Trust.

“Left-wing dark money groups in the Arabella Advisors network spent a jaw-dropping amount of money in 2020 to help elect Joe Biden and Senate Democrats,” Judicial Crisis Network President Carrie Severino said in a February statement.  “These groups have done everything in their power to corrupt the judiciary and the judicial nominations process, from running smear campaigns against Justices Kavanaugh and Barrett to pushing radical court packing reforms to even intimidating Justice Breyer into retirement.”

“Now that they have a vacancy, they want payback for their dark money spending in the form of a Supreme Court justice who will be a rubber stamp for their unpopular and far-left political agendas.”",https://www.dailywire.com/news/white-house-slams-hawley-allegations-about-biden-scotus-nominees-lax-record-on-child-pornographers-as-toxic-and-weakly-presented-misinformation,The White House is accusing Republican Sen.

The Daily Wire,Russian Journalist Who Stormed Live State-Media Broadcast Says Russians ‘Zombified’ By…,I,"Marina Ovsyannikova, the journalist who went viral after she interrupted a live Russian state-run news program to protest the invasion of Ukraine, spoke with the BBC after she was detained, saying that Russians are “zombified” by propaganda.

“I understand it’s very hard… to find alternative information, but you need to try to look for it,” Ovsyannikova, an editor at the state-run Channel 1, said.

“I was aware that if I went to protest in [Moscow’s] central square I would be arrested like everyone else and thrown into a police van and be put on trial,” Ovsyannikova said. “Half the poster was in Russian, half the poster was in English. I really wanted to show the Western audience that some Russians are against war.”

“I feel of course some responsibility lying on me. I was an ordinary cog in the propaganda machine. Until the very last moment I didn’t think about it too much,” she said.

“There are lots of conspiracy theories building up about me,” she said, on the subject of accusations made against her in Russian media. “That’s why I had to explain to the world what really happened, the fact that I am just a normal Russian woman, but I could not remain on the sidelines.”

Marina Ovsyannikova, the editor at the state broadcaster Channel One who protested against Russian military action in Ukraine during the evening news broadcast at the station late Monday, speaks to the media as she leaves the Ostankinsky District Court after being fined for 30,000 rubles ($280, 247 euros) for breaching protest laws in Moscow on March 15, 2022.

Earlier this week, Ovsyannikova stormed the set of a Channel 1 evening live broadcast with a sign in English reading: “No War.”

The sign also included messages like, “Don’t believe the propaganda” and “you are being lied to,” written in Russian.

According to human rights group OVD-Info, she was subsequently detained and taken into custody by Russian authorities.

“Russia is the aggressor. The responsibility for this aggression lies on the conscience of only one person and this person is Vladimir Putin,” she said in a pre-recorded video. “My father is Ukrainian, my mother is Russian, and they were never enemies.”

“I am ashamed that I allowed [Channel 1] to tell lies from the TV screen. I am ashamed of letting Russian people get zombied,”  Ovsyannikova said. “We just quietly watched this antihuman regime.”

After her protest, the Kremlin dismissed Ovsyannikova as participating in “hooliganism.”

“As far as this woman is concerned, this is hooliganism,” said Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesperson. “The channel and those who are supposed to will get to the bottom of this.”

Ovsyannikova says that she was detained and questioned by police for 14 hours, and was fined 30,000 roubles ($280), adding that authorities are convinced that she was acting on someone else’s behalf.

“Nobody believed it was my personal decision. They suggested it could be conflict at work, relatives who were angry about Ukraine or that I was doing it for Western special services,” she said. “They couldn’t believe that I had so many objections to the government that I could not stay silent.”",https://www.dailywire.com/news/russian-journalist-who-stormed-live-state-media-broadcast-says-russians-zombified-by-propaganda,"Marina Ovsyannikova, the journalist who went viral after she interrupted a live Russian state-run news program to protest the invasion of Ukraine, spoke with the BBC after she was detained, saying that Russians are “zombified” by propaganda.",2022-03-17
The Daily Wire,"‘Biden Was Warned About This’: DeSantis Wrecks POTUS On ‘Bidenflation,’ Predicts More Pain By…",I,"Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis (FL) blasted President Joe Biden this week over general inflation — which DeSantis dubbed as “Bidenflation” — and the rising costs of rent and gas.

Responding to a question about rising rents in Florida, DeSantis said “general inflation is causing” rents to spike, and noted of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) moratorium on evictions.

“The CDC basically had a moratorium, so that people … really didn’t have to pay rent,” he said. “What’s happening is now all the people that own these properties are charging more to make up for what was [lost].”

“Biden was warned about this,” DeSantis slammed. “He was told that this was going to happen and they had to take it all the way to the Supreme Court.”

Last summer, the Supreme Court blocked the Biden administration from enforcing its eviction moratorium ordered by the CDC.

“Then you also have the issue where there’s a lot of demand,” DeSantis said.

The governor noted that people from across the nation are moving to Florida because they’re “fed up” with liberal policies. “This is kind of the center of the universe right now,” he said.

DeSantis highlighted massive spending bills heightening inflation, too.

“We warned about this inflation last year. They came in and did the massive spending; the Fed has printed trillions and trillions of dollars, the biggest increase in the money supple that we’ve seen in quite some time. Of course you’re going to have inflation when that happens.”

“That’s what’s happened, and I don’t see it ebbing anytime soon,” DeSantis predicated. “I think this is likely to be something that we’re going to have to contend with.”

The Republican said the way to provide Americans relief from these rising prices is to “reverse” a lot of federal policies, which he said the Biden administration has “not shown an inclination to do.”

“Make no mistake about it, what you need to do is reverse those policies that are causing the inflation to begin with,” he told the press.

“Why are we not producing more energy here in the United States?” he queried, adding that we need more pipelines, natural gas, and permits for drilling.

Speaking of ANWR (Arctic National Wildlife Refuge), Alaska, DeSantis said “there’s more oil and gas up there than in Saudi Arabia. It’s a massive, massive opportunity and basically from the time Biden’s come in, he said, ‘No, no, no.'”

“Well, of course that’s going to cause [inflation], and it’s not just fuel prices,” the Republican explained. “When energy prices are going up the way they are, that permeates the entire economy. It’s more [expensive] to transport … goods … everything is permeated by that, and it helps contribute to rising prices.”

“Let’s do what we can at the federal level to reverse some of the policies that have caused this,” DeSantis said. “And let’s try to give people relief throughout our economy, and if they did that it would make a really significant difference.  But they have not shown an inclination to do that.”

The Daily Wire,Mom Speaks Out In Explosive Video Over Trans Swimmer Lia Thomas: ‘A Full-Grown Male’ ‘Taking’…,I,"A mother of a female swimmer in the Ivy League spoke out in an explosive video condemning those in charge for allowing a transgender swimmer, who is biologically male, to compete against females.

The mother, who says her daughter has personally competed against Lia Thomas, complained that a “full-grown male” is now being allowed to “take” from female competitors and break their hard-earned records. She also claimed her daughter and other biologically female swimmers were warned by higher-ups not to speak about the transgender issue.

“Holy cow, we’re going to talk about a male swimmer — a full-grown male — attempting to take down female icon records, and taking a spot on an Ivy team from one of the Penn swimmers, who have rightfully deserved it,” she told Independent Women’s Forum, according to the Post Millennial. “And we’re talking about, this person’s gonna swim on every relay going forward at championship meets, is going to take the position of a woman on a travel team, is going to take a space in every finals.”

Girls are “frightened” to speak out about the inequality after they were warned to keep their mouths shut, the mother explained.

“And they’re frightened,” the woman said, her voice shaking with emotion. “They’re frightened of losing friends. They’re frightened of being kicked off their teams. They’re frightened of being told by their universities that they’re transphobic and hateful.”

Independent Women’s Forum identified the woman as “Margaret,” captioning the video: “Margaret’s* daughter is a swimmer in the Ivy League who’s been forced to compete all season against XY athlete Will ‘Lia’ Thomas. Thomas — who competed for three years on the University of Pennsylvania Men’s Swim Team — has dominated women’s collegiate swimming competitions this season and broken numerous female legacy records.”

“The NCAA, USA Swimming, the Ivy League, and University of Pennsylvania have all turned their backs on female athletes,” the group said. “When biological males are allowed to swim on women’s teams, female athletes lose. They lose opportunities to win and to compete. And… they lose self-confidence. Dividing athletes by biological sex gives women the chance to compete and win.”

The mother said she fears for her daughter but felt she needed to speak out about the injustice.

“I don’t want my daughter to have any repercussions based upon my desire to speak out for sex-based rights and representation for women,” she said. “She deserves to have a college experience unmarred by this issue, and she deserves to have the time and ability to process what’s going on with her in her own way.”

“At the end of the day, I hope that the IOC, the NCAA, and governing bodies of sport all recognize that women are women,” the woman closed. “We can’t shrug off our sex. Men are men, they can’t shrug off their sex, and women’s sports is protected for females.”

CNN,"Buy this, not that: Pro tips to save at the grocery store",I,"New York (CNN Business)You're probably not too happy with your grocery bills these days. But there are strategies to help you shop without breaking the bank.

Food prices rose 1% in February, the largest monthly increase since April 2020. Over the past 12 months, overall food prices increased 7.9%, the biggest jump since July 1981. Grocery store prices rose at an even faster clip.
Every food item tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics was more expensive last month than it was a year ago. Meat, eggs and soup prices have the widest gap from last year, jumping by double-digits through February.
""When it comes to saving money on groceries, consumers have many options, but it does require making changes to our routines and some savvy decision making,"" said Carman Allison at NielsenIQ.
Here are some penny-pinching tactics recommended by the pros.
Make a shopping list
Grocery stores are well trained in the science of stimulating your taste buds.
The best way to avoid impulsive buys that add to your grocery bill? Make a list beforehand of what you're there buy — and stick to it. Don't get distracted by all those desserts and snacks that aren't on your list.
Planning ahead and shopping with a list help keep you focused on what you need and reduces time browsing around, where temptations can take hold.
Be deliberate at the store and don't add extra stuff to your cart while you wait in the checkout line, where stores tend to put hard-to-resist sweets and other eye-catching items.
Shop around
Finding the best deals means shopping around and comparing prices on products at different stores. One might have better prices on eggs, but another might be cheaper for fish.
""I do not have allegiance to any one supermarket. If you've got the best price, you're my best friend at that moment,"" said Edgar Dworsky, a former assistant attorney general in Massachusetts and founder of Consumer World, an education resource.
But don't just compare prices among the same types of stores. Supermarkets, big box outlets, wholesale clubs, discount grocers and dollar store chains all have different prices and promotion strategies. Check out co-ops and farmers' markets too.
""People can save a lot of money if they know how these stores are set up,"" said Victor Martino, the founder of grocery consulting firm Third Wave Strategies. He recommends shopping at at least two different store formats.
Look for promotions and deals
Stores put out weekly advertisements for sale items in print and online.
Find out when a store releases those offers. Many put out their circular ads on Wednesdays, so that's often the best day to find deals. Check them out and compare.
If there's a great deal, consider stocking up on the product.
""When apple juice is 99 cents a gallon, I will buy a case or two,"" Dworsky said.
And to make sure you're actually getting a good deal, take a look at the price history of products on websites such as CamelCamelCamel.
Use a store loyalty card
Most supermarkets offer free loyalty cards with special deals and savings for members. Some grocers' loyalty cards also offer savings on gas.
Use them.
If you're not using a loyalty card, ""you're throwing money away,"" Dworsky said. ""It's absolutely crazy.""
Switch to store brands
Stores' private-label brands used to be considered cheap knockoffs. But grocers have spent a lot of time and money in recent years improving their products.
House brands are often produced by the same manufacturers that make the big-name items, but they're typically cheaper. Switching to a private label alternative can save shoppers anywhere from 10% to 40%, according to David Bishop, a partner at grocery consulting firm Brick Meets Click.
Experts consider Costco's Kirkland Signature to be one of the top private-label brands. Other store brands include Great Value from Walmart, Simple Truth from Kroger and Good & Gather from Target.
Beware of 'shrinkflation'
Less cereal in the box. Smaller snack sizes. Ice cream gone missing in a container.
You're not losing your mind. You are actually paying the same price or more these days for everyday items but running through them more quickly because their sizes have shrunk.
The reason? A sneaky tactic known as ""shrinkflation,"" deployed by consumer product brands and grocery stores. The phenomenon has been going on for decades, but it typically becomes more common when companies' costs go up, such as during the inflation surge we are seeing today.
There's a way to beat shrinkflation though, say experts: Compare unit pricing — the price per ounce or per 100-count — on similar products to see which is the better deal.
Buy frozen meat and veggies
Meat has seen some of the sharpest price increases during the pandemic.
In February, meat prices rose 14% from a year ago. Chicken was right behind, up 13%.
""Frozen chicken breasts are good quality, can be defrosted one at a time and the savings are significant,"" said David D'Arezzo, a former chief merchant at Dollar General and an executive at pharmacy and supermarket chains.
Frozen vegetables are also a good option, he said. They don't go bad or spoil like fresh vegetables, a hit to your wallet.
Another tip for buying veggies: Buy them at peak season. If you buy tomatoes or other produce when they're off season, you're likely to pay more.
""If you shop seasonally, you can save 25% to 30%,"" said Martino of Third Wave Strategies.
Look for ugly produce
Look at the day-old produce racks or produce outlets in your area to save.
There are also ""ugly"" produce sellers online such as Imperfect Foods and Misfits Market that buy and resell quality fruit and vegetables that grocery stores have rejected at steep discounts.
""Why not pay half price for slightly-dinged produce?"" Dworsky said.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/22/business/grocery-store-prices-saving-money-inflation/index.html,"Here are some penny-pinching tactics recommended by the pros.
Make a shopping list
Shop around
Look for promotions and deals
Use a store loyalty card

CNN,27 pet products we've tried and absolutely love,I,"Like plenty of people, we’re wild about our pets. So much so that when we try a pet product that does what it’s supposed to — and our pets are just as obsessed with it as we are — we can’t shut up about it.

So, wanna know the best pet products we’ve tried and tested with our pets? Ahead, our favorite cat toys, dog treats and more.

All for Paws Interactive Flutter Bug Cat Butterfly Toy
$19.99 $17.99 with 10% off coupon at Amazon
All for Paws Interactive Flutter Bug Cat Butterfly Toy
All for Paws Interactive Flutter Bug Cat Butterfly Toy
Chelsea Stone/CNN
Beyond a shadow of a doubt, this is the best toy I’ve ever bought for Phoebe. The spinning butterfly keeps her entertained for hours — and allows me to get work done without a cat sitting on my keyboard or begging for pets. The only downside: Watching her try to catch the butterfly is so downright adorable, I have trouble staying focused on said work! (We’re also stocked up on replacement butterflies for when the wings inevitably get torn off.) — Chelsea Stone, senior commerce editor

Ruffwear Quinzee Dog Jacket
$74.95 at Amazon
Ruffwear Quinzee Dog Jacket
Ruffwear Quinzee Dog Jacket
Kai Burkhardt/CNN
Miso has a very thin coat and gets cold easily, so we got this insulated jacket from Ruffwear to keep her warm on our morning walks and when we go camping. It’s lightweight, packable and has clips on both sides so you don’t have to awkwardly pick up your dog’s legs to take it on and off. — Kai Burkhardt, associate editor

Roverlund Out-of-Office Pet Carrier
From $149 at Amazon and Roverlund
Roverlund Out-of-Office Pet Carrier
Roverlund Out-of-Office Pet Carrier
Stephanie Griffin/CNN
I’ve struggled to find a stylish yet functional pet carrier that Teddy comfortably fits in — until now. Made with mountaineering-grade fabrics, this tough-as-nails Roverlund carrier fits up to 25 pounds (he is 21 pounds) and features storage pockets, a fleece-lined bed, openings for him to pop his head in and out and rope shoulder straps, making it super easy for me to carry around the airport, along with any other baggage I have with me. I love that this carrier also doubles as an everyday travel bag or a mobile dog bed next time we hit the road. And while I personally love the black and neon yellow, there are plenty of other color combos to choose from. — Stephanie Griffin, senior digital content strategist

EveryYay Gray Patched Pillowtop Lounger Orthopedic Dog Bed

EveryYay Grey Patched Pillowtop Lounger Orthopedic Dog Bed

Katelyn Gendron/CNN
My golden doodle, Maggie, turned 10 on Valentine’s Day, which means she’s a bit of a lovable old maid who needs a bed with orthopedic support for her hips and knees. The EveryYay Gray Patched Pillowtop Lounger Orthopedic Dog Bed from Petco has been a game changer for Maggie’s comfort and ensures that she can sleep comfortably throughout the night. — Katelyn Gendron, SEO manager

Pet Qwerks Dog Squeak Hedgehog

Pet Qwerks Dog Squeak Hedgehog

Mike Andronico/CNN
No matter how many toys I buy Marie, she always goes back to her hedgehogs — particularly this round Pet Qwerks model I got for her birthday last year. She loves to chew on this plush’s giant nose, and its small, spherical design is perfect for her little Frenchie mouth. It also lets out an amusingly creepy laugh when you squeeze it, which is very fitting for my small monster. — Mike Andronico, senior tech writer

Fable Pets The Game
$55 at Fable
Fable Pets The Game
Fable Pets The Game
Stephanie Griffin/CNN
This slow feeder from Fable Pets has been a staple in my household since day one. I personally love it because it keeps Teddy fed, obviously, but it also keeps him entertained for up to 30 minutes — meaning I can actually do work or chores without being bothered. It also can hold up to 1.5 cups of dry food and is dishwasher-friendly, which was initially a huge selling point for me. It sits pretty on our floor, and now Teddy tells us when he’s hungry by hitting The Game! — Stephanie Griffin, senior digital content strategist

Wild One Puppy Poo Kit
$32 $30 at Wild One

Wild One Puppy Poo Kit
Hayley Saltzman/CNN
These poop bags are the best ones I’ve tried. They have a slightly less slippery feel, which makes them much easier to open and use than some of the other ones I’ve tried. The best part, however, is the twist-top poop bag carrier, which attaches to my dog’s leash and ensures I’m never caught without a poop bag on a walk. It’s super easy to refill, plus it’s cute! — Hayley Saltzman, head of social

Catit Senses 2.0 Flower Fountain
$38.99 $27.99 at Amazon

Catit Senses 2.0 Flower Fountain
Tobey Grumet/CNN
The best part about having a cat as a pet is that you can leave them alone for a day or two without worrying (too much). Yeah, I love my cat, but she’s cool with some alone time once in a while. And though I still feel a bit guilty heading out, at least I know this flower-shaped cat fountain will give her access to filtered drinking water while we’re away. Simple to clean and put together, you’ll need to fill it only about once or twice a week and change the filter about once a month. Plus, it won’t annoy you when you’re home because it runs extremely quietly. — Tobey Grumet, contributing editor

Little Beast The Super Duper Reversible Parka Vest
$88 at Little Beast
Little Beast Co The Super Duper Reversible Parka Vest
Little Beast The Super Duper Reversible Parka Vest
Stephanie Griffin/CNN
Teddy is a diva and is undoubtedly very, very, VERY particular when it comes to pet clothing. So as you might expect, I was thrilled when he first strolled around in his adorable new parka vest from Little Beast without trying to rip it off within the first five seconds of having it on. Both lightweight and warm, this parka vest is reversible and features Velcro attachments, which makes it extremely easy to take on and off. Teddy rocks a size large, and I am still waiting for Little Beast to come out with the adult version so we can match! — Stephanie Griffin, senior digital content strategist

PetFusion Ultimate Cat Scratcher Lounge
From $49.95 at Amazon
PetFusion Ultimate Cat Scratcher Lounge
PetFusion Ultimate Cat Scratcher Lounge
CNN/Chelsea Stone
There has never been a happier feline than my beloved cat, Phoebe, splayed out on this PetFusion Ultimate Cat Scratcher Lounge. Not only is the lounge’s loopy shape aesthetically pleasing, but it also provides the perfect indentation for Phoebe to nestle into while she takes her morning (and afternoon, and evening) naps and does her daily patrol of the windowsill. Plus, the lounge doubles as a scratcher, which is great news for my couch. She clearly loves it, and I, her doting mom, love how much she loves it. — Chelsea Stone, commerce editor

Kong Stuff A Ball Dog Toy
$15.99 $13.99 at Chewy
Kong Stuff-A-Ball Dog Toy
Kong Stuff A Ball Dog Toy
Kai Burkhardt/CNN
Miso has a very active mind but is a destructive chewer, so there are only a few toys she can really go to town on that won’t fall apart. We fill this ball with treats and she chews away for hours trying to get them out. After months of abuse, it still looks as good as new. — Kai Burkhardt, associate editor

Katelyn Gendron/CNN
Maggie loves “jewelry,” and by jewelry I mean sweaters, collars and bandanas. You ask her if she wants to put on her “jewelry” and she begins to wag her tail in excitement and lets out a gentle bark. This nine-piece holiday bandana set on Amazon ensures that almost every month Maggie has new “jewelry” to wear throughout the year. — Katelyn Gendron, SEO manager

Casper Memory Foam Dog Bed
$199 $169.15 at Casper
Casper Memory Foam Dog Bed
Casper Memory Foam Dog Bed
Stephanie Griffin/CNN
This is yet another pet product I’ve had since the day we brought Teddy home. I love this dog bed from Casper because it’s two layers of cushiony memory foam, making it the perfect cozy surface for our pup to sleep on all day and night. It’s super easy to clean, thanks to the removable cover (which can be thrown into the washing machine!), and it’s available in three neutral colors and three different sizes. Out of the three beds Teddy has, this is hands down his favorite! — Stephanie Griffin, senior digital content strategist

Litter Genie Ultimate Cat Litter Disposal System
$20.99 at Target
Litter Genie Ultimate Cat Litter Disposal System
Litter Genie Ultimate Cat Litter Disposal System
Lindsey Smith/CNN
I recently bought a Litter Genie for my cat, and it’s the best pet purchase I’ve ever made. It’s basically a Diaper Genie but for cats and completely masks the smell of her waste. We also can’t live without the Paws & Pals brush and Burt’s Bees Dander Reducing Spray for soft and clean fur. — Lindsey Smith, associate editor

Nina Ottosson by Outward Hound Brick Puzzle Game Dog Toy
$24.99 $14.95 at Amazon
Nina Ottosson by Outward Hound Brick Puzzle Game Dog Toy
Nina Ottosson by Outward Hound Brick Puzzle Game Dog Toy
Kai Burkhardt/CNN
We’ve tried giving Miso various puzzle toys since we rescued her because she’s super intelligent and needs to let out a lot of mental energy every day. This one is her favorite, but she’s starting to do it too fast, so we might need to try the next level up soon. In this puzzle, you hide treats in sliding bricks and your dog has to either open the lid of a brick, take it out or slide them all around to reveal their reward. — Kai Burkhardt, associate editor

Whimzees Dental Treats
$38.99 $34.77 at Amazon
Whimzees Dental Treats
Whimzees Dental Treats
Mike Andronico/CNN
Maintaining Marie’s oral hygiene has become crucial as she gets older, and given the fact that she’s kind of a maniac, brushing her teeth isn’t exactly easy. Fortunately, Whimzees’ dental treats give me an easy way to keep her bad breath at bay. These chews last a lot longer than other brands I’ve tried and, just as importantly, help keep her occupied when I’m trying to get work done at home. — Mike Andronico, senior tech writer

Tuft + Paw Stellar Cat Bed
$299 at Tuft + Paw
Tuft + Paw Stellar Cat Bed
Tuft + Paw Stellar Cat Bed
Rachel Lubitz/CNN
Any cat owner knows that the quest to find a stylish cat bed is a long and tiring one. Most look like little fuzzy houses made of plaid or bright florals, and in my tiny studio apartment — for which I’ve handpicked everything to have a certain modern and midcentury yet eclectic vibe — that simply won’t do.

So imagine my glee upon finding this cat oasis that looked straight out of West Elm. For starters, my cat loves the thing. For several hours a day you can find her nestled inside the orb (as I like to call it), with her tiny body a mere black blob on the soft fur cushion inside. Sure, it took her a day to get used to the thing, but nothing that a few sprinkles of catnip couldn’t fix. It honestly brings me so much joy looking at it. There is simply no going back. — Rachel Lubitz, lifestyle editor

West & Willow Custom Pet Portrait
From $65 at West & Willow
West & Willow Custom Pet Portrait
West & Willow Custom Pet Portrait
Stephanie Griffin/CNN
I’m “that” dog mom who has a literal shrine of her pet throughout her home — and my shrine wouldn’t be complete without this custom pet portrait from one of my favorite pet brands, West & Willow. It’s hanging front and center in my home, and it couldn’t have been easier to order! All you have to do is pick how many pets you want in your photo (you can have up to three), choose a photo and select the size, background and frame color. Every pet parent needs one! — Stephanie Griffin, senior digital content strategist

Ruffwear Highlands Dog Sleeping Bag
From $99.95 at REI
Ruffwear Highlands Dog Sleeping Bag
Ruffwear Highlands Dog Sleeping Bag
Kai Burkhardt/CNN
We use this sleeping bag whenever we go camping with Miso, but we also keep it out in the house so she has an extra place to lie down and relax. It’s kept her warm on chilly nights in the woods, plus it packs down super small and is even machine-washable. — Kai Burkhardt, associate editor

Wild One Travel Carrier
$125 at Wild One
Wild One Travel Carrier
Wild One Travel Carrier
Chelsea Stone/CNN
Taking my cat, Phoebe, on a cross-country flight back home is always a recipe for stress — on my part. (Phoebe is usually fine.) My most recent trip with her was no different: We were delayed for five hours, but the Wild One Travel Carrier ended up being a major lifesaver. While we were stranded in the terminal, I was able to unzip the carrier into a covered cat bed with a comfy cushion to give her room to stretch out and get some air (the interior leash clip came in super handy; I could give her a little freedom to wander without worrying she’d run away). Plus, the plentiful pockets — including the cell phone pocket — made my life easier when it came to keeping her necessities like treats and wipes on hand, while the sleeve fit over my luggage handle to ensure she was secure as I wheeled her along during the journey. — Chelsea Stone, senior commerce editor

West Paw Qwizl Tough Treat-Dispensing Dog Chew Toy
$18.95 From $18.92 at Chewy
West Paw Qwizl Tough Treat Dispensing Dog Chew Toy
West Paw Qwizl Tough Treat-Dispensing Dog Chew Toy
Kai Burkhardt/CNN
Miso loves this enrichment toy because it’s even harder to get treats out of than the Kong Stuff A Ball. We shove treats inside or even put a bully stick all the way through and she’ll chew and gnaw until we take it away from her or all the snacks are gone. — Kai Burkhardt, associate editor

Tuft + Paw Vista Perch

Tuft + Paw Vista Perch
Chelsea Stone/CNN
My cat, Phoebe, loves to shadow me while I go about my day, which most of the time is adorable. When I have to work, however, it’s an issue. She especially loves to hop onto my desk and plop herself right between me and my screen in a not-so-subtle plea for attention. In an effort to reclaim my desk space and satisfy my daughter’s need to be involved in my every task, I installed this fluffy yet sleek cat perch from Tuft + Paw on the wall alongside my desk — it didn’t take long and came with easy-to-understand instructions. The Vista allows my feline overlord to comfortably lounge while she supervises my workday, and it’s not an eyesore for me to look at ether. — Chelsea Stone, senior editor

Yeti Trailhead Dog Bed

Yeti Trailhead Dog Bed
Kai Burkhardt/CNN
This bed is pricey, but it’s an absolute dream. It’s ultra plush and supportive, giving Miso a comfortable place to lie wherever we put it. Plus, its interior cushion is removable, so we use it as a bed in her crate and leave the exterior section out around the house so she always has two beds to relax in. — Kai Burkhardt, associate editor

Kalimdor Dog Water Bottle
From $10.99 at Amazon
Kalimdor Dog Water Bottle 
Kalimdor Dog Water Bottle
Stephanie Griffin/CNN
At this point, I think I have convinced all of our neighbors, friends and literally everyone at our local dog park to buy this water bottle — it’s just that good. First of all, I love it because it holds 19 ounces of water and is leakproof, so I never have to worry about spills in my bag, and it also “re-collects” any remaining water so we never waste a drop. If you frequently go to the dog park, you like to hike with your pet or you’re planning on embarking on a long drive, you need this! — Stephanie Griffin, senior digital content strategist

My cat is incredibly spoiled. Not only does she have Tuft + Paw’s Stellar Cat Bed, but now she gets to comfortably lounge on this Sherpa cat cushion. After a day of getting used to it, she now curls up in this adorable pouf for at least five hours a day. She looks quite cute in it too. — Rachel Lubitz, lifestyle editor

Little Beast The Love Sweater
Kai Burkhardt/CNN
Little Beast has insanely adorable clothes for small and medium dogs (Miso weighs 40 pounds and wears the XL), and we just had to get this one for Valentine’s Day this year. My favorite part of Little Beast sweaters are the little sleeves, because it makes Miso look like she’s a little kid wearing pajamas. — Kai Burkhardt, associate editor

Chelsea Stone/CNN
Phoebe is a rare animal that loves being brushed, and she especially loves the very scritchy bristles on this Hertzko brush. Meanwhile, I love how effectively it removes her shedding fur, and how easy it is to clean — you just retract the bristles and throw out the fur clump that remains. — Chelsea Stone, senior commerce editor",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/21/cnn-underscored/editors-favorite-pet-products/index.html?iid=CNNUnderscoredHPcontainer,"So, wanna know the best pet products we’ve tried and tested with our pets?

CNN,"27 skin care products you should use, according to dermatologists",I,"This article is a part of CNN Underscored’s Guide to Sleep, a weeklong focus on everything you need to sleep better. We’ll be featuring new products and exclusive deals all week, so check in every morning to see what’s new and be sure to subscribe to the CNN Underscored newsletter to see it all.

The classic fairy-tale character Sleeping Beauty may be fictional, but the idea of beauty sleep is not. According to New York City-based dermatologist Dr. Hadley King, “Getting little sleep has been shown to negatively affect the skin’s appearance.” She explains that this may be because of the stress hormone cortisol, which has been shown to break down collagen. Lack of sleep stresses the body and “the higher the stress level, the more cortisol is produced, and over time the skin’s ability to rebuild collagen and elastin will decrease,” she says. Beyond this, she notes that sleep is critical for the healing and repair of damaged tissues, skin and mind and body health.

Essentially, poor sleep results in more noticeable signs of aging due to a chain of events that leads to the body’s inability to rebalance its hydration. Your skin becomes more susceptible to puffiness, dryness and more visible wrinkles. “Nighttime is when your skin repairs itself,” says New York City-based dermatologist Dr. Morgan Rabach. “More blood flows to your skin at night, collagen increases and DNA repair helps repair cells that were affected by stressors during that day.”

So, as our experts describe, if you want the most of your precious beauty sleep, it’s important to reduce stress and cultivate a bedtime beauty routine that can promote the repair of damaged tissues and improve the moisture balance of the skin. “One way to think about it is to protect during the day (sun protection, antioxidants, moisturizer) and repair during the night (retinoids, growth factors, peptides, moisturizer),” says King.

Rabach recommends incorporating antioxidants and retinols into your nightly skin routine. King says that retinol in particular works to increase collagen and pore size and help dead skin turnover.

With all of this in mind, we’ve rounded up some skin care products that you should add to your routine to tackle your skin care concerns overnight. From makeup removers to overnight mask treatments, check out these dermatologist-approved picks to make the most out of your beauty rest.

Makeup removers
Bioderma Sensibio H20 Micellar Water
$14.99 $11.24 at Amazon
Bioderma Sensibio H20 Micellar Water

If you wear makeup, it’s really important to remove it properly before starting your nighttime skin care routine, according to these dermatologists. Just soak a cotton pad with this oil-free micellar water that’s an editor favorite to quickly remove makeup and dirt. Once your skin is dry, proceed with the rest of your routine with ease.

Versed Day Dissolve Cleansing Balm

Tata Harper
This gentle AHA mask is fragrance- and gluten-free, so it’s safe for even the most sensitive skin. Dermatologist-tested and hypoallergenic, the formula delicately refines the complexion and nixes dullness while simultaneously hydrating with glycerine. Because of its exfoliating properties, it’s best to apply at night to avoid sensitizing the skin, and always remember to use SPF to protect your new baby-soft face the next day.

It’s formulated with allantoin, collagen and nutrient-rich cactus extract to hydrate, repair and replenish the skin before bed.

Serums

$60 at Sephora
Olehenriksen Glow Cycle Retin-ALT Power Serum
Olehenriksen Glow Cycle Retin-ALT Power Serum

For a nighttime retinol-like serum, the Ole Henriksen Glow Cycle Power Serum is a good choice. However, this uses bakuchiol, which is a plant-based retinol alternative, to fight signs of aging. Reviewers love its lightweight, silky texture and how it made their skin glow like never before.

Estée Lauder Advanced Night Repair Synchronized Multi-Recovery Complex

The Estée Lauder Advanced Night Repair is well loved to reduce signs of aging overnight. Formulated with hyaluronic acid, it’s known to smooth fine lines and reveal more radiant, even-toned skin over time. If you can believe it, one reviewer even said they’d use it until they die.

Neutrogena Hydro Boost Night Pressed Face Serum With Hyaluronic Acid

Reviewers of the Isdin K-Ox Under-Eye Cream say this is great for eliminating dark circles under the eye. It’s dermatologist-approved too. Rabach recommends this for your bedtime beauty routine.

We love First Aid Beauty because it works gently on skin. Not only does this eye cream contain retinol, but it also includes hyaluronic acid and the brand’s skin saver complex (a combination of ingredients like colloidal oatmeal, allantoin, aloe and ceramides) to hydrate, calm and soothe even sensitive skin while fighting signs of aging.

Moisturizers
Murad Retinol Youth Renewal Night Cream
$84 at Dermstore
Murad Retinol Youth Renewal Night Cream
Murad Retinol Youth Renewal Night Cream

A sleeping facial like this one by Korres sounds dreamy. “With a delicious fragrance and rich texture, this product contains a stabilized form of vitamin C to help diminish discolorations, brighten the complexion and protect the skin from free radicals,” says King. The formula also includes wild rose oil, which reduces redness and works to plump the skin by morning.

Versed The Shortcut Overnight Facial Peel

Versed The Shortcut Overnight Facial Peel
Versed The Shortcut Overnight Facial Peel
Versed Skin
Versed calls this “the shortcut to glowier skin.” It’s a leave-on exfoliating mask that uses a blend of lactic acid, glycolic acid and vitamin A to break down dead skin and brighten your appearance overnight. However, King doesn’t recommend combining retinols with acids, so use this on a night when you aren’t using any retinol products.

Fresh Black Tea Firming Overnight Mask
$94 at Sephora

If you’d prefer an overnight mask that’s super gentle, the Fresh Black Tea Firming Mask is intensely moisturizing without any harsh ingredients. Rich in antioxidants from black tea, blackberry leaf and lychee seed extract, this can help improve skin elasticity and suppleness.

Jenny Patinkin’s Rose on Rose Face Roller is made of rose quartz to help reduce inflammation and boost circulation, especially after refrigeration.

“A humidifier in the bedroom overnight in dry weather is helpful for decreasing the amount of transepidermal water loss,” says King. This basically means that a humidifier like this one, which we named as the best humidifier for bedrooms, helps prevent too much water passively evaporating through the skin barrier. TLDR: You want to surge your skin with as much moisture as possible while you sleep.

According to King, most of us have deeper wrinkles on the side of the face we sleep on. Although shocking, this makes total sense. Grab yourself a set of these satin pillowcases (which are a much more budget-friendly alternative to popular silk pillowcases) to prevent sleep creases because the soft material is less likely to crease your skin.

However, King does advise that “the effectiveness of silk for this purpose has not been proven.” Better safe than sorry! Rabach recommends washing your pillowcases twice a week, especially if you have oily or acne-prone skin.

CNN,The science behind Zelensky's PR playbook,I,"(CNN)Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is trying to prove there's truth in the old expression, 'the pen is mightier than the sword.' Or in his case -- the selfie video is mightier than the Russian fighter jet.

There's no doubt Ukraine's military is outmatched; it is the David to Russia's Goliath. And yet Zelensky is wielding a modern-day slingshot in the form of social media tools and modern communication skills that are helping him gain an upper hand in what is also a crucial battle: the struggle to control the narrative of war.
Influencing people's perception depends on messages that are simple, memorable and impactful. In Zelensky's communication -- ranging from Twitter posts to media interviews and video addresses to foreign parliaments -- he has checked all three of those boxes. This messaging, in addition to powerfully persuasive optics, will guarantee Zelensky's words have a place in future history books.
Though right now, Zelensky is likely less concerned with his legacy and more focused on keeping his citizens alive. It's one thing to arm your soldiers with advanced weaponry -- the importance of which is unquestioned. But it's a gifted leader's responsibility to arm their people with something equally powerful: inspiration, motivation and national pride.

Zelensky appears to be outdueling his Kremlin counterpart in that regard, if intelligence reports citing low morale among Russian troops are true. Indeed retired US military experts have expressed shock over how poorly-trained the Russian soldiers appear to be, while marveling at how determined and spirited the Ukranians are.
That imbalance of fighting spirit could be costly to the Russians, if you subscribe to the theory of legendary Second World War General George S. Patton, who said, ""Wars may be fought with weapons, but they are won by men. It is the spirit of men who follow and of the man who leads that gains the victory.""
Channeling his inner Winston Churchill during a House of Commons address earlier this month, Zelensky echoed a line from the former British Prime Minister, vowing to fight the Russians ""in the forest, in the fields, on the shores, in the streets."" Churchill used these very lines to lift the spirits and resolve of a war-weary Britain during the darkest hours of the Second World War, when England was believed to be the next Nazi conquest.
But the Ukrainian President isn't just repurposing lines from the past. He's also crafting memorable sound bites that seem to rise above the rest of the noise. For instance, his warning to invading Russian soldiers was meant to underscore that Ukranians are not quitters: ""When you attack us, you will see our faces, not our backs.""
This is just one of several powerful oratory techniques Zelensky has frequently employed: using your words to help audiences visualize a successful outcome. Like Churchill, Zelensky declared to British lawmakers, ""We will not give up, we will not lose."" The Ukrainian president demonstrated a full appreciation for the power of positive thinking, to get buy-in from an entire nation that your campaign is winnable.
There is scientific evidence to back this up. Neuroscientific research has shown a single word has the power to regulate physical and emotional responses. Positive thoughts and words stimulate specific brain activity that moves people into action. Zelensky seems determined to have his words prompt his people -- and many more across the globe -- into the kind of action that could save his country.
Like Franklin Roosevelt, Martin Luther King Jr. and other great orators in history, Zelensky's calls to action use metaphor and powerful imagery, some of which have moved western politicians to tears during his recent speeches.

During these parliamentary addresses, Zelensky tailors his message to the particular group he's trying to persuade. For instance, when addressing US lawmakers, he conjured up imagery of Mount Rushmore and evoked Martin Luther King, Jr's, ""I Have a Dream"" speech, in stating ""I have a need."" For good measure, he cited both Pearl Harbor and the 9/11 attacks to heighten his audience's ability to feel his country's pain. Likewise, to the British Parliament, he quoted Churchill and Shakespeare. And to the Germans, Zelensky made references to the post-Holocaust phrase, ""Never again.""
Zelensky has gained the narrative upper hand not just with words, but with optics. The visuals of the two opposing leaders are riddled with contrasts. Zelensky physically stands with his people on the darkened streets of Kyiv in a fatigue-green T-shirt and military-style jacket. He embodies the image of a courageous and defiant rebel who appears as one with the soldiers he's sending into battle.
Putin, on the other hand, is dressed like a politician, isolated at the end of an enormous conference table, or alone in a TV studio recording a taped message. Zelensky's selfie videos are gritty, modern and real. Putin's appear staged and dated.
Perhaps Putin's realization that this stark contrast did not favor him, prompted him to hold a pro-war rally in a crowded stadium (attendance was reportedly mandatory for state employees) to show he had support from the Russian people. But even then, his choice of a puffy, down coat made him look more like a malevolent Michelin Man than an omnipotent leader to be feared.
Putin tried to tear a page out of Zelensky's modern communications playbook by ditching the suit and getting out among the people. But the feeble attempt proved that you can't teach an old bear new tricks. To make matters worse, even the televised feed of Putin's speech abruptly cut out in mid-sentence, due to what was called ""technical difficulties.""
History is kind to the brave and courageous, especially when they defy odds that are stacked against them. Zelensky, through his fearless calls to action, is defining his legacy more and more with each passing day, while Putin's exposed weaknesses run counter to the reputation of strength he's worked hard to propagate.
It's difficult to say to what degree Zelensky's gifted communication skills are responsible for the surprising strength of the Ukrainian resistance. But if Churchill's thesis on the power of oratory is correct, then history is likely to assign outsized credit to the role Zelensky's words have played.

As Churchill wrote: ""Of all the talents bestowed upon men, none is so precious as the gift of oratory. He who enjoys it, wields a power more durable than that of a great king."" Or in this case, a dictator.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/21/opinions/zelensky-wartime-speech-communications-pr-mcgowan-silva/index.html,"There's no doubt Ukraine's military is outmatched; it is the David to Russia's Goliath.

CNN,What GOP gets wrong about FL's 'don't say gay' bill,I,"(CNN)Being a Republican is becoming harder and harder. From conspiracy theories about stolen elections to being urged by a former colleague in the Trump administration to ""repent my gay sins,"" I continue to find it harder and harder to relate to the so-called ""party of life.""

As one of the few openly gay officials in Trump's administration, and a lifelong Republican, I've struggled with how to reconcile my differences on LGBTQ+ issues with the political right. I agree with Republicans on most fiscal issues. But, as to how the party treats the LGBTQ+ community, their policies continue to cross the line.

Case in point: Florida Republican lawmakers' recent passage of the controversial ""Parental Rights in Education"" bill.
Dubbed the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill, the legislation bans public schools from teaching students about sexual orientation or gender identity in kindergarten through third grade. Despite not explicitly saying ""don't say gay,"" its language, requiring that lessons for older students only be taught in ""age appropriate or developmentally appropriate"" terms, is argued to be deliberately ambiguous. What's more, this criteria is a mechanism for prohibiting open discussions of LGBTQ+ people, families and issues.
Proponents of this bill, and of the 15 other bills similar in nature being considered in nine states across the country, routinely claim school districts and educators are infringing on parental rights and ""sexualizing school aged children,"" and argue such conversations should be led by parents rather than educators.
These claims, at face value, aren't entirely invalid. Parents absolutely should play an important role in having these conversations with their children.
However, despite the important role parents play, it is blatantly wrong and hypocritical of Republicans to assert that legislation is needed to help protect America's youth from so-called ""sexualization"" in our public schools.
In fact, the reality is, whether it be love stories between male and female characters in assigned readings, or lesson plans that teach foreign languages through illustrations of traditional households, students are exposed to hetero-sexualism each and every day. Republicans aren't outraged by this and bills aren't being introduced to strip classrooms of these materials.
Instead, the Republican claim of protecting children is nothing more than a guise to distract the public while far-right Republicans accomplish their true objective of restricting conversations around homo-sexualism and other sexual orientations and gender identities to which they object.

Further, as a byproduct of their asinine policies, far-right Republicans also claim that discussions of LGBTQ+ related topics don't belong in the classroom. From book bans to disbanding gay-straight alliance clubs, these very actions and ideals are ludicrous and discriminatory.
America's classrooms are important spaces where topics such as civil rights and social studies are taught. Members of the LGBTQ+ community have played important roles in both American and international history, and LGBTQ+ students equally deserve to see their own history and experiences reflected in their learning environment.
Whether it be learning about the Stonewall riots in New York in 1969 or Obergefell v. Hodges, which resulted in the Supreme Court ruling in favor of same-sex marriage nationwide, these students should be afforded the opportunity to learn alongside their peers in an environment where they can be proud of who they are. Students across the country shouldn't learn in an environment where they feel as if their mere existence or the discussion of their sexual or gender identity is somehow criminal by nature.
Finally, schools are supposed to be a place where we send our children to be educated and prepared for the real world. If that truly is the case, and we're serious about educating world class leaders, cleansing academic environments of LGBTQ+ related materials and mentions isn't preparing our youth for that charge.
At the end of the day, this isn't a winning strategy for Republicans either. These pieces of legislation are blatantly discriminatory and wrong on all accounts, as evidenced by a recent Gallup poll.
In fact, support for LGBTQ+ people and their rights has reached an all-time high among Republicans. Specifically, Gallup found that 55% of individuals who identify as a Republican support same-sex marriage. This is the highest level of Republican support for same-sex marriage recorded since Gallup began measuring this sentiment in 1997.

Let's be real; contrary to the claims of far-right Republican lawmakers, there isn't some mass conspiracy of teachers trying to ""groom"" students into being gay. Being gay isn't a choice and Republicans know that.
Instead, this whole charade is nothing more than another attempt by far-right Republicans to fuel a political divide at the expense of yet another marginalized community, all while pushing an antiquated political agenda.
And for that reason, as a proud member of the LGBTQ+ community, I urge my fellow Republicans to stand up, show respect for every American, and stop legislating asinine policies for problems that simply do not exist.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/21/opinions/republican-colleagues-get-florida-dont-say-gay-smith/index.html,"Case in point: Florida Republican lawmakers' recent passage of the controversial ""Parental Rights in Education"" bill.

CNN,What Ketanji Brown Jackson's hearing reveals,I,"(CNN)CNN Opinion contributors share their tweets on the first day of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's Supreme Court confirmation hearing.

Watching #KetanjiBrownJackson confirmation hearing for the #SupremeCourt feels surreal. It's not anything I ever imagined I'd see in my lifetime--Not because there aren't many qualified Black women for the court, but because sexism & racism work so hard to diminish our dreams.

— RoxanneJones (@iamroxannejones) March 21, 2022
Even a few minutes into her opening statement, Judge Jackson already is displaying qualities and a personal story that will make her a difficult person to demonize.

GOP Judge Tom Griffiths introducing #JudgeKetanjiBrownJackson gives her bipartisan cred. Her endorsement by @GLFOP (Fraternal Order of Police) negates potential attacks on crime. And her opening statement is personal, patriotic, powerful. Impressive first day so far.

Breaktime on #KetanjiBrownJackson hearings

My quick take so far:

Republicans spent more time on Kavanaugh and Thomas than #KBJ (note there will be no beer ?s)

Democrats sing #KBJ praises, linking her legacy to #RBG, Motley (confident this will be her 4th confirmation)

— Professor Renee Knake Jefferson (@reneeknake) March 21, 2022
Hawley goes right into his accusations that Jackson is ""soft on child pornographers,"" a Pizzagate/QAnon dogwhistle (and a sign of how much those conspiracies are seeping into the GOP).

— Nicole Hemmer (@pastpunditry) March 21, 2022
Sen Sasse also complaining about Kavanaugh and other R hearings and says that SCOTUS reaches beyond its constitutional purpose, but is more even-handed in blaming a broader problem involving all three branches and both parties going back decades. He's one of the reasonable ones.

— Jennifer Rodgers (@JenGRodgers) March 21, 2022
If KBJ is going to be held accountable for statements made by outside groups supporting the nomination, every Senator should be confronted with statements made by donors, and asked if they agree.

Starting with any Senators who have received donations from January 6 protestors

Nice to see Democrats embracing Judge Jackson's prior experience as a public defender. Blumenthal's discussion of the role of public defenders from a prosecutor's perspective (""my greatest fear as a prosecutor was seeing defendants representing themselves"") is key here.

— Democracy is in Trouble 💚💕 (@ProfTolson) March 21, 2022
Sen Cruz gives a false history lesson: it's the Dems fault that SCOTUS is now political. Effectively admits that it's about politics, but the Ds started it. Cruz hold the distinction of saying the most juvenile things with the most adult words of anyone in the Republican Party.

.@SenTedCruz, the first of the '24 hopefuls to speak, makes the most nakedly partisan opening remarks- enough red meat that Lipator may be needed. Multiple shots at @JoeBiden; Ted Kennedy & Ds. Invocations of Bork; Thomas & Kavanaugh hearings; guns, abortion & softies on bench!

— David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) March 21, 2022
Klobuchar points out, Judge Jackson's parents once attended segregated schools and became school teachers. #KetanjiBrownJackson more than knows the definition of humble beginnings, despite criticism that she's too elite as a double Harvard grad. (The one time it's a problem btw)

— Natasha S. Alford (@NatashaSAlford) March 21, 2022
Ah, now Sen. Lee is getting to the point. After lots of philosophy, and even a little Greek mythology, Lee brings it around to the legitimacy of the court and therefore .... court packing. Lee hasn't raised an issue about her experience, but expect questions to her about this.

I hope this doesn't need to be said, but I'll say it anyway (as a longtime prosecutor): Any person who zealously represents criminal defendants does a vital constitutional duty. Such service is crucial to our democracy and a credit to any lawyer's record.

CNN,What's next for the batsuit?,I,"When costume designer Glyn Dillon got a call asking if he'd be interested in working on Matt Reeves' newly-released movie ""The Batman,"" the first thing he sketched was a pair of ears. ""How big are the ears?"" he remembered worrying about. ""For some reason, it's a big deal with all the fans,"" he said over Zoom.
From Adam West and Michael Keaton to George Clooney and Christian Bale -- and now Robert Pattinson -- each version of the Caped Crusader becomes the measure for a new generation of viewers. But perhaps nothing cements the reputation of Batman more than his batsuit.

There was the now-infamous nipple-clad muscle number signed off by director Joel Schumacher for ""Batman Forever"" (1995) and ""Batman & Robin"" (1997), the misshapen mask and demonically out-turned ears in the 1943 television serial or the extra-bulky batsuit Ben Affleck wore in Zack Snyder's 2016 version. Yet despite every modification, failed and successful, the historic costume still holds an undeniable kind of power. ""As soon as you put on the suit,"" Pattinson told GQ magazine in the run-up to the film's release, ""it sort of does something to you. You start behaving in this quite particular way.""

And the story of this batsuit already stands apart from the rest, due to an unwavering focus on realism. It's the handiwork of Glyn Dillon and Dave Crossman -- longtime colleagues that have worked together on Star Wars movies ""Rogue One"" (2016) and ""Solo"" (2018) -- as well as acclaimed costume designer Jacqueline Durran -- who won an Oscar for her work outfitting the cast of ""Little Women"" (2019).

""The Batman"" director Matt Reeves envisioned a more realistic batsuit. Credit: Warner Bros.
""This is the most based-in-reality the Batsuit can be,"" said Crossman on the same call, ""we removed a lot of the fantasy element.""
Inspired by Martin Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"" (1976), and borrowing heavily from the film noir genre, director Matt Reeves was keen to forge a more realistic version of damaged millionaire Bruce Wayne for his film. Still marred by the murder of both his parents, a young Wayne is grappling with his new life as a masked vigilante in Gotham City -- fighting organized crime and villain The Riddler.
His suit is built in tandem with this tale: An angry, inexperienced outsider trying to right the wrongs of the world himself. Homespun and amateurish, this Batsuit is covered in visible topstitching and exposed zippers. ""We wanted it to feel real,"" said Dillon. ""That was one of the things we were thinking about. Like, 'well if you really had (the batsuit) you would have a fly and you'd be able to put it on quite easily.'""
batsuit legacy tbm topstich

The ballistic-looking bodysuit is modeled after both the texture and movement of a bullet proof vest, along with a cop-inspired utility belt. ""It definitely looks like he's nicked stuff from the police department,"" chuckled Dillon. In the true style of Travis Bickle, Scorsese's psychologically disturbed protagonist, Wayne even fashions a pair of quick-draw gun holsters to hide in his wrist.

Even the cowl, Batman's signature molded mask, imitates the appearance of leather panels hand-stitched together. ""No one's ever done that kind of thing before,"" Dillon noted, of its DIY-feel. Its surface is flecked with bullet grazes and indents, telling a story of previous close calls, said Crossman.
The sculpted, furrowed brow typical of earlier masks has been replaced with a more neutral expression, too, helping Batman blend in better when moonlighting as a detective. It's cut sharply just under the cheekbones, Crossman points out, much like the original comic book depictions. ""And we couldn't cover up his jaw,"" interjects Dillon. ""(Pattinson's) got an amazing jaw.""

Inherited traits
As unique as this batsuit might be, no man is an island -- and no version of Batman is created in a vacuum. Operating within a franchise that has over 80 years worth of material to draw from was both a help and a hindrance, according to Dillon and Crossman.
Research, however, was straightforward enough: ""He's such an iconic character, you just know about the usual gear. It was more a case of 'What did we like?'"" Dillon recalled. They decided to recreate the gray of Adam West's 1960's batsuit, a color which reappeared later in Frank Miller's 1987 landmark comic story arc ""Batman: Year One,"" (another key text for Reeves).
""You've got the gray suit and the black cape,"" said Crossman. ""So you have this nice contrast between the two things. He's not another black blob.""

Crossman and Dillon have also reintroduced the iconic yellow accent, a feature that has been missing since 1997's ""Batman & Robin,"" albeit subtly. ""We have this tiny, tiny, little bit of webbing on the sleeve, with a bit of yellow on there,"" Dillon explained. ""It's nice to bring it back.""
But the enormity of the franchise, and its fanbase, sometimes felt overwhelming -- where considering the fans could quickly become ""paralyzing,"" Dillon admitted.
""There's too many opposing factions,"" he continued. ""People are married to the idea that (one subjective portrayal) is the only true Batman.""
The evolution of the batsuit
Since the very first Batman story appeared in a 1939 issue of ""Detective Comics,"" the suit has evolved from a camp and colorful garb into something distinctly militaristic. ""The batsuit itself has definitely become more intricate,"" said comic book author and Batman chronicler, Matthew K. Manning, over video call. ""Now, the suit is more like a piece of armor all pieced together. When (in older adaptations) it was really just tights.""
Larger production budgets and better access to more sophisticated materials has of course impacted the costume's trajectory, according to Crossman. ""Some of it is led by what you can actually achieve at the time,"" he said. ""If you look at the earliest (cinematic) Batman, you can see the fabric is sagging, but by the time Adam West comes along, fabrics are slightly improving.
""Tim Burton's 1989 film version was the first to create a contoured cowl for Michael Keaton; using black foam latex instead of the ill-fitting spandex or high-sheen satin used in previous films. ""As time goes on, all these techniques get better. Especially with computer work,"" said Crossman. ""Now, you can model things on the computer so you can make them a lot more wearable and enable your head to move.""
batsuit legacy Michael Keaton 1989

While the days of a lycra-clad Batman feel long gone, Manning believes audiences still deserve a higher dose of fantasy on their screens."" (Filmmakers) really can't get away from armor (muscle suit) for the mass audience,"" he said. ""There is an obsession with making things utilitarian. I don't know if (the industry) just doesn't trust modern audiences with fantasy. That said, I haven't seen fans as excited for a Batman movie since Christopher Nolan. So they might be going in the right direction here.""

About 'Top Gun: Maverick'

Paramount
Tom Cruise returns more than 30 years later to reprise his most famous role as Maverick in the new Top Gun sequel. We wouldn't care except... This is a Tom Cruise movie and the action sequences alone will be worth the price of admission. Hopefully. The trailer provides glimpses. Maverick is still flying as the movie begins, and he's assigned a new group to train that includes his old friend Goose's son, Rooster (Teller). Expect a monster box office performance for this one, and familiar faces, old and new.

We don't have any real details on M:I7 aside from the fact Christopher McQuarrie will return to write and direct as he's done in the last two (and best) installments. This franchise is all about oneupmanship stuntwise. Expect Cruise to top the last film, Fallout, when he went skydiving from the upper stratosphere.

Dr. Strange (Cumberbatch) opens the door to the multiverse and unleashes a bizarro version of himself who becomes all-powerful. Wanda Maximoff will appear to lend a hand but she may not be enough.

Warner Bros.
It'll be a big year for the DC Extended Universe with both Flash and Aquaman movies on the way. The Flash will put Ezra Miller's Barry Allen front and center in a story that sees the metahuman travel back in time to stop his mother's murder. The decision costs him in the present, however.

The Flash will also feature old friends Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne and Michael Shannon as General Zod, who was killed by Superman in Man of Steel. Both will probably appear in the past. The movie will also introduce Sasha Calle as Supergirl, Superman's cousin. We'll see how she fits into the overall Justice League scheme, but it's cool to see the Universe expanding.

About 'Disenchanted'

Disney
In 2007, Enchanted became a surprise hit. The live-action/animated musical fantasy romantic comedy combined many genres to create a crowd-pleasing story full of all the great stuff from fairy tales with some modern flourishes.

Disenchanted, the Enchanted sequel, has been in the works for over a decade. Disney just couldn't get the story right, despite multiple screenwriters. Reportedly, it was the work of Brigitte Hales, the newest writer on the project, that got the sequel greenlit after 14 years. It'll premiere on Disney+ in 2022. Here's the story synopsis, per the DisInsider:

""The film will see Giselle, Robert, and Morgan moving to a new house in the suburbs, overseen by Malvina Monroe, the main villain of the film. After problems begin to arise, Giselle makes a wish to transform their lives into a perfect fairytale. However, the spell backfires dramatically and puts Giselle in a rush against the clock to save both her family and her Kingdom of Andalasia before the clock strikes midnight.""

Legally Blonde 3 has a tentative release date of May 2022, but there's no way that'll happen. Mindy Kaling is co-writing the script and has not finished, as of December 2021. But things seem positive for this long-gestating project. Legally Blonde was released in 2001 so Elle Woods has real staying power. It should be fun catching up with her 20 years later, especially with Kaling as a writer. Reese Witherspoon talked about the story with Entertainment Tonight recently, ""It's a lot of me and this lady (Jennifer Coolidge), that's all I have to say.""

About 'Pinocchio'

Netflix
As you may be aware, the original Italian story, Pinocchio, by Carlo Collodi, is a dark little affair. Disney's version is quite different, but a new 2022 adaptation will hew closer to the original. That's because it's helmed by Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth, The Shape of Water), master of spooky fairy tales. Expect a fantastical ride — the film will be a stop-motion musical (Del Toro's first animated movie). There's plenty of reason to be intrigued, including an all-star voice cast. Ewan McGregor will handle Jiminy Cricket.

About 'Death on the Nile'

20th Century Studios
Director Kenneth Branagh's second (Murder on the Orient Express) adaptation of an Agatha Christie mystery in recent years, Death on the Nile should deliver the expected twists and turns. It certainly has an impressive cast. Branagh will play uber-Detective Hercule Poirot once again as he tries to solve the murder of an heiress while on a Nile River cruise.

Yahoo,Sluggish computer? Here's some expert advice to get it back on the fast track,I,"The spinning rainbow wheel of death is one of the more frustrating sights in our modern world. Sure, you can refer to it as a beach ball if you’re feeling lighthearted. Or you can call that computer-freezing icon what it really is: the bane of your existence.

A slow computer that takes forever to load web pages, open documents, and respond to pretty much any basic command is more common than you think. It’s often just a matter of poor maintenance or disorganization. Powerful tune-up software like System Mechanic will get rid of all the excessive, unnecessary files and other junk clogging up your PC, jumpstarting its performance and boosting your internet speed.

System Mechanic addresses up to 30,000 potential problems, running hundreds of critical tests to stop your device from slowing down and crashing. The ultra-private software uses military-grade wiping to make sure things like deleted data and cached web pages are gone from PCs forever, freeing up tons of hard drive space.

Try System Mechanic for 30 days free, then $4.99 a month

If system clogging is not the culprit, though, it could mean your PC or Mac is running a malicious program that you’re unaware of.

“Keeping your computer up to date doesn’t just improve your online experience; it can also make attacks from malware, viruses, and scammers more obvious,” says Adam Levin, cyber security expert and founder of CyberScout. “If your computer is always glitchy or running slow, it’s not always obvious whether it’s a newly installed malicious program or a more innocuous problem.”

Ready to get your computer back on the fast track? Below are four common culprits for a sluggish computer, plus the software and maintenance solutions that can have you up and running smoothly in no time.

The issue: Too many startup programs
The solution: Remove and disable unnecessary programs

An abundance of unnecessary startup programs is one of the most common reasons your computer is so slow, and can tack on up to 10 minutes of boot-up time from the moment you switch on your device, according to Techlicious. As those programs continue to run in the background, they further impede your computer’s speed.

Try cleaning up your computer automatically—and in one fell swoop—by installing System Mechanic, the leading solution for decluttering your digital world on PCs. It’ll address all the junk that’s slowing down your PC or Mac, and restore its good working order in no time. System Mechanic offers a free 30-day trial; after that, it’s just $4.99 a month.

Here’s how to clean up your computer manually, if you want to get a headstart now: Edit down your default startup programs by first trashing unnecessary desktop icons, then organizing the rest in desktop folders. If you’re using a Mac, navigate to Login Items, then uncheck the programs you don’t need. If you’re on a PC using Windows 8 and above, go to the Startup tab, right-click on the programs you want to remove, and hit Disable.

If you’re using Windows 7 or older, navigate to the Startup tab, then uncheck all the programs you don’t need to run whenever you start your computer. Note that antivirus and antimalware programs should always be included in startup programs; the rest are up to your discretion.

Ransomware Malware Attack. Business Computer Hacked. Security Breach

The issue: Malware
The solution: Install Malwarebytes Premium anti-malware software
Malware is shorthand for malicious programs that make their way into your computer and wreak havoc, allowing hackers access to sensitive personal information that could lead to identity theft.

“Keep your computer clean by always running some type of end-point protection. These often include email scanning, anti-virus, anti-malware, and personal firewall applications to help protect your computer from slowing down and putting your information at risk,” says Ron Culler, Senior Director of Technology and Solutions for ADT Cybersecurity, to Yahoo Life. “Using what [your computer] comes with doesn’t always work, and there are many affordable solutions that often give you the ability to run it on multiple computers in your home.”

Malwarebytes Premium is the leading software for detecting existing and emerging security threats thanks to 24/7 smart technology. Not only will it remove any existing malware in your computer, but it’s constantly on the lookout for malicious program infiltrations, blocking them before they even have a chance of striking. Protect up to three Macs or PCs with one Malwarebytes subscription, and reduce your worries about malware slowing down your computer—or worse, exposing sensitive information to predators.

Practicing common sense will keep you safe, too. “Pay attention to what you click on when reading emails or browsing the web. It’s very easy to infect your computer with malware or ransomware by clicking links in unsolicited emails or links in social media” says Culler. “You never really know what is at the other end of that enticing link.”

The issue: Your software that is out-of-date.
The solution: Turn on automatic updates
Blame it on your laziness: If you’re often ignoring prompts to update your computer’s software, you’re probably hindering its ability to run smoothly. Even worse, you’re all but inviting malware into your system. “Updates are issued when vulnerabilities are found,” says Levin. Some updates pertain to new features, “but many of these features relate to security issues that have been discovered or new ways to better protect you.”

“Any time you get a legitimate notice to update your software, don’t click ‘I’ll do it later,’” advises Levin. That being said, he warns never to follow a link from an email to perform a so-called software update; this is most likely a phishing scam. Only perform updates based on actual, legitimate prompts on your computer sent directly from the programs you have installed.

Having Malwarebytes Premium running in the background at all times lets you double-down on the protection, in the off chance you accidentally slip up and click on a malicious link. Malwarebytes can help thwart the threat in real life, stepping in when human error occurs.

The naked eye can't see just how much junk is stored on your computer's hard drive. (Photo: Getty)
The issue: Your hard drive is a mess
The solution: Clean it up—and “defrag” it
Consider your hard drive the storage room of your computer. It’s where everything is kept for the short and long term, from your operating system to anything you’ve ever downloaded from the internet. Your hard drive only has so much space, and when it gets clogged and cluttered, it borrows “mental” energy to sort through things, slowing down its performance when called upon to do other things like load a web page.

If your computer’s running on Windows, run a disk cleanup by selecting Disk Cleanup in your Start menu. Then select the files you’re okay with deleting, including those already in your Recycle bin. You’ll also want to “defrag” your hard drive. The hard drive stores everything in sequential order, but over time, files can get disorganized, leaving defragmented holes and random information scattered everywhere. A tool like Defraggler by CCleaner can do the work for you.",https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/how-to-speed-up-slow-computer-155343563.html,"

The Penny Hoarder,"If You Have $1,000 in the Bank, Make These 6 Moves",I,"You’ve done it. You’ve built up a little cushion in your bank account — $1,000! It feels good, right? Those days of checking your account balance in a panic are behind you.

Congrats! You’re on the right path. Now it’s time to think about some longer-term goals. What do you want to accomplish next with your money? Do you need to save more? Do you want to buy a home someday? Invest?

What’s the next step you should take? What are some specific things you can do to take your finances to the next level?

We’ve got some ideas for you:

1. Invest in Famous Art (Even if You’re Not a Millionaire)
You might be thinking you need at least a few more zeros in your checking account before you can even start thinking about investing in art. Warhol? Monet? Banksy? Yeah right. You just managed to finally put away $1,000. Those guys are way out of your league, right?

Wrong. You could still get started with what you’ve got. Seriously.

A company called Masterworks is helping us average folk invest in multimillion-dollar works of art — traditionally one of the most lucrative investment options that’s only available to the super rich. But you don’t need hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy a masterpiece outright; with Masterworks, you can buy shares, instead.

Here’s why it’s a good option: Fine art is super valuable, so it can potentially earn you more money than the stock market. Over the long term, the stock market will earn you an average annual return of 7%, but Masterworks lets you invest in art that’s historically seen a 10% to 25% price appreciation.

This is a long-term strategy, so patience pays off here — literally. But once your piece of art sells, you get your cut of the profits. 

It takes less than a minute to request an invitation , and you could become a Masterworks member by the end of the day.

2. You Can Cancel Your Car Insurance
Did you know you can save some serious money just by switching car insurance companies?

Its true — rates are at historic lows, and you could be paying way less for the same coverage. All you need to do is look for it.

But don’t waste your time hopping around to different insurance companies. Use a website called EverQuote  to see all your options at once.

EverQuote is the largest online marketplace for insurance in the US, so you’ll get the top options from more than 175 different carriers handed right to you.

Take a couple of minutes to answer some questions  about yourself and your driving record. With this information, EverQuote will be able to give you the top recommendations for car insurance. In just a few minutes, you could save up to $610 a year.

3. Use This Secret Debit Card

Tina Russell/The Penny Hoarder 
Here’s the deal: If you’re not using Aspiration’s debit card, you’re missing out on extra cash. And who doesn’t want extra cash?

Yep. A debit card called Aspiration  gives you up to a 10% back every time you swipe.

Need to buy groceries? Extra cash.

Need to fill up the tank? Bam. Even more extra cash.

This card used to have a huge waiting list, but you’re now eligible to sign up for free.

Enter your email address here , and link your bank account to see how much extra cash you can get with your free Aspiration account. And don’t worry. Your money is FDIC insured and under a military-grade encryption. That’s nerd talk for “this is totally safe.”

4. Get up to $200 in Free Stocks 
Imagine if you had bought one share of Amazon for $18 when the stock first went public. Today, it would be worth more than $20,000 — despite all the ups and downs in the stock market.

Here’s the thing about millionaires: They know the sooner you start investing, the better. And we found a company that will give you free stock to get started.

An investing app called Robinhood  will give you up to $200 worth of free stock in companies like Visa, Microsoft and GE, just for downloading its app and opening a free account.

Robinhood is free and easy to navigate, which is why more than 10 million people use it — including both news junkies looking to outsmart the market and people who want to carefully put a few bucks away in a long-term investment.

It takes just a couple of minutes to sign up  and get your free stock — you may even just get a share of the “next Amazon.”

5. Ask This Website to Help Pay Off Your Credit Cards
No, like… the whole bill. All of it.

While you’re stressing out over your debt, your credit card company is getting rich off those insane interest rates. But a website called Fiona  could help you pay off that bill as soon as tomorrow.

Here’s how it works: Fiona can match you with a low-interest loan you can use to pay off every credit card balance you have. The benefit? You’re left with just one bill to pay every month, and because the interest rate is so much lower, you can get out of debt so much faster. Plus, no credit card payment this month.

Fiona can help you borrow up to $250,000 (no collateral needed) with fixed rates starting at 2.49%.

Fiona won’t make you stand in line or call a bank. And if you’re worried you won’t qualify, it’s free to check online . It takes just two minutes, and it could save you thousands of dollars. Totally worth it.

All that credit card debt — and the anxiety that comes with it — could be gone by tomorrow.",https://partners.thepennyhoarder.com/1000-checking-destkop-prt/?aff_id=9&utm_source=verizon&utm_medium=paidnative&aff_sub3=1000-checking-desktop&vmcid=p%24g%2co%243aa3e2e8-aac7-11ec-b88a-008cfacd5798-7f369bc58700%2ct%241648053319981,"What’s the next step you should take?

Tetty Betty,Goodbye Fixer Upper? What Sent Them To Court,I,"The beloved Windy City Rehab hit headlines once again in 2021 for yet another dispute between its stars, this time concerning co-hosts Donovan Eckhardt and Alison Victoria. Rumors abounded that the two didn’t get on, eventually leading to Eckhardt’s departure.

But after he left, the drama continued as he actually sued the show for defamation, claiming over $2 million in damages for being portrayed as the “bad guy” throughout the second season.

""The broadcasting of the foregoing Season 2 episodes was the most embarrassing, humiliating and traumatic event Donovan and his family ever endured, and damaged Donovan's mental and physical health,” the lawsuit claimed.

Fixer Upper Furniture Fraud
We all dream of being one of the lucky guests on Fixer Upper, receiving a new renovation on our home to make it look super modern and brilliant. But did you know that the gorgeous gifts presented to the clients, are mostly taken away after the cameras stop rolling? That’s right—they don’t get to keep any of the furniture!

Fixer Upper Furniture Fraud

“Our show features real clients with real budgets,” Gaines wrote in a Magnolia post. “The furniture budget is not part of the renovation budget. It’s something some clients add at the end.”

Gaines and Losses
And it’s not just the furniture and parking controversies that have dogged the Gaineses during their years on air with the hit show Fixer Upper. In 2017 Chip Gaines was accused of fraud—by none other than two of his business partners! Richard L. Clark and John L. Lewis sued Gaines for buying out their shares in Magnolia Realty without informing them of his TV plans.

""Chip Gaines conspired to eliminate his business partners—notwithstanding their longstanding friendship—in order to ensure that he alone would profit from Magnolia Realty's association with Fixer Upper,” said the claim.

A Splash of True Colors
The world was shocked when The Color Splash host David Bromstad announced that he was splitting up with his boyfriend Jeffrey Glasko after 11 years. But they were even more astounded when Glasko then reportedly SUED him in court, claiming that he had spent all of their joint savings on his hard-partying lifestyle.

“These salacious claims were made by a desperate person,” Bromstad’s lawyer, William V. Roppolo, said to InTouch. “The allegations are part of a lawsuit that has been dismissed in Mr. Bromstad’s favor with sanctions levied against Jeffrey Glasko.”

Stitcher Upper
Though they are known for fixing up homes on their mega popular show Fixer Upper, a 2017 lawsuit alleged that hosts Chip and Joanna Gaines were more stitcher-uppers! As client Kelly Downs sued them when she claimed that they had deliberately deceived her regarding the neighborhood of the home she bought from them. She said that the area was incredibly rough and hard to live in, and they had known this and purposefully hidden the info.

Stitcher Upper

“There’s been a lot of commotion coming from the bars and the store across the street,” she said to the Waco Tribune-Herald. “It’s been a problem from the beginning.”

Fake-Out Fraternity
We all love the drama and action on the super popular real estate and renovation show Property Brothers, but do you ever wonder how much of this is real? Because many fans and insiders of the show claim that a lot of the reactions and moments are actually mega exaggerated—for example, pretending to be surprised by developments that they actually already knew about.

Fake-Out Fraternity
Screenshot from ""Property Brothers""

“At the end of the day, it has to be interesting television,” Jonathan Scott admitted to the New York Times. “But when we find a load-bearing wall, we are really finding a load-bearing wall.”

Not-So-Great Scott
Real estate superhero brothers Jonathan and Drew Scott from Property Brothers are true American sweethearts, and often regarded as the most beloved hosts of all the wholesome HGTV shows. But off screen, Jonathan Scott was accused of behavior very far from his squeaky-clean on screen persona.

Not-So-Great Scott
Screenshot from ""My Dream Home""

Scott was drinking in a North Dakota bar when a brawl broke out, ending with a bouncer holding him in a headlock! However, later footage showed that Scott was not to blame for the violence, and he actually sued the bouncer for assaulting him.

Splitting Signals
Not only were fans and the media skeptical about the true reasons behind Chip and Joanna Gaines’ decision to have another baby, but many rumors began spreading that the two of them were not really so happy together behind closed doors.

Splitting Signals

In fact, divorce rumors have plagued the couple for many years—are they based in truth? Who knows.

Spin-Off Spec
As well as speculating over the possible demise of their marriage, Chip and Joanna Gaines also had to deal with many whispers and rumors around their future on the show itself.

Spin-Off Spec
Image via @HGTV/Facebook

Because as the Gaineses became celebrities in their own right, many people started to wonder if they would branch out into other high-profile projects. One rumor was that Joanna would leave to start her own cosmetics company.

On Repeat
When you watch episodes of Fixer Upper, it really looks like whatever happens on the show is truly genuine, but the truth is that a lot of it is pretty contrived and artificial.

On Repeat
Screenshots from ""Fixer Upper""

Even when they do show the contestants’ real reactions and their true words, they have often had to repeat the same words several times, to get the right shot while they say it. Hardly authentic!

Wrapping Up
Even though rumors continued to abound that the Gaineses were splitting up, both in a romantic sense and also professional terms, the truth was they were making a sort of split—but only from the show.

Wrapping Up
Image via @HGTV/Facebook

Because the fifth season hit the network, it was announced that it would be the last run for the show. The two of them made the decision together—but it would only lead to more sinister rumors.

Rocky Reasons
As news spread that Chip and Joanna Gaines had confirmed the upcoming fifth season of Fixer Upper would be their last, rumors began to spread too, suggesting that the couple had made this decision due to their marriage being on its last legs.

Rocky Reasons

Even though the Gaineses insisted they were still going strong, many fans were simply not convinced

Money Murmurs
And that wasn’t the only dark and sinister rumor that was spreading around as people speculated about the true reason Chip and Joanna Gaines had decided to end their show.

Money Murmurs
Image via @HGTV/Facebook

It seemed clear to many that the reality TV couple were pretty financially driven, so a lot of people thought that they had quit the show after demanding, and being denied, a big pay rise.

Pens and Patrons,"Rebecca De Mornay Is Almost 65, Here She Is Now",I,"It’s been a couple of years since the 1980’s… okay, it’s been a bit longer than a couple of years. Where did the beloved celebrities of that era end up? Still famous, or obscure and forgotten? Take a look.

Erin Moran
Erin is best known for her portrayal of Joanie Cunningham on Happy Days. Besides for starring in an unsuccessful spin-off of Happy Days, Erin lived a relatively regular life. She had a couple of guest roles here and there until she passed away after being diagnosed with throat cancer.

Todd Bridges
""Whatchu' talkin' about Willis?"" This famous line from Diff'rent Strokes said to Todd Bridges' character. After eight successful seasons, in line with the stereotype about child stars, Todd sadly got involved in substance abuse.

Off screen, Sean stays in shape by participating in Iron Man competitions.

Steven Tyler
In the seventies and eighties, long-haired singer-songwriter Steven Tyler of Aerosmith was a huge rockstar for songs that are still popular today like, ""Dream On,"" and ""Walk This Way.""

Madonna
Madonna is an artist who has somehow remained appealing and popular from the 1980's until today. She re-invents herself from record to record, and somehow doesn't look like she's aging despite being 59 years old currently. Her latest album, Rebel Heart, was released in 2015, and she was able to make millions from touring that album. In 2016, she supported Hilary Clinton, holding a concert in support of her candidacy. Recently, she adopted four-year-old twin sisters from Malawi.

Neil Young
A legend of folk rock, Neil Young had many albums out as a solo artist or as part of major bands like Buffalo Springfield or Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. Politically, Young made music that is entwined in the fabric of United States history like ""Ohio,"" and ""Southern Man,"" which spawned a heated response from Lynyrd Skynyrd. In 2005, he had a brain aneurysm that was luckily treated with no major complications. He announced in 2017 a new album, Hitchhiker, which is a mix of old and new songs.

Kylie Minogue
She's called the Princess Of Pop or the Goddess Of Pop, but she started out as a soap opera star on Neighbours. Her biggest hit, ""Can't Get You Out Of My Head,"" is, according to Yahoo! music, ""the catchiest song ever."" In 2005, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and was thankfully successfully treated, and returned to an acclaimed tour. More recently, she was a judge on The Voice (the UK and Australian versions). In 2017, she announced that she's working on a fourteenth studio album.

Jeremy Miller
From 1985-1992, Jeremy Miller played Ben Seaver on Growing Pains. After starring in the pilot of Ghostwriter, he was booted from the cast, and besides a couple of Growing Pains reunions has not had huge roles. He spent years recovering from an substance addiction, which he attests began at the shockingly young age of 4. However, in 2017, he can boast 4 new films, two which are already in post-production. Perhaps he is on the cusp of a powerful comeback!

Lisa Welchel
Lisa Welchel was a child star who started off her career in The New Mickey Mouse Club, but probably is best known for her almost decade-long role as Blair Warner on The Facts Of Life. She became a devout Christian at age 10, and was devoted enough to release a Christian pop album in 1984. After a long hiatus from the screen, she appeared on Survivor: Philippines and won $100,000 prize money. In 2013, she co-hosted the talk show The Jeff Probst Show.

Katey Sagal
Peg Bundy always had a comeback to Al's snide comments on Married...with Children. She actually had a career singing backup for major stars like Bob Dylan before her TV career. After Married, Sagal played guest roles on shows and was finally cast in 8 Simple Rules, which unfortunately ended with the death of John Ritter.  She recently starred in a main role in her fourth husband's show, Sons Of Anarchy. She revealed recently that she'd had an affair with Kiss' Gene Simmons.

Traci Lords
Traci Lords started her career scandalously: as an adult film actress who was underage (she used fake identification). After the scandal came out, she went legit, and studied acting. She had a major hit in the feature film Cry-Baby (one of many film and TV roles). She also pursued singing, and had a hit single ""Control"" which went double platinum. In 2015, she was on Celebrity Wife Swap. In 2016, she collaborated with a fashion line. This year, she has her directorial debut in The Unquiet Grave.

In the daytime soap opera Search For Tomorrow, Morgan Fairchild played Jennifer Pace for four years, graduating to primetime soap opera Dallas as the original Jenna Wade. She got a nomination for a Golden Globe for her starring role in NBC's Flamingo Road. She is a self-declared science nerd, and is also deeply informed about political issues. It has been said that she knows, ""more about terrorism than 99.9 percent [of] Americans—and most members of Congress."" She tweets to keep her 60,000 followers informed.

Elizabeth McGovern
Due to her stunning performance in 1981's Ragtime, Elizabeth McGovern was nominated for an Oscar. Since then she has worked steadily with big names like Robert DeNiro, Mickey Rourke, and Brad Pitt.

He was most recently in Tyler Perry's The Haves and the Have Nots, and has many new projects coming out this year.

Richard Dean Anderson
Although Anderson started off on General Hospital, he is best recognized as Angus MacGyver from MacGyver. After the success of MacGyver, Anderson starred in a couple of films, but returned to television in 1997 to star in Stargate SG-1, a role that effectively lasted a decade. The last film he starred in was a spinoff movie of the series, called Stargate: Continuum. Now, he mostly focuses on being a single dad to his teenage daughter, as well as helping environmental organizations.

Kelly McGillis
Although she is famous for being Tom Cruise's love interest and flight instructor in Top Gun, Kelly McGillis is farther from being with Cruise than anyone. She came out as a lesbian, but only after two marriages to men and having two kids. The BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated actress is classically trained, and used her skills to act on stage. She is returning to the screen, though. In 2017, she scored a lead role in the thriller Mother of All Secrets.

Margot Kidder
Margot Kidder started her film career in 1968, and worked in various roles opposite stars like Gene Wilder and Robert Redford.

In 2015, she won an Emmy for her work in R.L. Stine's The Haunting Hour.

Neve Campbell
Audiences might have been too occupied with the ghoulish killer character from Scream to remember Neve Campbell, who was the lead female actress in the role. The whole Scream franchise was very profitable, including a fourth installment in 2011. More recently, Neve played a recurring character on the Netflix political hit House Of Cards. Her son Caspian was born in 2012. She is currently in the midst of filming Skyscraper, alongside Dwayne Johnson, which is set for release in 2018.

Felicity Kendal
Playing the upbeat character Barbara Good on BBC's The Good Life brought Felicity Kendal to prominence. However, she came from a theatre family and had her first role on stage as a baby, so Felicity felt that she should return to her roots. She spent the last couple of decades on West End or off-West End stages; most recently, she has been cast in a 2017 revival of Lettice and Lovage. She converted to Judaism, and says she experiences anti-Semitism from people confused about her religious choices.

Lynda Carter
Since the success of Superman, there was a need for a female equivalent character. Wonder Woman was the answer. Lynda Carter is so closely intertwined with her three seasons as Wonder Woman, that she still today is asked about the new Wonder Woman, Gal Gadot (Lynda gives two thumbs up). Carter is also a recording artist and recorded five songs recently for the video game Fallout 4. DC comics is so close to her heart, she was offered and accepted a role in 2017's Supergirl TV show.

She struggled with weight fluctuations and is a compulsive hoarder. In 2012, she was part of a failed pilot called Counter Culture.

Tiffany Darwish
When she was known just by her first name, Tiffany Darwish was a teen icon and singer-songwriter. She was commercially successful, but her later work never lived up to her first album. She posed in Playboy magazine in 2002. Recently, she's been in a string of reality shows, including Celebrity Fit Club, where she lost 28 lbs. In 2014, she appeared as a contestant on Rachael vs. Guy: Celebrity Cook-Off and placed third. Her last album was in 2016, called A Million Miles.

Heather Locklear
Although she had major roles in TV shows T.J. Hooker, Dynasty and Going Places, she is best known for her role as Amanda Woodward on Melrose Place. Since then she has had roles in many TV shows, including Spin City, although most shows she was in lasted only a season or two. Depression and anxiety plague her life, which culminated in an alleged attempt on her own life. In 2016, Locklear appeared in a TV movie and Tyler Perry's Too Close To Home.

Tawny Kitaen
Tawny Kitaen was given the name Julie, but at age 12 decided on her own that she wanted to be called Tawny. She became well known as the girl from multiple Whitesnake music videos.

Multiple legal issues plagued her, including a domestic violence charge, which led to her divorce from MLB player Chuck Finley. She stars in the TV series Moms Anonymous in 2017.

Rebecca De Mornay
In Risky Business, Rebecca De Mornay played Lana, a mischievous working girl who got Tom Cruise's character in trouble while his parents were out of town.

Recently, she starred in a film alongside John Travolta called I Am Wrath, and starred in Netflix's Jessica Jones.

Elle Macpherson

She worked as an actress in various roles, and she hosted Britain and Ireland's Next Top Model. She dated Billy Joel, and was also married multiple times to multi millionaires. She is getting a divorce from her latest millionaire husband, Donald Soffer, this year.

Phoebe Cates
Phoebe Cates is the girl in the red bikini from the unforgettable fantasy scene in Fast Times At Ridgemont High. The scene was nothing compared to her previous, even racier movie, Paradise, where she appeared sans clothing. She made a shift and focused on garnering a younger fan base with Gremlins. She married actor Kevin Kline and they had two kids, one son and one daughter. Cates has not had a movie role since 2001. Now, she operates her own boutique store on Madison Avenue called Blue Tree.

Daryl Hannah

Kennedy Jr., Jackson Browne, and, currently, Neil Young. The environment is extremely important to her; she's been arrested many times at protests.

Olivia Newton-John
Immediately, when you think about Olivia Newton-John, you think about Grease and the classic soundtrack. However, she is a standalone artist as well who has won four Grammys, and is one of the highest selling artists of all time. In 1992, she had breast cancer but luckily recovered. As recently as 2015, she had a hit single, ""You Have To Believe,"" which reached the number one spot on the Billboard Dance Club Song Chart. Sadly, in 2017, her cancer has returned- in her lower back.

Ione Skye

Henry Thomas
Henry Thomas played Elliot from E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial when he was just nine years old. Since then, he had been annoyed with the box that this put him in, as nobody cared about his latest project, just about the 1981 Spielberg hit. It is fair, as he had acted in films like Gangs Of New York alongside Leonardo DiCaprio. In 2017, he is starring in a Netflix movie based on Stephen King's novel Gerald's Game. He eventually came to terms with and embraced his E.T. role.

Danny Pintauro

A 2016 review of an A-ha concert said that Morten lacked stage presence, literally standing behind the other members of the band.

Tracey Gold
Sadly, Tracey Gold is known for her very public battle with anorexia, rather than her role as Carol Seaver on Growing Pains. She first started dieting young, as she was surrounded by Hollywood culture. The writers of the show were ruthless as well, drawing national attention to her teenage weight gain which led her to become even more obsessed with weight loss. At one point, she was a tiny 80 lbs. Luckily she was able to undo the damage to her body and was able to bear children.

Samantha Fox
As a page 3 model, Samantha Fox posed topless from her teenage years, garnering praise as a teen idol.

MSNBC,"I may be wrong, but …' 5 phrases women need to retire in 2022",I,"On a recent morning, I was at a coffee shop and was handing the barista $10 when I barely brushed his wrist. “I’m sorry!” immediately came out of my mouth. My 9-year-old daughter looked up at me with a no-nonsense look and said, “Mom, what do you have to be sorry about?!”

She was right.

But if you’re a woman, perhaps you can relate to my reaction.

You may automatically find yourself saying “I’m sorry” often – if you can’t make it to a meeting, if you can’t accommodate a last-minute request, even if you’re taking a “little too long” to decide on your order at a restaurant.

So what gives? Why does the need to apologize feel like such a default for so many of us?

The root of the answer may very well lie in stereotypes. Many studies have shown that women’s behaviors are often typecast - for example, women are expected to be communal and nurturing, and to avoid being dominant. Not surprisingly, researchers found that when women act out of alignment with those expected behaviors, they are seen less positively by others. These stereotypes often go unspoken and unchecked. And the truth is, we take plenty of cues about them and what’s expected from us, starting at a very young age.

Part of the apology habit may have to do with differences in what constitutes an “offense” in the first place. One comparative study, in Psychological Science, found that while both men and women apologized in equal proportion for what they considered to be offensive behavior, women actually reported committing more offenses than men. This finding suggests that men apologize less frequently than women because they have a higher threshold for what constitutes offensive behavior.

No matter the reason, the problem with over-apologizing is that it can lessen other’s respect for you. Of course, a heartfelt apology is meaningful and necessary at times, but a constant stream of saying sorry is not.

The other issue is that overdoing it with apologies can be self-reinforcing. When we say it enough, it can become a little too believable that in fact we are in other people’s way, that we’re a bother or that we shouldn’t be taking up their time. Another problematic feature of chronic apologizing is that in some cases, it can be fueled more by our own high standards of interactions than the standards of those around us!

In honor of stopping the apologizing madness in my own life, here are five phrases I’m going to purposely retire in 2022 — and some replacements I'll use instead. I hope you'll join me!

Instead of: “I just wanted to share…”

Try: “I want to share…”

The logic: So often, we say “just” to soften up a direct, assertive message. The problem is, it demeans whatever we have to say with it.

Instead of: “I may be wrong, but…""

“Try: “Here’s what I know today…”

The logic: We could all be wrong, at any time, about anything. That doesn’t mean we need to lead with it – it’s better to focus on what you do know.

Instead of: “Sorry to bother you…”

Try: “When you have a moment, I’d like X.”

The logic: You’re not a bother for interacting with colleagues – collaboration is how we accomplish so many things today. Even if you are bothering someone, trust that they’ll let you know a better time or when they can get to your request.

Instead of: “Does that make sense?”

Try: “What are your thoughts/reactions?”

The logic: Rest assured, you do make sense. If people have a question, they’ll let you know. What you can’t know are others’ thoughts and reactions, so ask about that.

Instead of: “I hope that’s OK…”

Try: “Thanks for considering it.”

The logic: You can be consultative without asking other people for permission. Instead of transferring approval to them, ask them to consider your request and thank them.

The less I over-apologize, the better I feel. It’s liberating to shake off the feeling that you’re constantly stepping on someone’s toes. Or that your need for information is inconveniencing people.

The Daily Wire,New Details Emerge About Boeing 737 That Nosedived Into Ground: ‘A Battle For Control’ Of The…,I,"New details emerged on Tuesday about the China Eastern Airlines Boeing 737-800 that was caught on camera crashing vertically into a mountain range earlier this week, which left no known survivors.

“The Boeing 737-800 was knifing through the air at more than 640 miles (966 kilometers) per hour, and at times may have exceeded 700 mph,” Bloomberg News reported. “Sound travels at 761 mph at sea level but slows with altitude as air temperature goes down and is about 663 mph at 35,000 feet.”

Flightradar24 released data from the flight that showed the aircraft was cruising at just over 29,000 feet when it then plunged more than 20,000 feet in less than a minute before later slamming into the mountains of southern China.

The Air Current noted that the fact that Flightradar24 was able to collect data from the flight as it rapidly plunged toward the ground means “the aircraft had electrical power and was able to broadcast tracking telemetry.”

The South China Morning Post, which is owned by the Chinese Alibaba Group, reported that the flight data “depicted a battle for control of China Eastern Airlines flight” as there appears to have been a temporary recovery in altitude followed by a second nosedive that took the plane straight into the ground.

“It was an exceedingly high-energy crash,” said Bob Mann, president of R.W. Mann & Co. consultancy. “It looks like it literally evaporated into a crater. Do the flight data recorder or cockpit voice recorder or quick access recorder — do any survive? I just don’t know the answer.”

The New York Times reported that investigators were still trying to locate the plane’s black boxes, which record flight data and voice recorders.

“The aircraft was severely damaged in this accident, and the investigation is very difficult,” Zhu Tao, the director of aviation safety at the Civil Aviation Administration of China, said. “With the information currently available, it is still impossible to make a clear judgment on the cause of the accident.”

The Times added:

Mr. Zhu confirmed a few details about the trajectory of the plane that had emerged in flight data shared by Flightradar24, a tracking platform, while also describing for the first time how air traffic controllers had tried to contact the plane when they noticed something amiss.

The plane been cruising at about 29,000 feet around 2:17 p.m. on Monday, he said, but a few minutes later, air traffic controllers had noticed that the plane had suddenly lost altitude. He said the controllers immediately called the plane crew, but did not receive a reply after several attempts. By 2:23 p.m., the plane’s radar signal disappeared, he said, and it had crashed.

“It really catches your eye when you see how rapidly the aircraft went from this horizontal flight,” Mike Daniel, a former Federal Aviation Administration accident investigator, said. “On any given investigation, you can’t rule out foul play at the very beginning,” he said. “It was so abrupt that everything needs to be looked at.”

Australian aviation expert Neil Hansford said that he does not believe that the plane crashed due to any kind of technical issue.

“Even with total loss of power, no aircraft plummets to the ground from 20,000 feet in two minutes with an event at 8,000 feet,” Hansford said. “I think aircraft technical failure can be ruled out and it will be an external event … I would get on a Boeing 737-800 in an instant with an Australian carrier, so my suggestion would be it won’t be Boeing or aircraft technical related.”

“It is very unlikely the pilot passed out as the non-flying pilot would have been able to very safely take over the flying and land the aircraft,” he continued. “Likely scenarios include pilot suicide, aircraft mid-air collision with military aircraft (they don’t have transponders like civil aircraft), [flight MU5735] was struck by a missile or an on-board explosion. My tipping is a human-induced event or bought down by rogue missile. Debris looks like MH117 over Ukraine, and the Chinese are providing too much information this time which is uncharacteristic.”

Jeremy’s Razors first ad received high praise across the internet, but Tim Pool, popular podcast host and influential commentator on TimCast.com, lauded The Daily Wire for its efforts and explained brilliantly on his Tuesday podcast why The Daily Wire — and other anti-woke companies and entities — are needed to fight the Left.

“The Daily Wire has issued a rebuttal,” Pool told his audience after relaying the story of how Harry’s ditched The Daily Wire. “After one year, they released ihateharrys.com, which is Jeremy’s Razors, and I got to say the commercial they put out may be one of the funniest commercials I’ve seen.”

That commercial can be seen here:


“They hit the nail on the head with a hammer, and, this is significant. If there’s any one company that is doing the most — or doing a lot — to build culture and push back on far-left wokeness — it’s The Daily Wire,” he continued.

“Not a day goes by that I am not impressed, inspired, and jealous of what they are doing,” Pool added.

“We may end up going and hanging out in Nashville a little bit with the crew from The Daily Wire,” he also teased.

“But The Daily Wire is absolutely fantastic,” Pool continued. “I mean, this is brilliant. This is their website, ‘I Hate Harrys…Stop giving your money to people who hate you. Give it to me instead.’ And there’s god-king Jeremy Boreing with the cut on his face from shaving.”

“So they tell the story breaking down why they’re launching this new product and it’s absolutely hilarious,” Pool continued. “But in this segment, I will talk to you not just about the fact The Daily Wire has created their own razor company, but also how many on the Left are accidentally watching The Daily Wire’s new cultural content and then going, ‘Oh no, what have I done?! I enjoyed Ben Shapiro’s movie?!’”

“This is fascinating. We at Timcast.com are trying to do something relatively similar, maybe slightly different. The Daily Wire knows the power of culture,” he remarked. “Ben Shapiro and the crew there at The Daily Wire, they understand you have to build culture.”

“For the longest time now, for I think several years, they’ve been working towards releasing movies and TV shows, and we’ve been talking to Daily Wire about, you know, making some kind of show or content — I don’t know exactly if it’s anything significant — but you know Ian over at TimCast IRL, he’s got crazy ideas for shows and maybe something will come of this,” the host added.

“But we’re inspired” by Jeremy’s Razors, he added. “You know I watch these Netflix shows, I watch these movies, and the wokeness, it’s just, it’s palpable. Even when it’s a light touch, I’m just like I don’t agree with those values so it comes off just bad, truth be told.”

“We have a similar mindset to a lot of the crew at Daily Wire because we’ve talked about what we can make in terms of services and products. So we have, of course, our own book,” which can be found here.

“Our first book! We have a book, man, we are like 30 employees, we are nowhere near as big as a Daily Wire, but I am inspired by the work they’re doing,” Pool continued before dedicating nearly 30 minutes to the latest and greatest out of The Daily Wire.

The Daily Wire,"Candace Owens Goes Viral With Response To New York Times Reporter’s Email Citing, Yup, The New…",I,"Candace Owens went viral on Monday after she responded to a New York Times reporter with citations from the newspaper after the reporter seemed to suggest Owens was echoing Russian state media when she said Ukraine, a nation widely known for its corruption, is corrupt.

“Received an email from The NYTimes asking for comment regarding me ‘advancing ideas that Ukraine is a corrupt country’—similar to Russian state TV,” Owens told her followers via social media. “I replied informing them that I actually got my ideas from The New York Times, and provided them links to their past articles.”


“Hi there, I’m writing from The New York Times,” an email from the reporter said. “We’re working on a story about Russian messaging that includes some of your comments.”

“We note that you advanced the idea that Ukraine was a corrupt country, which matched comments we’ve seen from Russian state media,” asserted the reporter, whose identity was protected by Owens.

“I’m wondering if you have any context or further comment to add about this corruption,” the email closed.

“I’m very confused by this email,” Owens responded via email, a screengrab shows. “I learned about ‘the idea that Ukraine was a corrupt country’ from The New York Times. You guys have covered the corruption in Ukraine extensively.”

“As just one example, here is a piece from the NYT Editorial Board titled, ‘Ukraine’s Unyielding Corruption,’” the conservative host wrote, linking to the Times piece.

“I educated myself about both the neo-Nazi problem in Ukraine and the unyielding corruption by reading your newspaper, not Russian state media,” she continued. “Is there something specific I said that was different form what you guys have written in the past?”

Owens didn’t stop there; she followed up her email with another email which included five links to mainstream outlets reporting on the corruption in Ukraine. Two of the five links were from the Times. 

“For more good measure, here are some more past articles written from reputable sources over the past few years about the corruption and neo-Nazi problem in Ukraine,” Owens wrote in the email. 

“For clarity, are you now suggesting that what the western media covered extensively over the last few years is now just Russian propaganda?” she queried. “Are you suggesting all of these articles were sponsored by Russia state media?

She also provided screengrabs of left-leaning outlets, including The New York Times, reporting on Ukraine’s well-known problem with corruption via Instagram. Here are just some of them:

The Daily Wire,Conspiracy To Kidnap A Governor: FBI Told Informant To Brand ‘Innocent Man’ As Federal Agent To…,I,"GRAND RAPIDS, MI: FBI handlers told informant Dan Chappel to label an “innocent man” a federal agent to avoid potential detection, an attorney said Tuesday in the trial over a conspiracy to kidnap Michigan Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer.

Chappel worked for the FBI as an informant in 2020 as part of the Bureau’s investigation into the plot to kidnap Whitmer over her COVID-19 policies. Of six men arrested and accused of taking part in the conspiracy, two have pleaded guilty. Brandon Caserta, Barry Croft Jr., Adam Fox, and Daniel Harris are contesting the charge.

Chappel, called to the stand by prosecutors, testified that FBI handlers directed him to accuse another man, identified as Trent, of being a federal agent to divert suspicion from himself. Chappel said that at one point during his work as an informant, he was concerned about being compromised and outed as working with the FBI.

During cross-examination, Caserta’s defense attorney Michael Hills pressed Chappel on the FBI’s reaction to his fears. Hills highlighted that the FBI directed Chappel to tell a group of men the federal government is now accusing of planning a violent plot to kidnap a sitting governor that an “innocent man” was actually an agent.

Chappel said that the FBI made the determination because the man was already mocked as “fed boy” by other militia members because of his “high-dollar” weapons and his propensity for skipping training. Chappel never accused “fed boy” of being a federal agent, nor was Chappel discovered as an informant during the investigation.

Chappel testified on Friday that the accused men agreed to a plan to attack Whitmer’s Elk Rapids cottage, assassinate her security detail, and abduct her to stand trial in a “kangaroo court” in Wisconsin. Attorneys for the four defendants argue that their clients were entrapped by federal agents into the scheme.

Croft attorney Joshua Blanchard suggested in his opening statement that FBI informants inappropriately obtained evidence because they were being compensated by the federal government. During his chance to cross-examine Chappel, Blanchard pointed to the former informant’s own compensation.

Chappel confirmed that he was paid about $54,000 in compensations and reimbursements for his work as an FBI informant. His job as a contract truck driver for the Postal Service earns him $55,000-$60,000 a year, he said. Chappel noted that he stopped working for about 4 months while he was an informant in 2020.

Blanchard brought out a receipt showing that Chappel had requested and received reimbursements from the FBI for a roughly $3,400 Microsoft Surface Book laptop, $190 laptop docking station, $20 mouse, and an $85 Surface Pen. Chappel also spent, and was reimbursed, about $205 for an extended warranty on the laptop. Blanchard introduced another receipt, which was not presented to the jury over uncensored personal information, showing Chappel was also reimbursed for a Samsung Galaxy Smartwatch.

Chappel is the most important witness to testify in the trial so far and one of the most relevant figures in the case. Chappel’s tip to a police officer in March 2020 worked its way to the FBI and played a key role in the Bureau’s decision to start investigating a Michigan militia group known as the Wolverine Watchmen. The FBI conducted a nearly seven-month investigation into the group and others before arresting six men in October 2020 on charges of conspiracy to kidnap Michigan’s governor, as well as a slew of other charges.",https://www.dailywire.com/news/conspiracy-to-kidnap-a-governor-fbi-told-informant-to-brand-innocent-man-as-federal-agent-to-avoid-suspicion,"GRAND RAPIDS, MI: FBI handlers told informant Dan Chappel to label an “innocent man” a federal agent to avoid potential detection, an attorney said Tuesday in the trial over a conspiracy to kidnap Michigan Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer.",2022-03-22
CBR,Why Did George Perez Have to Drop the Original Ending of His Wonder Woman Run?,I,"In the latest Comic Book Legends Revealed, learn why George Perez had to totally change the original ending of his iconic run on Wonder Woman.

Welcome to Comic Book Legends Revealed! This is the eight hundred and thirty-second installment where we examine three comic book legends and determine whether they are true or false. As usual, there will be three posts, one for each of the three legends. Click here for the first part of this installment's legends.

NOTE: If my Twitter page hits 5,000 followers, I'll do a bonus edition of Comic Book Legends Revealed that week. Great deal, right? So go follow my Twitter page, Brian_Cronin!

COMIC LEGEND:
George Perez had to change the ending of his Wonder Woman run, even after it was initially drawn, because editorial wanted the writer on Wonder Woman after Perez to get to tell that aspect of the story

STATUS:
True

In the second issue of his legendary reboot of Wonder Woman, George Perez (and co-plotter and scripter Greg Potter, as well as inker Bruce Patterson) re-introduced Steve Trevor into the Wonder Woman mythos, but he intentionally made Trevor older so that he was no longer a realistic love interest for Wonder Woman (it was also to tie Steve Trevor to his mother being sort of the replacement for Steve in Wonder Woman's origins, where instead of Steve Trevor coming to Paradise Island, it was his mother)...

Similarly, Perez took the Golden Age supporting character of Etta Candy, who was mostly a joke character during the 1940s, as a Lieutenant in the Air Force...

In that same issue, we see that Etta greatly admired Steve and it was likely that her interest in Steve went beyond strictly admiration...

Perez had Steve and Etta remain regular supporting cast members throughout his run and he had some major plans for him before he left the book, but then his final year on Wonder Woman was marked by some aggravating situations for him.

Perez's exclusive contract with DC expired in 1990, but he agreed to remain on Wonder Woman for 1991 because he wanted to be able to celebrate Wonder Woman's 50th anniversary and eventually that became War of the Gods, as he explained to Patrick Daniel O'Neil in Comics Interview #104, ""I had proposed other things that they could have done for her anniversary. I was really pushing these projects - for example, the anniversary poster, which I drew. They were supposed to be doing a WONDER WOMAN trade paperback. WONDER WOMAN: YEAR ONE, which reprints the first eight issues of my WONDER WOMAN, is nice but I don't consider it an anniversary book - because there's nothing from the fifty years, just from my version. When I first heard about it, they were planning to print it with regular comic paper like they did DEATH IN THE FAMILY and I said, ""For fiftieth anniversary, this is what you're going to give us?""


Now that they're not advertising WAR OF THE GODS as a WONDER WOMAN book they don't have anything to advertise. If I were drawing it, they would have advertised it as such, because then they would have figured that the Perez name would override any negative feedback that would follow a WONDER WOMAN anniversary since DC's faith in Wonder Woman is pretty much nil; other characters that didn't sell well were promoted because it was prestigious.

I was feeling a bit angry because it was like I was the only person fighting for Wonder Woman. Then I lost my editor due to an act of God and of husband because she went into labor. Karen Berger went on maternity leave and so we ended up with an editor who, try as he might, is still a novice who doesn't have the push that Karen has in the company. Everything was starting to fall apart and at this point I was incredibly depressed.""

Perez was also upset that after War of the Gods was announced, DC then announced another 1991 crossover, Armageddon 2001...

He was particularly upset when he saw the house ads for the event, which happened to prominently feature, well, you know, Wonder Woman...

So he was steamed at DC. He had already started drawing Infinity Gauntlet for Marvel (as while he remained on Wonder Woman post 1990, his exclusive contract was over and so he could work for Marvel) and then something happened that put him off DC for a few years.

Wonder Woman #62 was to be his final issue of the series...

And it was going to involve Steve and Etta's wedding...until it didn't. Again, with Pat O'Neil, Perez noted, ""The last straw in the case of Wonder Woman when I have Steve Trevor and Etta Candy getting married in the last issue. I had it in the synopsis months ago, the plot was handed in, I finally scripted it, off it went, and then I receive a phone call saying that Bill Loebs is now the writer and that he was going to be doing doing the wedding. This was something I was setting up and I was the one who wanted to handle it. It could even have been a misunderstanding between Bill and me - maybe he assumed that I was just getting them engaged and he was taking care of the wedding -but the fact was that the entire issue went through all of the final steps, the wedding was there, it was drawn. now they wanted it redrawn and I just refused to rewrite it. I finally was so angry that I had to ask Karen Berger to please send me a check, which they had already delayed by two weeks, and I just hung up the phone. I haven not spoken to anyone at DC Comics since then.""

So the finished issue just had Etta and Steve get engaged, and not married...

Perhaps the saddest thing about it is that Loebs' run went in a whole other direction, as well, so he never got around to actually DOING the wedding (but that's a story for another time). Perez, though, naturally made up with DC and was working there again a few years later.",https://www.cbr.com/george-perez-wonder-woman-war-of-gods-redo-ending/,"George Perez had to change the ending of his Wonder Woman run, even after it was initially drawn, because editorial wanted the writer on Wonder Woman after Perez to get to tell that aspect of the story",2022-03-22
The Daily Wire,"‘What Gives Them The Right To Do That?’ Cornyn Grills Jackson On Unenumerated Rights, ‘Judicial…",I,"Republican Texas Senator John Cornyn grilled Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson on whether her judicial philosophy would lead to her engaging in “judicial policy-making,” during her nomination hearing Tuesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee Tuesday.

Cornyn’s questions began with a line of questioning based on the landmark case Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. Cornyn pointed out that the Obergefell decision overruled referendums in 32 states and “articulated a new fundamental right,” using a legal doctrine called “substantive due process.”

The Supreme Court articulated substantive due process from a confluence of the 5th amendment and the 14th amendment to the Constitution, but “historically it’s been applied in ways that seem to sanction explicit policy-making by the courts,” Cornyn argued, asking whether “substantive due process” was just a tool used by the court to “hide their policy-making under the guise of interpreting the Constitution.”

“The Justices have interpreted the due process clause of the 14th amendment to include a substantive provision, that the rights to due process, they have interpreted that to mean not just procedural rights relative to government action, but also the protection of certain personal rights related to intimacy and autonomy,” Jackson responded, adding that among those rights are the rights to marriage, abortion, and contraception.

“Well the fact is, is it not, that you can use substantive due process to justify basically any result?” Cornyn interjected. “It’s a mode of analysis by the Court that allows the Court to substitute its opinion for the elected representatives of the people. Would you agree?”

“The Court has identified standards for the determination of rights under the 14th amendment substantive due process,” Jackson replied.

“Who gives them the right to do that?” Cornyn asked. “If it’s not mentioned in the Constitution, where does the right of the court [come from] to substitute its views for that of the elected representatives of the people?”

“The Court has interpreted the 14th amendment to include this component, the unenumerated right to substantive due process, and the Court has said that the kinds of things that qualify are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty or deeply rooted in our nation’s history and tradition,” said Jackson.

Cornyn then shifted to the fact that Obergefell overruled the will of the states in recognizing same-sex marriage. “When the Court overrules the decision made by the people … that is an act of judicial policy-making, is it not?”

“Senator, the Supreme Court has considered that to be an application of the substantive due process clause of the 14th amendment,” Jackson responded.

“Well, one of the things that concerns me is, here is an example of the courts finding a new fundamental right that is mentioned nowhere in the document of the Constitution, that’s the product of simply court-made law we’re all supposed salute smartly and follow, because nine people, who are unelected, who have lifetime tenure … five of them decide that this is the way the world should be.” Citing the 9th amendment, Cornyn then asked, “What other rights do you believe exist? And how could we anticipate what those might be?”

Jackson said she could not answer the question because it was hypothetical, but that substantive due process rights were established by Supreme Court precedent.

Cornyn then laid out the reason why he was concerned about applying what he felt were loose Constitutional doctrines. “As a trial judge, of course, you were bound by Circuit Court precedent, and on the Circuit Court you were bound by the Supreme Court precedent. But as a member of the United States Supreme Court you will be bound by nothing. You will be unaccountable to the voters … So you’re not gonna be able to find the answer in some law book somewhere. You’re gonna be presented with a case is gonna be made [that] this is an unenumerated fundamental right, and the voters, whatever they’ve said is irrelevant, because we, five members of the Supreme Court, are gonna decide what the law of the land should be,” Cornyn said.

Justin Bieber may have been with other people before his wife Hailey, but by the time they reconnected in 2019, he was already more than a year into a self-imposed tenure of celibacy. Together, the couple decided to continue to refrain from having sex until they were married — a choice Justin admitted he wished he had made earlier in his life. 

“[God] doesn’t ask us not to have sex for him because he wants rules and stuff. He’s like, I’m trying to protect you from hurt and pain. I think sex can cause a lot of pain. Sometimes people have sex because they don’t feel good enough. Because they lack self-worth. Women do that, and guys do that. I wanted to rededicate myself to God in that way because I really felt it was better for the condition of my soul. And I believe that God blessed me with Hailey as a result,” Justin told Vogue.

3. Adriana Lima

Insecure star Yvonne Orji may have filmed multiple sex scenes for the show, but behind the scenes, she's actually saving herself for marriage. Yvonne, who has yet to tie the knot, says it was her strong faith that encouraged her decision. 

“Before any of [the fame] happened, I sat down with myself and with God and thought, when I make it, how do you want me to represent you while I’m here? It was like, okay, I know why I’m here. It’s to make you proud,"" Orji told People. 



6. Kevin Jonas

“We said, ‘It’s got to be God’s way and not our way.’ We didn’t want to half-step anything. So our right way was the way we felt God wanted us to do it, which was being celibate. We said to God, ‘This is who we are, I know you take us as we are, our faults, our fears, our joys, our hope as a couple and have your way.’ You just have to keep God the center of your relationship,” Tamera told Ebony.

When Ciara and Russell Wilson began dating in 2015, the couple took a vow of celibacy until they walked down the aisle. Ciara explained that abstaining from sex helped them build a stronger foundation for their relationship, which set the tone for their life together. 

""I really believe that when you focus on a friendship, you have the opportunity to build a strong foundation for a relationship — and once you know you're really great friends and you're what we call 'equally yoked,' where you share the same values or the same outlook on life, it kind of sets the tone. Knowing that you'll always have the friendship and that you can always go back to it is very important, and very powerful...You shouldn't feel like you have to give your body away to get someone to like you,"" Ciara told Cosmopolitan South Africa.

“It’s not that we had no intimacy; we just didn’t have complete intimacy. It’s just me, and my feelings. I definitely don’t want to push it on anybody else. But we both have similar beliefs, and I just thought that it would be so much more special if we waited until after we were married. And it was, and it still is,” Mariah told Mirror.

The New York Times,Will One Moldy Berry Ruin the Rest?,I,"Q: If I open a box of berries and one berry is moldy, do I need to throw out the whole box?

Fresh strawberries, blueberries and blackberries are among America’s favorite fruits, but their goodness can be fleeting. Within a few days of bringing them home from the farmer’s market or grocery store, it’s common to find that some gray or white fuzz has staked a claim to a berry or two, prompting many to wonder: Are the rest safe to eat?

Food safety experts say that while you shouldn’t eat berries that are obviously moldy, those without visible signs of the spores are fine to eat. And luckily, unlike other food safety concerns that may be invisible to the naked eye, berries with mold growth are easy to spot, said Benjamin Chapman, a professor and food safety specialist at North Carolina State University. (Botanically minded readers may note that many fruits commonly known as berries, including strawberries, raspberries and blackberries, aren’t true berries, but we will describe them as such for the sake of simplicity.)

If his basket or clamshell is tainted by one or two moldy berries, “I don’t throw out the whole thing,” Dr. Chapman said. Instead, he tosses the moldy ones and carefully inspects adjoining berries for fuzz, which often appears around a bruise or the site of stem attachment. With the rest, he tries to eat them soon, because lingering mold spores may spread and develop more fuzz in a day or two.

Molds are a type of fungi that, when viewed under a microscope, often “look like skinny mushrooms,” according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. They grow threadlike roots that invade the interior of the food, and tiny stalks topped with spores on the surface. Certain types of molds produce toxins that can be harmful if eaten, and in some people, molds can trigger allergic reactions, Dr. Chapman said.

The good news for berry eaters is that the molds commonly found on them “are actually not known to produce toxins, like some fungi do, and so there’s less risk,” said Elizabeth Mitcham, a professor and director of the Postharvest Technology Center at the University of California, Davis. Foods that have been found to grow these more dangerous molds include nuts, grains and apples, she said.

Because molds on berries are usually innocuous, even accidentally eating a moldy berry — though not recommended — would be unlikely to make you sick, Dr. Mitcham said. Also, “you would probably spit it out before you managed to swallow it,” because moldy berries “have a very off, very bad flavor,” she added.

Mold is a common enemy of berry growers and sellers, so it’s not surprising to find it in your berry basket, Dr. Mitcham said. Mold spores are ubiquitous in the environment; they can be carried by air or water and live in the soil of farm fields. The spores typically infect a berry plant’s flowers or fruit and then lie dormant until the fruit fully ripens. Given enough time, those spores will eventually germinate and can spread to adjoining fruits, especially in warmer temperatures, Dr. Mitcham said.

Because mold spores are so pervasive, they’re probably present in small amounts on most fresh produce you eat. “I’m likely consuming mold spores all the time, and those mold spores are not making me sick,” Dr. Chapman said.

Molds become more dangerous when they grow and invade deeper into the food product, where some types produce toxins. While this isn’t usually a problem with berries because of their shape, small size and the types of molds that grow on them, it is a greater concern with larger foods that are moist or have a soft or porous texture, like leftover meats or casseroles, jams and jellies, soft cheeses and breads. If there is mold on the surface of these foods, you should assume they are contaminated within and throw them away, according to the U.S.D.A.

Before buying berries, inspect them carefully and avoid purchasing any with even slight signs of mold, Dr. Chapman said. At home, do another quick check and remove any fruit that is visibly moldy; then refrigerate the rest as soon as possible, Dr. Mitcham said. Don’t wash berries until just before you plan to eat them or cook with them, because moisture encourages mold growth, she added.

Mold spores can settle and survive on surfaces, so it’s a good idea to clean your fridge regularly “to break the mold spore cycle,” Dr. Chapman said. The U.S.D.A. recommends cleaning the inside of your fridge with a tablespoon of baking soda dissolved in a quart of water every few months. And if you discover food that’s “egregiously moldy” in your fridge, you might decide that “Yep, today’s the day that I’m going to clean it out,” to prevent too many spores from making themselves at home and spreading to other foods, he added.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/07/well/eat/berry-mold-spoil-box.html,"Food safety experts say that while you shouldn’t eat berries that are obviously moldy, those without visible signs of the spores are fine to eat.

Global News,Kids and COVID-19 resilience: How much stress is too much?,I,"As any parent can attest, one thing that’s helped push them through the hardships of the COVID-19 pandemic has been a promise, and sometimes a prayer: “Kids are resilient. They will be OK.”

The line has been fed to guardians and caregivers worldwide, by doctors, politicians and well-meaning sympathetic onlookers.

But as the pandemic drags on, having just passed its two-year anniversary, is it really that simple? Is there a limit to a child’s resilience?

Before considering resilience, Sheri Madigan, a clinical psychologist and Director of the Determinants of Child Development Lab at the University of Calgary, says we need to first look at how the pandemic has affected the mental health of children and adolescents over the past two years.

“When we look at how kids were doing pre-pandemic and how they’re doing during the pandemic, we (are) seeing higher rates of depression, anxiety and eating disorders,” Madigan told Global News, pointing to her recent work that examined how more than 80,000 youth worldwide were coping approximately a year-and-a-half into the pandemic.

The study, titled Global Prevalence of Depressive and Anxiety Symptoms in Children and Adolescents During COVID-19: A Meta-analysis, found that the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms in children and adolescents has doubled when compared to pre-pandemic estimates.

The difference between resilience and ‘bouncing back’
“In disasters like the pandemic, although some people use the notion of ‘bouncing back’ as being equivalent to ‘resilience,’ we have moved away from that simplistic idea of resilience,” says Robin Cox, a professor in the Disaster and Emergency Management graduate programs at Royal Roads University.

“In a disaster we talk about resilience as more the ability to anticipate what is going to happen and the ability to weather it and continue to function as more changes are happening.”

Madigan agrees.

“People often talk about resilience like it’s this trait — either you’re resilient or you’re not resilient,” she shared. “But, actually, resilience is two pieces — you have an adversity or difficult circumstances, and then you have whether you can draw on supports and strategies to help.”

A matter of context
Digging into what truly makes someone resilient requires a look at individual circumstances, says Cox.

Not everyone has had to endure or survive the same circumstances in this pandemic, and various conditions can affect one’s resilience.

Access to health care, good food, sufficient income, adequate housing, and job stability will all help with one’s resilience, she says.

Also important are breaks from stressful life situations, a proper amount of rest and relaxation, as well as access informal supports, like time with family and friends or access to fulfilling hobbies or activities.

“People with greater resources generally tend to be better off,” she says.

Cox also says the longer the pandemic drags on and the more curve balls it throws in terms of new waves, variants and changing restrictions, “one’s capacity to recover and carry on can be diminished.”

Lagging support
Looking at the recent figures, Madigan says there’s a lack in those supports and strategies, especially on a societal level.

Part of the problem, she says, is that there might be an expectation that kids will “bounce back” and our society is taking a wait-and-see approach.

“I think that people are counting on — as we move into a post-pandemic future — that we will see some of this distress amongst youth attenuate or that, maybe, it will go back to those pre-pandemic estimates.”

Before the pandemic, only about a quarter of children who really needed mental health services were getting them, she says — so, now, an already stressed support is becoming even harder to access.

“Many clinicians around Canada have tried to sound the alarm to a youth mental health crisis in the hope that that will get policy makers recognizing that we need to allocate more resources and make mental health supports more available to kids.”

Being mindful
While the research points to a growing adolescent mental health crisis, Cox says it’s still possible to unlock additional resilience with intentional actions.

“Part of resilience is being mindful of resilience — thinking, ‘Where am I at? Where are my kids at? What do I need to do, to support my resilience?'”

Madigan agrees that parents should also be mindful of their own well-being, too, instead of keeping all focus on their kids.

“When parents aren’t doing well, that can have a spillover onto their kids,” she warns.

Connection and communication are key
Right now, says Madigan, connection and communication as a family unit shouldn’t be underestimated or underappreciated, as it’s one of the ways kids feel safest and most supported.

She also points to a silver lining of the pandemic: it opened up lines of communication in a lot of households, and kids who’ve been strongly connected to their families “are doing better in the pandemic, overall.”

Parents can continue to support their kids’ resilience by continuing to talk to their children and mirror healthy coping mechanisms, say both scholars.

“Acknowledging that the pandemic is stressful and that it has been really hard can go a long way,” says Cox, who also encourages parents to listen to their children without judgment.

“I encourage parents to keep having those conversations — what’s next, what’s going on in school. Keep talking to kids,” advises Madigan.

“I think those patterns of relationships have been established and we need to keep them up.”

The power of routine
Also important, say Madigan and Cox, is keeping basic, simple routines for kids and allowing some leeway for activities and relationships that help their development, like friendships and extra-curricular activities.

It’s also OK to not want to go back to “pre-pandemic normal,” they both said, and we shouldn’t put that pressure on ourselves or others, especially in times like these when we appear to be getting a break from the pandemic but it’s not truly over.

A bright spot for kids right now is the ability to be in school full-time, say both, with a relaxation of cohorting and activity restrictions.

""In the last eight months, we have seen our education system rapidly adapting to the changes forced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Society at large can learn from some of the solutions....""
#covid19 #education #adaptation #climatechange

READ: https://resiliencebydesign.com/covid-19-how-our-educators-and-the-education-system-are-adapting/

Schools, they both explain, provide kids with the benefit of routine, friendship, support systems outside the family, and a chance to be creative and learn new things — all important in building resilience.

Too soon to tell
In many ways, it’s too soon to tell how kids — both on a widespread and individual level — will leave the pandemic in terms of overall well-being, says Madigan. But she assures parents that most children likely won’t hold onto intense anxieties surrounding masking or public health measures as time passes.

She also suggests that kids might actually walk away from the pandemic having benefitted from such turmoil in their young lives.

“As a silver lining, it’s my hope that kids have become more adaptable for no other reason than they’ve been asked to adapt.”

Cox says that over time, when we’re able to put some distance between ourselves and the pandemic, “those stressors on kids will reduce.”

In the meantime, she reminds parents to keep in mind how these current hard times might benefit kids later in life: “Prior exposure to trauma can increase resilience because there’s that experience of having survived something and knowing that one can survive something else.”",https://globalnews.ca/news/8702757/children-mental-health-covid-resiliency-canada/,"“People often talk about resilience like it’s this trait — either you’re resilient or you’re not resilient,” she shared. “But, actually, resilience is two pieces — you have an adversity or difficult circumstances, and then you have whether you can draw on supports and strategies to help.”

A matter of context
Digging into what truly makes someone resilient requires a look at individual circumstances, says Cox.

Not everyone has had to endure or survive the same circumstances in this pandemic, and various conditions can affect one’s resilience.

Access to health care, good food, sufficient income, adequate housing, and job stability will all help with one’s resilience, she says.

Also important are breaks from stressful life situations, a proper amount of rest and relaxation, as well as access informal supports, like time with family and friends or access to fulfilling hobbies or activities.

Global News,The great COVID-19 infodemic: How disinformation networks are radicalizing Canadians,I,"A common refrain of those opposed to vaccines is that immunizations are harmful to people’s health and an infringement on human rights. Any kind of science proving the efficacy of any vaccine is often denied.

In 2021, those health concerns have mutated into a widespread belief among the most staunchly anti-vaccine that if you receive a COVID-19 vaccine dose, you will almost certainly die.

The latter is a baseless conspiracy theory. But tens of thousands of Canadians believe it’s true and have created social media channels to promote it.

In an attempt to find the nucleus of the Canadian misinformation campaign, I spent a month immersed in the online world of anti-vaccine communities across the country.

I joined anti vaccine and anti-mandate groups on Telegram and Facebook, witnessing them transform from meeting places for the unvaccinated to a virtual confluence of hatred and disinformation — where I observed, for instance, calls for medical experts to be hanged and people comparing mass vaccination to genocide.

Alongside organizing countrywide anti-vaccine rallies, tens of thousands of Canadians are sharing fake news stories around rising stillbirth numbers, deaths caused by the COVID-19 vaccine and baseless theories of an impending social credit system that begins with QR codes.

Many of the people in these groups seem to believe all of this, despite a lack of proof.

The social networks
 

The COVID-19 “infodemic” — the spread of misinformation alongside the spread of a virus — has been described as one of the greatest threats to overcoming the pandemic. But it’s also nothing new; false narratives swirled around the polio vaccine in the 1950s, too. The major difference in 2021, is that we have social media.

While social media giants such as Facebook and Twitter say they are doing their best to stamp out COVID-19 misinformation, such groups continue to hide in plain sight. All they’ve done is gotten more creative with their names; searches for “anti vaccine Canada” won’t turn up any results, but plug in synonyms for “freedom” or “unity” and “Canada” and you’ll find plenty.

Others have migrated to alternative messaging sites such as Telegram. This is where you’ll find “Unvaxxed Canada,” “Vaccine Choice Canada” and “BC Interior Freedom Fighters” and the various region-specific and career-specific groups they have spawned, which include hundreds of members regularly espousing anti-vaccine sentiments. There are now groups for unvaccinated healthcare workers, teachers, police officers and federal employees.

READ MORE: Job sites for unvaccinated thrive as vaccine mandates exclude employees

Many share links to petitions challenging vaccine mandates, links to fake news stories about exaggerated vaccine side effects, and despite the inherent distrust of the mainstream media, links to news articles in the mainstream media. Information is shared about public venues — gyms and restaurants, mostly — not enforcing vaccine mandates. Channels of businesses against mandates exist with thousands of subscribers.

It’s impossible to tell how many channels there are, as new ones pop up every few days. Participant numbers in each channel range between a few hundred to 50,000 — and they’re growing.

Canada Unity FacebookView image in full screen
Canada Unity, an anti-vaccine group, now has more than 40,000 members.
A month ago, “Canada Unity,” a Facebook group regularly sharing anti-vaccine posts and misinformation, had 32,000 members. It now has 40,500. Vaccine Choice Canada on Telegram grew by 1,000 members to 15,773, and Unvaxxed Canada, while having only 750 members, has spawned at least 15 separate regional groups.

By-and-large, this is not the realm of the vaccine-hesitant. This is thousands of people hell-bent on telling you that the virus does not exist, the vaccine is a bioweapon designed to kill, and the unvaccinated are the only ones “awake” to mass genocide.

A COVID-19 “informational” video for Vaccine Choice Canada, a group founded in the 1980s, that says it’s against vaccine mandates, relies almost solely on disinformation. The video asserts that vaccines “alter” people’s DNA, that there is no clinical evidence the vaccine is effective, and that proven low-cost medications are being kept off the market.

It follows a rule that emerges very clearly after you join: that most narratives fly in the face of real, verified medical information.

Of the main vaccines approved for use in Canada, the Pfizer vaccine has proven to be 95 per cent effective in protecting people from catching COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, while the Moderna vaccine was 94.1 per cent effective and AstraZeneca was 62 per cent.

That has, however, changed recently in the face of the Omicron variant. A two-dose Pfizer/BioNTech vaccination now provides just 33 per cent protection against infection against Omicron, but 70 per cent protection against hospitalization, according to a large-scale analysis in South Africa. However, public health advice has not changed: vaccination remains the strongest line of defence against severe illness.

But science is routinely cast aside in these groups. Dissent against disinformation is rarely seen. Only in recent days have comments begun to appear questioning the veracity of random posts.

“People need to stop posting s–t they read on the internet, do your research, you aren’t helping,” someone says in “Unvaxxed Canada” under a false claim that Sobey’s is no longer accepting unvaccinated shoppers.

Posts directly underneath are of an old hoax stating Apple will remove Telegram from phones without notice, a Tiktok video reacting to a Miami school citing discredited info in a policy for vaccinated students to stay home for 30 days (a rule which was later scrapped), and a video of U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson with a caption supposedly announcing “93 per cent of PCR tests don’t work.”

This caption is false. Johnson was being interviewed about the limitations of airport testing.

None of these were questioned.

The theories
Most mid-sized channels, of a few thousand participants, share hundreds of comments per day. Mostly, they assert the pandemic is a hoax or its dangers have been overstated and the media and the pharmaceutical industry are knowingly suppressing this information.

Memes about the “asleep,” or vaccinated, portion of society — 87 per cent of Canadians aged over 12 — underline the theory that people are only taking vaccines out of fear, cowering behind their masks, as the unvaccinated fight for freedom.

It seems ironic then, that fear seems to be fueling much of their own narrative.

vaccine children covidView image in full screen
A Telegram channel discusses Covid-19 vaccine efficacy in children.
A new lexicon fuels emotion. People aren’t just unvaccinated anymore, they’re “unstabbed,” “unjabbed,” and the Harry Potter-esque, “pure bloods.”

The vaccine is a “death shot,” “death jab,” “suicide pill” (despite the vaccine being an injection), “quackzeen,” “clot shot,” “witches brew,” “frankenjab.” The pandemic becomes “plandemic.”

Coupled with pseudoscientific content from non-experts, anti-vaxxers have created an alternative world.

Comments accuse the government of deliberately trying to depopulate an, already quite unpopulated, country. A message regularly appears from Ontario MPP Randy Hillier, posted on Hillier’s Facebook page on Nov. 15, falsely claiming Public Health Ontario (PHO) is investigating 37 possible deaths due to vaccines.

READ MORE: Ontario MPPs vote unanimously to condemn Randy Hillier’s COVID-19 posts

Hillier’s claim is not true. PHO does not investigate deaths after vaccines, the Ministry of Health does. The ministry investigates all deaths categorized as “near the period of time where an individual received a COVID-19 vaccine.”

Since the start of the pandemic, Ontario has recorded eight deaths that met the provincial definition for an adverse event following immunization (AEFI). However, “these reports have not been clearly attributed to other causes and should not be interpreted as causally related with a COVID-19 vaccine,” PHO said in a statement.

A further 28 deaths had occurred that did not meet the provincial AEFI definition and preliminary information suggested that those who died had “multiple co-morbidities which may be related to the cause of death” and “there has been no association with a vaccine identified at this time.”

“Public Health Ontario is not investigating any of these reports,” a spokesperson said.

When contacted, Hillier stood by his statements, claiming that deaths and adverse events were not being properly recorded by PHO. He said people should be “skeptical” of the vaccines and should be doing what was best for themselves rather than the wider population. He said he had never followed any public health advice on masks or social distancing and had “never been sick,” but admitted he had never taken a COVID-19 test.

READ MORE: Fact check — COVID-19 vaccines are not causing a rise in stillbirths in Canada

 

In reality, very few deaths can be definitively linked to the vaccines in Canada. According to federal data, 248 deaths have occurred following the administration of 61.5 million vaccine doses. However, 88 are “unlikely” linked to the vaccine, 119 could not be assessed due to insufficient information and 41 are under investigation. This pales in comparison to the number of COVID-related deaths in Canada, which now stands at 30,012. So this theory, like so many others, actually inadvertently supports vaccine use.

Others just rely on no one doing their homework.

A recent TikTok video tried to prove there were fewer COVID-19 cases in Toronto than were being announced. The video pointed to the University Health Network’s (UHN) website, which says it was treating three COVID-19 patients. The poster said UHN “represents all five Toronto hospitals.”

Toronto has about 40 hospitals. UHN is just one provider.

Toronto UHNView image in full screen
A conspiracy theory video on Tiktok falsely claims UHN is the only hospital provider in Toronto.
Other theories are more sinister. People claim variants are being released by governments on cue. There are parallels drawn between Nazi Germany and Canada; Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Adolf Hitler; concentration camps and isolation facilities.

In recent weeks, baseless claims that stillbirths were “exploding” across Canada found a foothold on Telegram. An unverified article claimed there had been 86 stillbirths in six months at an unspecified hospital in Waterloo, Ont. and 13 in an unspecified 24-hour period at a Vancouver hospital.

We debunked that theory very quickly, simply by requesting official statistics. Data from the Better Outcomes Registry & Network (BORN), Ontario’s perinatal, newborn and child registry, shows there were between 12 and 15 stillbirths in the entire Waterloo region between January and June 2021. Data from Vancouver Coastal Health from April to late August 2021 reveals there were just four stillbirths across VCH’s seven hospitals in that period.

But these theories refuse to die. The same links are shared over and over, existing in a vacuum.

The hysteria
As the weeks drag on, conspiracy theories have grown more outlandish, and far less rooted in any semblance of fact.

It was apparent when children were approved for vaccines on Nov. 19.

“Starting Tuesday, they’re coming for Canada’s 5 to 11-year-olds,” one person on Telegram wrote.

Another said the vaccine would “maim, sterilize and kill their babies.”

“I feel bad for the kids of these brainwashed parents. There is zero benefit to these kids but so much potential risk,” another said.

Many say they will take their children out of school. Others employ their sons and daughters at anti-vaccine rallies, proudly posting their pictures, looking confused and uninterested, holding placards that say “human experimentation is illegal” and “children need to breathe.”

Links to warnings of the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis (heart inflammations) appear repeatedly, with accusations lobbied at governments and mainstream media for covering it up.

But all of this information is freely available online.

READ MORE: ‘Boycott Chapman’s’ — Why anti-vaccine groups are taking aim at ice cream

Side-effects from the vaccine are possible, of course. But the reason the mainstream media rarely writes about it is because instances are rare and in line with those expected from any vaccine.

The government publishes weekly data on adverse side effects. According to the latest data, until Dec. 3, of the 61.5 million vaccine doses administered in Canada, there have been 28,825 adverse event reports (0.047 per cent of all doses administered). Of those, 6,581 were considered serious (0.011 per cent of all doses). The most common side effects were tingling or prickling, vaccine site pain and headaches.

Myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported in 1,428 patients across the country (0.0023 per cent of all doses), in the same time frame.

The risk of either disease is substantially more after a COVID-19 infection itself. In a study of hospitalized people of all ages in the United States between March 2020 and January 2021, the risk of myocarditis was 16 times higher for people with COVID-19 infections.

Another conspiracy theory insists the recent devastating floods in B.C. were planned as a distraction tactic as vaccinations ramped up. There’s a listicle of people who have had a leg amputated after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, hosted on a vaccine misinformation website. There’s a list of hundreds of professional soccer players who have recently died, or collapsed while playing, with unverified claims they were all vaccinated. There’s a paper on Pfizer’s “global war to abuse and attempt to murder as many children as possible with their deadly COVID-19 injections.”

Things get extremely meta one day when one person asks: “What if this channel is for nothing more than tracking and documenting the unvaxxed in order to pinpoint their relative locations?”

All of these conspiracy theories would be easily debunked with one simple question: “Why?”

But nobody asks.

The public distrust
Distrust of doctors and media is openly encouraged. Rallies are organized outside hospitals.

“Terrorists these days wear suits, ties and white coats,” one commenter says.

“The pure bloods know to stay away from hospitals because the vaccinated doctors and nurses will kill them,” another says.

People call for boycotts of just about any company enforcing mandates. The Chapman’s ice-cream boycott began on Telegram.

fake covid vaccine certificateView image in full screen
Someone posts an offer for a fake Covid-19 vaccine certificate on Telegram.
The lines between the anti-vaccine movement and the far-right continue to blur. Anti-abortion, anti-Islam and anti-5G comments are common.

There are promises of fake vaccine cards, offering QR codes and information uploaded into “the Pfizer website” for a fee of between $400 and $1,000. They appear to be scams. But it doesn’t matter anyway; the unvaccinated say this would be inadvertently complying with the rules.

The vortex
As time goes on, it becomes clear why the pull of these dark holes of distrust have become so powerful: because the very same technology companies who are vowing to combat them are inadvertently promoting them, via algorithms that boost pages you most engage with.

The more time I spend on anti-vaccine groups on Facebook, the more they top my news feed, becoming so entwined with friends’ pregnancy and new job announcements, that it’s difficult to discern which is which. Disinformation is now being offered up to me before my morning coffee.

It is also platform-agnostic. Conspiracy theories shared on Telegram will later appear on Facebook and Twitter, and vice-versa. Tiktok videos are downloaded and shared on other platforms. If you’re a member of one platform, you’re consuming all of the above.

Facebook has long defended its fight against misinformation. It introduced social media stickers to show users when friends and family get vaccinated, display warnings on COVID-19 information that fact checkers have deemed false, and added labels to posts that discuss vaccines.

In a statement, Alex Kucharski, Meta (Facebook’s parent company) Canada’s communications manager said 24 million pieces of content from Facebook and Instagram have been removed globally for violating misinformation policies. The company would not release Canada-specific data or answer specific questions about its misinformation policies.

“Meta is committed to not only fighting the spread of harmful health information on our platforms, but also working to ensure Canadians have access to reliable information to make informed decisions about their health,” Kucharski said.

The participants
But then, the virus breaks the anti-vaccine ranks without a hint of irony.

A man told a Telegram channel in early December that his entire family had contracted COVID-19.

“My wife and I are very sick. It’s no joke,” he wrote, asking for help.

Some compared experiences. Others post recipes for “homemade hydroxychloroquine” or suggest going to buy ivermectin, both unverified treatments for COVID-19.

The conversation then returns to how the vaccine is killing people and not the virus.

It’s difficult to determine exactly who these people are. Results from cycle two of the Public Health Agency of Canada’s COVID-19 vaccination coverage survey released earlier this year showed, of the five per cent of Canadians who did not intend to get vaccinated, they tended to be younger, male, have less than a post-secondary education, and a household income of less than $60,000.

This data was recently posted in an anti-vaccine channel — with the poster asserting those with lower education levels were the most “awake.”

High-profile purveyors of anti-vaccine sentiments are portrayed as heroes. U.S. President Donald Trump is revered, as are discredited medical professionals.

Advertisements promote a speaker series of prominent “activists”: David Icke,  Americans Ty and Charlene Bollinger, infamous Canadian anti-vaccine protestor Chris Sky (Saccocia). Though Sky boasts more than 50,000 Telegram subscribers, some of the unvaccinated now label him a “grifter” and ask for his videos to be removed from public channels.

READ MORE: Politicians hanged in effigy at protest at B.C. legislature reflect disturbing trend, experts say

Queen’s University assistant professor and family doctor Michelle Cohen, who has been researching Canada’s infodemic, says the anti-vaccine movement is “laundering” false information through some right-wing politicians and former medical professionals to legitimize “whatever lies they want.”

“It’s giving a kind of a legitimizing gloss to the political movement,” she says.

“They’re so completely within their echo chambers of their own media, that they’re just within this little universe, and it doesn’t really matter what criticism they get from the outside. But then in the meantime, these echo chambers are just proliferating.”

Cohen says that despite the anti-vaccine movement representing a small portion of society, its ideologies are seeping into right-wing politics.

“This feels like it’s gone from being just like, ‘Oh, this is just in the alternative world. And this is just a conspiracy theory, we can kind of ignore it,’ to ‘This has pulled growing political power.'”

She believes more needs to be done, at a federal and provincial level, to counter the flow of false information.

Fact checking is routinely eschewed because people are “tribally associated” with the movement and the community, she says.

“You can really develop a solid-like bulletproof echo chamber that no facts can penetrate.”

The line in the sand
 

What has become abundantly clear is that being anti-vaccine is no longer simply a personal choice — it is a way of life for many. A line in the sand has been drawn in recent weeks, as workplace mandates come into force.

In one channel, someone posits the question: “Any unvaccinated guys here having trouble finding unvaccinated women in Ontario/ Quebec?”

Someone replies: “Vaxxed women are sterile and can spread their spike proteins.”

Another says the vaccine can be shared via sexual intercourse. Another says they don’t want any vaccinated people in their house.

“Human shedding” of the virus is impossible. COVID-19 vaccines in Canada do not contain the live virus, and thus it is not possible for any “viral shedding” to occur.

Unvaccinated people on a Telegram channel speak about navigating the world of dating during the pandemic.
One woman says her husband got vaccinated while she was out of town and she no longer feels she can be intimate with him. Another woman says her boyfriend did the same, so she has been avoiding him.

“I would never lie to a woman about my vaccination status. In fact, it’s the first thing I ask now to women. If they’re vaxxed, I move on,” the original poster says.

“That’s hot,” a woman replies.

“Thx. You from Qbc/Ontario?”

Someone asks if there are any unvaxxed dating sites yet. Apparently there are.

Someone says they’ve been barred from a family Christmas lunch for being unvaccinated. Another recounts cutting off his own family.

“I don’t regret walking away from any of my control freak braindead blood relatives because there’s so much more time for meeting new spiritual family, like many of you.”

The lack of action
Despite the retweets and hashtags, these groups have had little impact outside of their virtual bubbles. Rallies continue, but accomplish little more than a few hours of traffic disruption. Petitions and potential lawsuits are routinely threatened — some solicit for money to fund them — but continue to fail.

The latest call to action is for people to carry black marker pens to scribble on QR codes in public places — thus, they say, rendering them ineffective. But, the campaign itself seems ineffective, too.

“I tried it and it didn’t work,” one poster wrote.

Global News,Omicron FAQ: Everything you need to know about the COVID-19 variant,I,"For nearly two years, the COVID-19 pandemic has thrown countless curve balls at Canadians and it shows no sign of stopping.

Enter Omicron, a new variant that is spreading quickly and replacing the Delta variant as the dominant strain in several countries.

Many scientists are studying the mutation, seeking to provide answers to the hundreds of questions being asked.

Here is what we know about Omicron so far. Much of this could change, and when it does, this post will be updated as needed.


Where was Omicron found?
Towards the end of November, COVID-19 infections in South Africa began increasing steeply. While studying the spike, scientists came across a new mutation on Nov. 24.

Shortly after its discovery, South African officials alerted the world to the new variant. Two days after the mutation was found, the World Health Organization designated it a variant of concern, as it had previously with Delta and Alpha, and named it Omicron.

Since its discovery, Omicron has been confirmed to be found in 149 countries, including Canada, according to WHO, with cases doubling every two to three days.

Omicron’s “substantial growth advantage” over the Delta variant means it is likely to soon overtake it as the dominant variant in those countries, the U.N. health agency said.

According to the WHO, Omicron poses a “very high” risk to the world’s fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.

Omicron symptoms
Some preliminary evidence has emerged about Omicron, including its symptoms, which seem to be slightly different from Delta according to Dr. Angelique Coetzee, chair of South Africa’s medical association. She recently told Global News that patients she’s aware of are reporting headaches and body aches, and a slight sore throat.

Commonly reported symptoms of Omicron included cough, fatigue and congestion or runny nose, according to the WHO. It cited U.S. data during the update, which the WHO said looked at 43 partially and fully vaccinated individuals who were infected with Omicron, the majority being 18 to 39 years of age.

Recently, the WHO reported growing evidence that Omicron is causing milder symptoms, and that it’s affecting the upper part of the body.

However, the WHO cites that early data suggests severity increases with age and in the presence of underlying medical conditions, as well as among people who are not vaccinated.

“Also, current evidence about severity and hospitalization comes largely from countries with high levels of population immunity, and there remains uncertainty about the severity of Omicron in populations with different vaccination coverage and prior exposure to other variants,” the agency said on Jan. 7.

How fast does Omicron spread?
The transmissibility of Omicron has concerned researchers worldwide, and Canadian officials have projected that if it replaces Delta as the dominant strain in the country, daily infections could hit 26,600 a day nationally by mid-January.

Ontario — the only province tracking Omicron’s reproductive rate — has reported that it’s infecting almost two times as many people as the Delta variant.


On Jan. 7, Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam said Omicron is now the “predominant strain” of the virus in the country.

Studies are emerging with encouraging results on the severity of Omicron. The WHO has acknowledged that Omicron appears to cause less severe disease, but it shouldn’t be called “mild.”

In Ontario, researchers announced on Dec. 30 they found the risk of hospitalization or death was 54 per cent lower for Omicron cases as compared to Delta cases. Researchers examined more than 6,000 cases between Nov. 22 and Dec. 17, but warn due to the transmissibility of Omicron, “the absolute number of hospitalizations and impact on the health-care system is likely to be significant.”

The U.K. Health Security Agency announced on Dec. 23 its findings that those with the Omicron variant were 50 to 70 per cent less likely to be hospitalized compared to those with Delta. One researcher called the finding from preliminary data “a small ray of sunlight.”

Meanwhile, Imperial College London published a study a day earlier that showed that those infected with Omicron were around 20 per cent less likely to go to the hospital at all than those who have the Delta variant, and 40 per cent less likely to be hospitalized for a night or more.

The analysis was based on all COVID-19 cases confirmed by PCR tests in England in the first half of December, of which there were 56,000 cases of Omicron and 269,000 cases of Delta.

Earlier data out of South Africa also showed that Omicron is causing less severe illness than other variants. According to South Africa’s National Institute for Communicable Diseases, only 30 per cent of those hospitalized with COVID-19 in recent weeks have been seriously ill.

Omicron’s impact on the elderly is still one of the big unanswered questions as most of the cases studied so far have been in younger people.

How many vaccinated are being infected
 

The WHO said Jan. 7 there is preliminary data from multiple non-peer reviewed studies suggesting that there is a reduction in protection against Omicron in individuals who have received two-vaccine doses and in those previously infected with COVID-19.

Also, increased risk of reinfection has been reported in South Africa, the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Israel, all suggesting immune evasion against Omicron.


The recent numbers emerging from the province can provide a snapshot of how Canadians with different vaccination statuses are faring against the variant.

The Ontario government’s latest figures indicate 80 per cent of cases were among the fully vaccinated. According to the government, 82 per cent of Ontario’s eligible population five and older are fully inoculated.

How effective are vaccines against Omicron?
Vaccines are still one of the best ways to protect yourself against COVID-19, according to Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada’s top doctor.

Speaking to reporters on Dec. 13, she urged those who “haven’t had the vaccine” to “get the first and second doses, including the younger children.”

However, that doesn’t mean vaccines don’t offer some measure of protection. Early studies show that the vaccines are still very effective at keeping you out of the hospital if you catch Omicron.


Pfizer: According to the latest findings from South Africa, people who are double vaccinated against COVID-19 with the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine have 33 per cent protection against Omicron infection. However, the vaccine offered 70 per cent protection against hospitalization, according to Discovery Health, South Africa’s largest private health insurer, and the South African Medical Research Council.

Moderna: Moderna’s efficacy against Omicron was tested alongside Pfizer’s in research done at the University of California. That research – which has yet to be peer-reviewed – found that after two doses of an mRNA vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna, efficacy against symptomatic infection from Omicron is only about 30 per cent – down from about 87 per cent versus Delta. The findings were later supported in pre-publication research from Moderna, which also found Moderna is less effective against Omicron.

The researchers added that protection against severe disease still sat around 86 per cent for recent mRNA vaccination against Omicron, and 67 per cent for waned immunity, according to Reuters.

How effective are the boosters at fighting Omicron?
The most important thing Canadians can do now is follow public health advice and “get your booster shots,” Tam said.

The early findings about boosters are promising. The United States’ top doctor, Anthony Fauci, has said that “booster vaccine regimens work against Omicron,” whether your dose is Pfizer or Moderna. He cited new data from the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).

Research from the University of California indicates boosters can push protection against Omicron infection back up to roughly 48 per cent. As for preventing severe disease, boosters appear to push that efficacy back up to 91 per cent.

A study released in the United Kingdom also found a COVID booster shot can provide 71 to 75 per cent against mild symptoms of COVID-19.

Moderna recently shared a half dose of its vaccine as a booster increased neutralizing antibodies against Omicron 37 fold. A full shot as a booster dose of the same vaccine drove antibody levels even higher – more than 80 times pre-boost levels.

A Danish study released late last month indicated that a third dose of either Pfizer or Moderna offers a “significant increase” in protection against Omicron in elderly people.

The WHO also said Jan. 7 that booster shots increase vaccine effectiveness.

How effective are treatments at battling Omicron?
New COVID-19 treatments are also showing promising signs when it comes to the Omicron variant. Pfizer said on Dec. 14 its experimental COVID-19 pill appears to be effective against the Omicron variant.

The full results of Pfizer’s 2,250-person study found the drug reduced combined hospitalizations and deaths by about 89 per cent among high-risk adults when taken shortly after initial COVID-19 symptoms.

Separate laboratory testing also showed that the drug still works when it faces off against the Omicron variant, according to Pfizer.

The pill has since been approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and has also been approved by Health Canada.

Merck, which makes the antiviral treatment molnupiravir, said its drug should have similar activity against any new COVID-19 variant, a company executive said during a general presentation not specific to Omicron last month.

Molnupiravir was shown to reduce hospitalizations and deaths by around 30 per cent in a clinical trial of high-risk individuals early in the course of the illness. It was approved for use in the United States by the FDA recently.

Merck’s treatment is still under Health Canada review.

What Omicron means for COVID-19 restrictions
Since Omicron’s emergence in Canada, governments have been introducing restrictions to slow its spread.

It began with travel restrictions from countries in Africa where the variant was discovered. Then at the federal level, the government advised against non-essential international travel as cases spiked worldwide.

Ahead of the holidays, governments in Canada began imposing restrictions to limit community spread, and they have continued to be introduced in January.

Ontario, which has reported record-breaking daily COVID-19 infections, has introduced a near province-wide shutdown to slow Omicron’s spread and preserve hospital capacity. Indoor dining, gyms and theatres are among the activities Ontarians can no longer do until Jan. 26 at the earliest.

In Quebec, the government introduced a curfew in addition to other measures to calm record infection numbers in the province.

Every province except Saskatchewan has delayed the return to in-person schooling as well to the dismay of parents and students who wanted to return to classes following the holidays.

Why Omicron after Delta
The World Health Organization (WHO) skipped two letters in the Greek alphabet in going from Delta to Omicron when naming the most recent SARS-CoV-2 variant.

The name Omicron comes after “nu” and “xi” in the alphabet, which the WHO said they skipped to avoid confusing the public and causing offence.

“`Nu’ is too easily confounded with ‘new,’ and `xi’ was not used because it is a common last name,” the WHO wrote in a statement to the Associated Press.

The organization added that it is not their intent to cause any “offence to any cultural, social, national, regional, professional or ethnic groups.” It is the first time the WHO skipped over a letter to name a variant.",https://globalnews.ca/news/8453515/omicron-covid-variant-explained/,"
Here is what we know about Omicron so far. Much of this could change, and when it does, this post will be updated as needed.


Where was Omicron found?
Towards the end of November, COVID-19 infections in South Africa began increasing steeply. While studying the spike, scientists came across a new mutation on Nov. 24.

Omicron symptoms
Some preliminary evidence has emerged about Omicron, including its symptoms, which seem to be slightly different from Delta according to Dr. Angelique Coetzee, chair of South Africa’s medical association. She recently told Global News that patients she’s aware of are reporting headaches and body aches, and a slight sore throat.

Commonly reported symptoms of Omicron included cough, fatigue and congestion or runny nose, according to the WHO. It cited U.S. data during the update, which the WHO said looked at 43 partially and fully vaccinated individuals who were infected with Omicron, the majority being 18 to 39 years of age.

countries with high levels of population immunity, and there remains uncertainty about the severity of Omicron in populations with different vaccination coverage and prior exposure to other variants,” the agency said on Jan. 7.

How fast does Omicron spread?
The transmissibility of Omicron has concerned researchers worldwide, and Canadian officials have projected that if it replaces Delta as the dominant strain in the country, daily infections could hit 26,600 a day nationally by mid-January.

Ontario — the only province tracking Omicron’s reproductive rate — has reported that it’s infecting almost two times as many people as the Delta variant.

The Hill,How student loan debt became a crisis,I,"President Biden is under mounting pressure to address the student loan debt crisis with lawmakers urging him to issue blanket forgiveness. However, outstanding loan debt is only one part of the problem as soaring tuition costs and an increasing availability to federal loans continues to drive the crisis. 

The student debt crisis so far has led 43 million borrowers to collectively owe around $1.6 trillion. Some of the main drivers of that growing debt are rising tuition costs and increased federal loan availability — further exacerbated by corresponding wage stagnation. 

Tuition costs are a crisis of their own, something former Secretary of Education William J. Bennett foresaw decades ago in 1987. Bennett argued in an opinion piece that “increases in financial aid in recent years have enabled colleges and universities to blithely raise their tuitions, confident that federal loan subsidies would help cushion the increase.” 

A pandemic-related freeze on student loan payments beginning in March 2020 has now been extended five times across two administrations, and lawmakers are calling on the president to again extend the moratorium set to expire May 1. Democratic lawmakers have also argued that not extending the pause is a risky maneuver during a midterm election year.  

Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) recently called on the president to cancel up to $50,000 worth of loans per borrower as the costs of food and gas rise amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but Jayapal upped the ante on Sunday urging Biden to cancel all student debt.  

“Extending the payment pause just isn’t enough,” Jayapal wrote on Twitter. “We need to cancel every last penny of student debt, once and for all.”

Tackling current outstanding debt may ease the financial burden for millions of borrowers, freeing up income to purchase a car or invest in a home. However, that move would not prevent future borrowers from entering into the same debt crisis.  

Collective student debt increased by 144 percent over a 13-year period from 2007 to 2020, moving from $642 billion to $1.566 trillion, according to a 2020 report published by the Bipartisan Policy Center (BPC). During the same period the number of borrowers increased from 28 million to 43 million. The report ties both issues partly to the rise in unemployment caused by the Great Recession beginning in 2007. 

The recession led to policy shifts, including an expansion of the Federal Direct Loan program. Before the overhaul, most federal loans were handled by private lenders with the federal government footing the bill in case of a default. But Congress expanded the program in 2010, allowing the government to issue all federal loans using funds from the Treasury Department.  

That move proved to be monumental, as it increased access to student loans and created a “vicious cycle of rising tuition and higher debt loads,” BPC explained. With more students gaining access to funding, colleges and universities could begin charging higher tuition prices without any serious drops in enrollment. Published tuition rates at colleges and universities rose by 60 cents for every dollar increase in the annual lending limit for Federal Direct Subsidized Loans.  

That shift saw near-immediate effects, with BPC’s report noting that federal student debt grew to 6.6 percent of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2015, compared to only 3.5 percent in 2007.

Meanwhile, the cost of college has doubled in the past two decades and is growing each year by 6.8 percent according to The Education Data Initiative. Data shows the average cost to attend an in-state public school for one year is $25,487. Students attending private schools pay nearly twice as much as the average single-year cost doling out around $53,217. Both numbers cover tuition, fees and additional expenses.

Yet the price of college has far exceeded the corresponding wage increase by more than 100 percent over the past four decades, according to analysis of education data by Georgetown University last fall. Between 1980 and 2019 college fees rose by 169 percent, while wages for young workers aged 22 to 27 went up by 19 percent over the same period.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) brought the issue to the fore on social media earlier this week, again calling on the president to cancel student debt, an issue he has previously expressed willingness to consider both early in his presidency and on the campaign trail.   

“I graduated from a state school that cost $50 a semester,” Warren wrote on Twitter. “Every person in America should be able to go to college without being crushed by student debt.”  ",https://thehill.com/changing-america/enrichment/education/599377-how-student-loan-debt-became-a-crisis,"

CBR,Morbius: How Marvel Turned the Spider-Man Villain Into a Hero,I,"Morbius, the Living Vampire makes his live-action debut as the next addition to Sony's cinematic Spider-Verse in Morbius. While Morbius might've started out as a tortured villain to the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, the Living Vampire eventually transitioned into a steady role as a lethal supernatural superhero, much like his cinematic counterpart Venom.

In the years leading up to Morbius' creation, the  Comics Code Authority had strict regulations about what kind of content could be featured in comics, including an effective ban on supernatural monsters like vampires. But by the early '70s, the CCA started to relax its rules. With that in mind, outgoing Amazing Spider-Man writer Stan Lee suggested that Roy Thomas and Gil Kane create a vampire villain for Marvel's chief web-slinger. And with Amazing Spider-Man #101, that's exactly what they did with Michael Morbius, who used an experimental serum to cure his blood disorder only to transform into a vampire.

While his origins, like many Marvel characters, were more rooted in science fiction than horror, Morbius appeared in two separate anthology comics series when supernatural characters were popular in the '70s. Morbius appeared in both the black-and-white magazine Vampire Tales, which was published through Marvel's sister company Curtis Magazines, and the more traditional anthology series Adventure into Fear. Appearing sporadically throughout the Marvel Universe, the tragedy of Morbius' condition gained greater emphasis, making him a more sympathetic, tormented antihero who loathed the monster he had become. For the next several years, Morbius returned to a more villainous role. However, Morbius would find his own form of heroic redemption in the '90s.

In his own series and its related titles, Morbius resurfaced to team up with the various supernatural heroes and monsters of the Marvel's Universe, with the ensemble dubbed the Midnight Sons. Formed by Ghost Riders Johnny Blaze and Danny Ketch to combat the demon Lilith and her monstrous offspring, the team consisted of Morbius, the Ghost Riders, Blade, the monster-hunting Hannibal King and eventually Doctor Strange. While the Midnight Sons line mostly failed to take off with readers, Morbius' self-titled series lasted for 32 issues before the Living Vampire returned to his status as a more sporadic hero around the Marvel Universe.

In the late '90s and early '00s, Morbius worked alongside Doctor Strange and Blade to combat traditional supernatural vampires while continuing to battle his own inner darkness. After registering with S.H.I.E.L.D. following Civil War, Morbius assisted the government in combating an attempt by the undead from the Marvel Zombies Universe -- including a zombified version of himself -- from invading the main Marvel Universe and would later form a new incarnation of the Midnight Sons with Werewolf by Knight, Daimon Hellstrom and Man-Thing, to contain future zombie threats.

Recent relaunches of the character had Morbius relocate to Brooklyn, to battle more street-level threats in his own lethal way while occasionally crossing paths with supernatural monsters, most notably in his own short-lived 2013 self-titled series. In his currently ongoing series by Vita Ayala and Marcelo Ferreira, Morbius has continued his efforts to deal with his vampiric affliction with ghastly results that even drew the attention of Spider-Man.

While his battle against his vampiric affliction is still causing him trouble, Morbius is the prime example of a Spider-Man villain who has been able to redeem himself and have that atonement largely remain -- in contrast to Sandman and Doctor Octopus' inabilities to avoid returning to villainy. Like Venom, Morbius is a character that has long succeeded due to his tortured nature and his efforts to balance his more noble qualities with an insatiable thirst for human blood.

New America,The Rooney Rule: The Racist Hiring Practices of the NFL,I,"32 NFL teams
31 NFL team owners
1,696 players on starting rosters
1,183 players of color on those starting rosters
2 African American head coaches
0 African American majority team owners

This is the National Football League.

In 2003, the NFL, commonly known as The Shield, instituted a new policy known as the “Rooney Rule.” Created in an attempt to address the league’s lack of diversity in hiring practices, the rule requires that every NFL team must interview at least one candidate of color for any open head coaching position. Since the rule’s implementation, of the 121 open head coaching positions, there have only been a total of 18 African Americans hired as head coaches.

Brian Flores, one of those 18, was head coach of the Miami Dolphins from 2019 until he was unexpectedly fired earlier this year after three seasons for “organizational strife,” as suggested by team owner Stephen Ross. During his time, Flores led the Dolphins to two consecutive winning seasons — a feat no other coach in Miami has been able to accomplish since 2002. A few weeks after his firing, on Feb. 1, Flores sent shockwaves across the world of sports when he filed a class action lawsuit against the NFL and three teams, Miami Dolphins, Denver Broncos, and New York Giants, alleging racial discrimination in their head coach hiring practices, alongside other damning allegations.

Flores, who interviewed with both the Denver Broncos and the New York Giants for head coaching positions, alleges that then-Broncos General Manager John Elway and two other team executives showed up an hour late to the interview, looking “disheveled” and that “it was obvious they had been heavily drinking the night before.” Flores referred to these interviews as a “sham,” meant only to fulfill the league’s quota in interviewing minority candidates for head coaching positions. Further allegations from Flores accuse the owner of the Miami Dolphins, Stephen Ross, of offering to pay him $100,000 per game to purposely lose games, so that the team could receive a higher draft pick.

We’ve seen these types of allegations before. In 2019, former head coach of the Cleveland Browns Hue Jackson alleged that the bonuses he was paid were for losing games and that the team didn't make an effort to develop or acquire players to improve the team. Both team owners Stephen Ross and Jimmy Haslam have denied these accusations. One particular theory to explain the claims of Jackson and Flores, known as the “glass cliff theory” argues that “members of underrepresented groups are most likely to be hired by organizations that have a history of poor performance or that are in crisis.” In other words, both Jackson and Flores were both hired by teams with a history of poor performances, in order to take the fall.

Flores’s situation exemplifies how people of color, and African American coaches in particular, are treated as the most expendable and the most undervalued when it comes to leadership roles. So why is it, in a league with majority African American talent in playing positions (71% in the 2021 season), that African American coaches are routinely overlooked, coerced to fail on purpose, or dismissed? Brian Flores’s lawsuit has exposed the widespread discontent among African American and POC coaches over NFL hiring practices.

But these racist hiring practices are not just limited to the NFL. In a controversial television interview in April 1986, Al Campanais, the then-vice president and director of player personnel of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team, infamously said that, “They [Black people] may not have the necessities to be a field manager or perhaps a general manager.” This type of myopic thinking has been passed along for generations throughout various sporting leagues. Similar to the Rooney Rule, Major League Baseball (MLB) instituted the “Selig Rule” in 1999, requiring at least one minority candidate to be interviewed for every managerial or front office opening. The MLB is still a majority white sport, and the rule has made candidates of color feel like a box to check off rather than a real option.

So why is it, in a league with majority African American talent in playing positions… that African American coaches are routinely overlooked, coerced to fail on purpose, or dismissed?
The National Basketball Association (NBA), another majority African American player league at approximately 73 percent, currently has only one African American majority team owner: Michael Jordan. Jordan was preceded as majority team owner by Robert Johnson, the founder of Black Entertainment Television, as the first African American majority owner in the NBA. Comparatively, the NFL does not have a single African American majority team owner. And the racial injustices are perpetuated on all levels, not only within the team’s coaching and managerial staffs. Players also face discriminatory treatment. There is unmentioned conventional thinking that athletes of color should just shut up and play the game, or just be happy that they are making large sums of money, and they shouldn’t use their status or voice to advocate for an injustice, preserving the laborer-vs.-owner mentality.

Colin Kaepernick sacrificed his NFL career in order to speak out against injustice, while playing in a league that practiced inequality in its hiring. Not only are current players mistreated, former players also experience continued racism when it comes to medical settlements for injuries sustained during their playing years. In June of 2021, the NFL finally agreed to stop the controversial practice of ""race norming,"" which assumed that African American athletes started with lower cognitive functions than white athletes. The NFL’s use of race norming made headlines last summer when two former players filed a lawsuit against the NFL for its application to concussion settlements for former players. African American players were deliberately paid less for brain diseases developed as a result of prolonged head injuries sustained from the sport because doctors applied “African American normative corrections” to players’ cognitive function tests.

Since his firing and filing his lawsuit, Brian Flores has been hired by the Pittsburgh Steelers as a senior defensive assistant and linebackers coach, joining one of the few Black head coaches in the league, Mike Tomlin. But even with this new role, one that he is surely overqualified for, Flores plans to move forward with the lawsuit “so that real change can be made.”

When will this end? Will Flores’s lawsuit bring about actual change? In sports there are so many instances of a system that keeps allowing white men to dominate all spaces, including predominantly POC spaces. Systemic racism that is perpetuated through societal norms is reflected in our country’s biggest sporting leagues, from the NFL to the NCAA, to the National Hockey League, professional golf, NASCAR, and more.

At its core, the agenda of the league and its owners is clear: a desire for financial gain and to keep an unrelenting grip on power that continuously reinforces and widens the wealth and class gap in this country.

This is the world of sports, this is the NFL, this is The Shield.

The Shield has been tarnished.",https://www.newamerica.org/the-thread/the-rooney-rule-didnt-solve-the-nfls-hiring-issues/,"Flores, who interviewed with both the Denver Broncos and the New York Giants for head coaching positions, alleges that then-Broncos General Manager John Elway and two other team executives showed up an hour late to the interview, looking “disheveled” and that “it was obvious they had been heavily drinking the night before.” Flores referred to these interviews as a “sham,” meant only to fulfill the league’s quota in interviewing minority candidates for head coaching positions. Further allegations from Flores accuse the owner of the Miami Dolphins, Stephen Ross, of offering to pay him $100,000 per game to purposely lose games, so that the team could receive a higher draft pick.

Screenrant,What Will Smith Resigning From The Academy Actually Means,I,"Will Smith has officially resigned membership in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts of Sciences, and here's what that actually means. Smith has certainly had quite the controversial week since his appearance at the 2022 Oscars ceremony. Theoretically, it should have been the most triumphant period of Smith's career, as he finally received an Academy Award for his work, after being nominated previously for Ali and The Pursuit of Happyness.

Instead, Smith's Oscar win has been overshadowed by debate and discussion concerning Smith's actions prior to winning Best Actor. While the ceremony was airing live, presenter Chris Rock made a joke concerning Smith's wife Jada Pinkett Smith, one the couple found to be in poor taste. Smith then walked up to Rock on stage and slapped him in the face. He would then return to his seat, before yelling at Rock and demanding that the comedian not mention his wife.

Smith's behavior has received both defenders and detractors, but the latter group quickly grew large enough to warrant the Academy getting involved. The Academy publicly condemned Smith's actions, before announcing it would initiate further disciplinary hearings. For his part, Smith has publicly apologized to all parties involved, including Rock, and even opted to submit his resignation to the Academy. However, many may now be unsure exactly what Will Smith's resignation from the Academy entails, so here's some clarification.

What Will Smith Resigning From The Academy Means
Since Will Smith submitted his formal resignation as a member to the Academy, Smith has lost two key benefits of his membership. The first is that Smith will no longer be entitled to receive screeners of films, which are sent to Academy members so that they can watch all the nominated movies before casting their votes for who deserves each Oscar. That ties into the second lost benefit: Will Smith also won't be able to vote on who should win Oscars. However, Smith is highly unlikely to actually lose his Oscar, as not even convicted sex offenders Harvey Weinstein and Roman Polanski have had their Oscars rescinded.

Is Will Smith Retiring From Acting?
While it's understandable some might be confused due to Will Smith's resignation from the Academy, there's been indication he plans to retire from acting. The Academy is a powerful organization, but membership in it is by no means a requirement to act in movies. To become a member, an actor must either be sponsored by two existing members or be nominated for an Oscar, which earns automatic membership. Most actors begin working in movies without being members. With that in mind, leaving the Academy shouldn't necessarily place any barriers between Smith and any future movie roles, such as in Warner Bros.' upcoming I Am Legend sequel.

Can Will Smith Still Win Another Oscar?
While it's unlikely Will Smith will be asked to return his Oscar that he earned for starring in King Richard, there is reason to wonder if he will be nominated for future Oscars, at least for a while. Due to the Chris Rock controversy, it's quite possible that no matter how great a performance Smith gives in the near term, the Academy will opt to avoid the potential powder keg nominating him might ignite. At the end of the day though, the Academy is an entirely private organization, and it's in the sole discretion of the Academy's 54-person board of governors to decide whether or not an actor is eligible to be nominated for an Academy Award.

Can Will Smith Rejoin The Academy In The Future?
Will Smith 2022 Oscars after slapping Chris Rock
Similar to deciding whether or not Will Smith can ever be eligible to win another Oscar, the decision of whether or not to ever allow him to re-join the Academy is also entirely up to the Academy's board of governors. Allowing Smith to resume his Academy membership would also likely only be an action taken at a point when the controversy surrounding Will Smith slapping Chris Rock has subsided. In the meantime, the Academy says it still plans to hold a disciplinary hearing regarding Will Smith, and any further measures it takes to penalize the actor may shed light on how likely his eventual return to the Academy is.",https://screenrant.com/what-will-smith-resigning-from-academy-oscars-means-explained/,"What Will Smith Resigning From The Academy Means

Screenrant,Green Lantern Is Secretly Vulnerable To The Last Hero You Think,I,"In the latest issue of DC vs Vampires, Green Lantern severely underestimates a surprising hero, revealing a vulnerability about Hal Jordan that he brutally pays for. Having been bitten and turned into vampires, Green Lantern and Wonder Woman were hunting Green Arrow, Batman, and the Dark Knight's family of vigilantes. What followed was a major blood bath on both sides, one where Green Lantern ultimately didn't come out on top.

Previously in DC vs Vampires, Mary Queen of Blood was murdered, a vampire leader who had been influencing the uneasy peace between vampirekind and humans. Having been replaced with the mysterious Vampire King, a revolution began where an army of vampires began biting and corrupting supervillains. The vampires then turned their attention to the heroes who would threaten them most, such as those with light-based powers like Hal Jordan's Green Lantern. One of the first to be bitten, Jordan began to slowly corrupt the Justice League, turning Wonder Woman into a vampire while killing Barry Allen whose high metabolism would've made the Flash the deadliest vampire of all time, draining the world of blood while the rest of the vampires starved. Now, Batman, Green Arrow, and their families are some of the few heroes still standing, though the Dark Knight had to blow up his Batcave so they could all escape when confronted by the League.

Now, DC vs Vampires #6 from James Tynion IV, Matthew Rosenberg, and Otto Schmidt sees the Bat-Family (and Green Arrow) confronted by the vampires who were once their friends in a nearby safe house. Capturing them all with a construct from his ring, Green Lantern was curious to know what Batman's plan was beyond using sun lamps to slow him and Diana down. However, there was one hero Jordan neglected to capture due to his own assumptions (which Batman was counting on).

Alfred-Cutting-Off-Green-Lantern's-Arm-In-DC-vs-Vampires
Knowing that Alfred would likely escape Jordan's notice, the Bat-Family's faithful butler was able to get up close to Hal, using an axe that had been painted yellow to cut off the Green Lantern's arm. As Batman notes, Jordan assumed that only people in masks would stand up to him, proving a flaw in his line of thinking. While his arrogance can likely be attributed in part to his newfound corruption as a vampire, Green Lantern was also pretty authoritarian before being bitten, coming from a background where he belonged to a very set power structure with the Green Lantern Corps. As such, it's not that surprising that Hal didn't see Alfred Pennyworth as a threat, viewing him more as a civilian than a member of the Bat-Family who's just as willing to fight for those he loves.

Following the loss of his arm thanks to Alfred, Green Lantern was ultimately defeated by Green Arrow who tragically delivered the killing blow to his former best friend-turned-vampire. While a major betrayal and Wonder Woman's survival resulted in only a few heroes making it out of the safehouse alive, Alfred taking down Green Lantern is still quite the impressive feat even though it's happening in an alternate universe. That being said, the vampire revolution is still underway. While the loss of Green Lantern was quite the significant blow, the high cost it took to make it happen might not have been worth it in the latest issue of DC vs Vampires.",https://screenrant.com/green-lantern-alfred-weakness-dc-vs-vampires/,"Alfred-Cutting-Off-Green-Lantern's-Arm-In-DC-vs-Vampires

CBR,Three Hollywood Legends Almost Played the Simpsons' Most Depressing Character,I,"The Simpsons has featured a nearly countless number of guest stars over the years, ranging from sports stars to award-winning actors, but over the course of the show's thirty-plus years on the air, it's also had some performers who turned down what would prove to be iconic roles. Frank Grimes, one of The Simpsons most infamous one-off characters, was ultimately played by series regular Hank Azaria, but before Azaria stepped into the role, three other notable actors were considered for the part.

""Homer's Enemy,"" the finale for The Simpsons' eighth season, was an experimental one for the show creators. Coming at a time when the animated series was becoming more conceptually experimental, ""Homer's Enemy"" focused on Frank Grimes. Played by Azaria, Grimes was designed as a realistic man in the absurd world of The Simpsons. A new employee at the Nuclear Power Plant, he developed an intense dislike for Homer. Eventually enraged to an emotional breaking point by Springfield's acceptance and celebration of Homer, Grimes ended up clutching onto power lines, killing himself. The episode remains a contested one among fans, beloved by some as a darkly perfect subversion of the show and decried by others as the end of the show's golden age.

Originally, the episode wouldn't have featured Azaria in the role. During production on the episode -- which was written by one of the show's most prolific writers, John Swartzwelder -- Grimes was designed after Michael Douglas' character William Foster from the 1993 film Falling Down, which also focused on a mild-mannered man pushed to his limit by the world around him. Although Douglass wasn't contacted by The Simpsons to tackle the role, three other major actors were considered for the part.

One possibility early on was the legendary comedian Steve Martin. As confirmed by Season 8's co-showrunner Bill Oakley in a since-deleted tweet, Martin turned down the part -- but later appeared as Ray Patterson in Season 9's ""Trash of the Titans"" as another straight-man exhausted by Homer.

The producers were also initially interested in pursuing Nicolas Cage for the part -- as confirmed by The Simpsons writer Josh Weinstein on Twitter. However, they ultimately decided to utilize Azaria, reasoning his extensive experience with The Simpsons style of comedy would lend itself well to his exasperated performance as Grimes.

Azaria initially disagreed, arguing that William H. Macy would be the perfect candidate for the part. Ultimately, the producers convinced him otherwise, but as confirmed by Azaria in the commentary for the episode included on the Season 8 DVD set, he eventually based much of his performance on how he imagined Macy would have tackled the part. Like Martin, Macy would also eventually appear as himself in the show in Season 17's ""Homer's Paternity Coot.""

It's an interesting series of possibilities to consider, especially when one remembers Grimes' legacy in the history of the series. Grimes remains one of the show's most controversial characters, and that would have likely only been amplified if the character hadn't been so fully formed around someone who knew the show inside and out. While it's likely all three performers could have brought a fun energy to the character, Azaria proved to be the perfect performer for the part -- bouncing off the rest of the cast with a knowing amount of snark, disbelief, and ultimately horror that benefited the episode. But still, it's fun to imagine the kind of energy that someone like Cage could have brought to the character.",https://www.cbr.com/simpsons-who-played-frank-grimes/,"One possibility early on was the legendary comedian Steve Martin.

Screenrant,Sons of Anarchy: What Happened To Thomas Teller (Jax's Brother),I,"The Teller family kept a lot of secrets throughout Sons of Anarchy, and one of the biggest questions fans were left with was what happened to Thomas Teller, Jax’s brother. Created by Kurt Sutter, Sons of Anarchy premiered on FX in 2008 and was very well received by critics and viewers from the beginning, allowing it to live on for a total of seven seasons, coming to an end in 2014. Sons of Anarchy took viewers into the world of motorcycle clubs, the many conflicts that arise between clubs, and the many tragedies in the personal lives of the members of these groups.

Sons of Anarchy follows Jackson “Jax” Teller (Charlie Hunnam), VP of the motorcycle club Sons of Anarchy in the fictional town of Charming, California. When Jax finds a manifesto written by his late father, John “JT” Teller, one of the founding members of the MC, in which he detailed his plans and vision for the club, he realizes these were very different from those of the current President (and Jax’s stepfather), Clay Morrow (Ron Perlman), sending him on a personal journey that makes him question his path, role in the club, relationships, and more. Along with conflicts within the club and with others as well, Jax also dealt with a lot of family drama as there were many secrets in the Teller clan.

Throughout Sons of Anarchy, many secrets of the Teller family were exposed, and the biggest one was about JT’s death. It was revealed that Clay and Gemma messed with JT’s bike, provoking the accident that led to his death, but Jax was manipulated by Gemma and never learned his mother was involved too. However, there was another tragedy in the Teller family, before JT’s death, that left the audience wondering about it. Jax wasn’t an only child and he had a brother, Thomas Wayne Teller, who died many years prior to the events of Sons of Anarchy, and while the series mentioned why he died, it’s an answer easy to miss and forget.

In the pilot episode of Sons of Anarchy, Jax and Wendy’s son, Abel, is born, but he carries the “family flaw” as he’s born with a heart defect. It’s then explained that Gemma, Jax, and Thomas had it too, and while Gemma had open heart surgery at some point (hence the big scar on her chest), Thomas suffered the consequences of the flaw. Thomas died from this congenital heart condition when he was six years old, and his death heavily impacted the relationship between JT and Gemma. Although Thomas died many years before the events of Sons of Anarchy, he wasn’t forgotten by his family, and his tombstone was shown a couple of times, he was mentioned throughout the series, and Jax named his youngest son after him.

Thomas’ death and the heart defect that affected him, Jax, Gemma, and Abel have also made viewers wonder why Jax didn’t have a scar like Gemma nor did he have any heart issues throughout the series. Fans have concluded that Jax’s condition wasn’t too serious and didn’t need surgery as Gemma and Abel did, while others have gone as far as to theorize that Gemma wasn’t Jax’s mother, and his real one was none other than the Homeless Lady, but that seems like a big stretch. The Teller family in Sons of Anarchy was destined for tragedy, and in the end, the only Tellers left were Jax’s sons, Abel and Thomas, and Jax’s half-sister, Trinity Ashby.",https://screenrant.com/ons-anarchy-thomas-teller-jax-brother-death-condition/,"In the pilot episode of Sons of Anarchy, Jax and Wendy’s son, Abel, is born, but he carries the “family flaw” as he’s born with a heart defect.

Screenrant,X-Files: Every Guest Star Who Later Became Famous Actors,I,"Many future big stars made guest appearances on The X-Files many years before they became household names. While the two realms are much closer in prestige nowadays, back in the 1990s when The X-Files was at its peak, acting in big-screen movies was still definitely seen as a more important gig than working on a TV show. However, everyone has to start their showbiz career somewhere, and for many, appearing in one-off guest-starring roles, bit parts, or as small supporting characters serves as that way in.

While it was one of the shows that helped ease TV dramas toward more serialized storytelling with its famous alien mythology arc, The X-Files was never still very much a ""case of the week"" type procedural for most episodes, leaving the door wide open for different guest stars to shine every time out. Whether those guest stars were playing the local law enforcement officers either assisting or getting in Mulder and Scully's way or the villain of the moment, ample opportunities were provided to stand out on The X-Files.

Presented below are 21 actors and actresses that appeared on The X-Files either before they were famous or before they finally landed that big role that made them a leading performer. Included among the lot are future sitcom stars, future horror icons, and even future Oscar and Emmy-winners. Here's every X-Files guest star that went on to be a big deal.

Tobin Bell
Four years before playing Jigsaw in Saw would make him a horror icon, Tobin Bell guest-starred on the season 7 X-Files episode ""Brand X."" He played a heavy smoker named Darryl Weaver, the only surviving participant of a deadly experiment involving engineered cigarettes.

Jack Black
Long before movies like School of Rock would make him a comedy all-star, Jack Black guest-starred on the X-Files season 3 episode ""D.P.O."" The story focused on a teenage outcast who gains the ability to kill people with lightning. Black played Bart 'Zero' Liquori, friend to the main character, that was until he got struck.

Bryan Cranston
A couple of years before Malcolm in the Middle and a decade before Breaking Bad, Bryan Cranston guest-starred on the X-Files season 7 episode ""Drive."" Cranston played Patrick Crump, a seemingly deranged man who took Mulder hostage but ended up a sympathetic figure, sadly dying in the end. The episode was written by Vince Gilligan and helped Cranston later get the Walter White role.

Michael Emerson
A few years before playing the devious Ben Linus on Lost, future Evil star Michael Emerson guest-starred on the X-Files season 9 episode ""Sunshine Days."" He played Oliver Martin, a man so obsessed with The Brady Bunch that he used his mental abilities to make the family materialize in his home.

Seth Green
Years before projects like the Austin Powers movies and Buffy the Vampire Slayer would make him a star, Seth Green appeared in the X-Files season 1 episode ""Deep Throat."" Green played a stoner kid named Emil, who gives Mulder information on a possible UFO while being treated to a meal.

Laurie Holden
Laurie Holden is the only person discussed here to have more than a guest role on The X-Files, as she recurred as Mulder informant/Syndicate member Marita Covarrubias for several seasons. While this was her first sizable role, her future turn as Andrea on The Walking Dead would make Holden a much bigger deal.

Felicity Huffman
Long before her leading, Emmy-winning role on Desperate Housewives, Felicity Huffman guest-starred in the X-Files season 1 episode ""Ice."" Huffman played a scientist in the episode, which was similar in plot to the classic horror movie The Thing, with a mysterious Antarctic worm taking over people's minds.

Shia LaBeouf
Long before he was arguably more infamous than famous, Shia LaBeouf had a cameo in the X-Files season 7 episode ""The Goldberg Variation."" LaBeouf played a sick child named Richie, whose central character, Henry Weems, was trying desperately to use his seeming power of luck to find a way to cure.

Lucy Liu
Years before she broke out on Ally McBeal or became one of Charlie's Angels, Lucy Liu guest-starred in the X-Files season 3 episode ""Hell Money."" The story involved an underground lottery involving human organs, and Liu plays Kim, a young woman who desperately needed expensive cancer treatment.

Donal Logue
Before starring on Grounded for Life or playing Harvey Bullock on Gotham, Donal Logue was featured in the X-Files season 1 episode ""Squeeze."" It was the first-ever ""Monster of the Week"" episode and focused on liver-eating mutant Eugene Victor Tooms. Logue played jerk FBI agent Tom Colton, who hated Mulder.

Jane Lynch
Prior to her breakout role on Glee making her known primarily as a comedic actress, Jane Lynch guest-starred on the X-Files season 9 episode ""Lord of the Flies."" Lynch played school principal Anne Lokensgard, who hid the dark secret that she was actually a monstrous part-human/part insect creature.

Dean Norris
Many years before high-profile roles on Breaking Bad and Stephen King's Under the Dome made him much more recognizable, Dean Norris appeared in the X-Files season 2 episode ""F. Emasculata."" The story concerned a deadly outbreak at a prison, with Norris playing a U.S. marshal named Tapia.

Aaron Paul
Another future Breaking Bad star, Aaron Paul, guest-starred in the same X-Files season 9 episode Jane Lynch did, ""Lord of the Flies."" Paul played a self-styled teenage daredevil that goes by the hilarious name of ""Sky Commander Winky."" He survived the episode but didn't emerge physically unscathed.

Ryan Reynolds
Decades before becoming an A-list movie star in the likes of Deadpool and Free Guy, Ryan Reynolds guest-starred in the X-Files season 3 episode ""Syzygy."" Reynolds played a high school jock named Jay DeBoom, who actually ended up being the opening kill of the episode, thanks to a pair of witches.

Giovanni Ribisi
Long before appearing in movies like Avatar, Saving Private Ryan, and Lost in Translation, Giovanni Ribisi guest-starred alongside Jack Black in the X-Files season 3 episode ""D.P.O."" Ribisi got the meatier role, playing the titular lightning-powered teenager Darin Peter Oswald.

Tony Shalhoub
While he'd gained some fame in a supporting role on Wings, Tony Shalhoub guest-starred in X-Files season 2 episode ""Soft Light"" many years before he would win multiple Emmys for Monk. Shalhoub played a scientist experimenting with dark matter, which resulted in his shadow itself becoming deadly.

Octavia Spencer
Long before Octavia Spencer became an A-list award-winner, she made a brief appearance on the X-Files season 7 episode ""Millennium,"" which served as a crossover between Millennium and X-Files. Spencer showed up in the bit part of a nurse, also named Octavia.

Danny Trejo
Before roles like Machete made him a bigger name, Danny Trejo guest-starred on the X-Files season 8 episode ""Redrum."" The story had a sci-fi twist, as it focused on a condemned man who was caught in a time loop. As per usual, Trejo played a dangerous killer, although this time, he was stopped by Doggett and Scully.

Luke Wilson
Before movies like Idiocracy and Old School made him widely famous, Luke Wilson appeared in the hilarious  season 5 episode ""Bad Blood."" The story was presented through the different points of view of Mulder and Scully, with Wilson playing a local sheriff that Mulder disliked but Scully appreciated.

Bradley Whitford
Years before his time on The West Wing would make Bradley Whitford a recognizable face on TV, he made a guest appearance on the X-Files season 2 episode ""Firewalker."" The story concerned a volcanic research team who discovered a deadly new life form, with Whitford playing team leader Dr. Daniel Trepkos.

Screenrant,Why True Crime Show Fans Should Watch More Documentaries,I,"Fans of true-crime dramas have a lot to watch these days, including such popular new limited series as The Girl from Plainville, The Dropout, WeCrashed, Super Pumped: The Battle For Uber, and upcoming additions to the trend like The Staircase. These shows depict real stories involving murder trials and corporate scandals concerning allegations of investor fraud and sexual harassment. There is nothing new to the dramatization of true-crime tales ripped from tabloid headlines, but in the past, such stories were fodder for cheap, sensational movie-of-the-week broadcasts on network television. Now they're prestige TV, spotlighting Oscar-caliber talent in front of and behind the camera. In many cases, such as with the reception of The Girl from Plainville and The Dropout, their performances spark awards buzz themselves.

More and more of today's true-crime dramas are also based on stories previously presented in documentary films, docuseries, and podcasts. Some of them even have direct links to the documentary versions. For example, The Girl from Plainville is a Hulu Original about the trial of Michelle Carter (portrayed by Elle Fanning), who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for encouraging her boyfriend to die by suicide. Prior to the making of the series, this same case was the subject of Erin Lee Carr's two-part HBO documentary I Love You, Now Die: The Commonwealth V. Michelle Carter. The director of that doc served as a consulting producer for the dramatic ""remake."" Carr had already experienced seeing her doc subjects turned into dramatic series, having made the HBO documentary Mommy Dead and Dearest, which inspired the Emmy-winning Hulu show The Act.

For the documentary filmmakers, there could be a fear that the dramatic versions will replace the originals, in terms of the appeal for viewers seeking these kinds of stories. True-crime documentaries have seen a boon in popularity in recent years thanks to the surplus of twist-filled features and series acquired or produced by streamers, particularly Netflix. These programs are ripe for discussion at the office water cooler and on social media. However, scripted and acted-out alternatives featuring famous celebrities such as Jared Leto, Amanda Seyfried, and Super Pumped narrator Quentin Tarantino easily draw an even wider audience. That means more people entering the conversation, some of whom wouldn't have watched the docs in the first place. Therefore, the drama series can be seen as additional and supplementary to the docs rather than substitutes.

As with any adaptation, though, it must be stated that familiarity with the source material provides deeper appreciation for the newer form. Books turned into movies don't render the literary original obsolete or less-read. Many people love to compare the multiple versions of stories. Just as traditionally the book is better than the movie, the same is often true of the docs. There tends to be more insight and analysis in the nonfiction medium. And in the process of conforming to the needs of dramatization as it suits a wide audience, many true-crime shows fictionalize a number of events and exclude certain facts and details that don't fit the purposes of entertainment. Viewers can understand and consider more for themselves by looking at the real people and events in a documentary as opposed to the performed and further narrativized interpretations of the dramatic versions.

The same can be said of biographical stories as well, and there is a hope that fans of the film The Eyes of Tammy Faye will now seek out the 2000 documentary of the same name that inspired the new biopic. Jessica Chastain's Oscar-winning portrayal of the titular evangelist is enjoyable and truthful to an extent, but there is nothing like seeing the actual Tammy Faye on screen and all the specifics of her life story. Dramatic movies and series can generate empathy, there's no doubt, yet documentary interviews and other intimate footage of real people put viewers in the shoes of those subjects on a whole other level. It's not necessarily better, just different. When real stories are depicted in both formats, a la The Girl from Plainville, true-crime fans, in particular, are able to comprehend and empathize so much more than they would through watching just one or the other.

CBR,Is Fox's Welcome to Flatch Proof that the Mockumentary Sitcom is Dead?,I,"FOX's newest sitcom Welcome to Flatch is trying to reach the the same popularity as fan-favorite mockumentaries The Office and Parks and Recreation -- but so far it's planted itself at the bottom of TV ratings. Many people don't even know what the show is about. While there could be several feasible reasons for its poor performance, it also serves as a sign that the mockumentary sitcom trend has gone on just a bit too long.

With other mockumentaries like What We Do in the Shadows still scoring well with audiences and getting one star cast in the Blue Beetle film, the overall mockumentary style can still find success. But the FX show adds a twist to the standard sitcom blueprint by not trying to make the fictional scenario appear too real. Using vampires as the subject matter makes the show more of a supernatural comedy, as opposed to a reality TV-style documentary.

Flatch, on the other hand, seems to be trying to find a balance somewhere between the dry humor of The Office coupled with the ridiculous realities of small-town America that gained popularity through Schitt's Creek (featuring Super Bowl ad star Eugene Levy). While the concept sounds promising, Flatch tries too hard to steep its plots and characters in reality. Today's comedy audiences are responding more favorably to extreme caricatures, rather than shows built upon mocking the lifestyles of seemingly real-world Americans.

The lack of interest may also be tied to bad timing and political tensions between Americans today. The Office, minus a few plots that would be considered controversial now, could still work if it aired now. The setting was neutral and familiar to most people in the working world, depicting characters from all corners of the country with varying personality types.

Flatch is focused solely on rural America, and while the fictional town of Flatch does have a few charms, it's unclear whether the series is trying to advocate for the current trend of leaving city life for a simpler life in the country (as the opener of every episode likes to remind viewers) or trying to warn would-be transplants to stay far, far away. Minus the two characters who moved to Flatch from the city, every lead in the show is rude, selfish, narrow-minded and often lacking in education, making it difficult for liberal viewers to sympathize with the characters and coming off as outright insulting to the conservative side.

Fox's tactic of releasing half the season on Hulu may help audiences connect with the characters a little faster, but it might not be enough to save the show from a quick cancellation. With viewers oversaturated by popular reality series on Netflix and quick-form reality on social media, they don't need to seek reality out in their comedies anymore. If Flatch wants to succeed, the series should consider stepping up the ridiculousness of its characters to the point where everyone can laugh at the situations they get themselves into. This should be an easy enough feat to pull off if the writers allow their greatest comedic asset -- Seann William Scott -- to unleash his full acting style, as opposed to being stunted by playing the strait-laced preacher.

Welcome to Flatch's creative team needs to face the fact that the rules of the mockumentary sitcom are outdated. Taking concepts from successful British TV series and twisting them to fit American themes doesn't work anymore. Shows like Flatch prove that the mockumentary of a few years ago is dying, and unless this sitcom and others like it can adapt to what audiences find entertaining now, that era in sitcoms will quickly come to an end.

CBR,Where Agents of SHIELD Fits Into Your MCU Rewatch,I,"As of March 16, the long-running Marvel series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. officially has a new home on Disney+. That means that there's a whole new reason to kick off another Marvel Cinematic Universe binge session. The only question is, where does Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. fit in to the overall MCU saga?

In the early seasons, there were direct ties between the events happening in the movies and those unfolding on the show. In addition, fallout from the films directly impacted and, in some cases, drastically altered the course of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. However, as the series progressed, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. slowly began to diverge from the MCU timeline. Eventually, that divergence became quite literal, as the final season of the show saw the titular agents traveling to different time periods, from the 1930s onward. This was done by the Agents writers as a means of having the show avoid the events of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. But now, viewers planning an all-in MCU binge are trying to piece together where Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s seven seasons dovetail with the adventures of the big screen heroes. This guide may offer some assistance.

As noted, the first couple of seasons of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. make for a pretty smooth shared viewing experience, with direct references to the MCU throughout. Following the split between Marvel Television and Marvel Studios in 2015, the threads connecting the two franchises became more and more tenuous. For example, the sixth season does not reference the aftermath of Thano's galaxy-halving finger snap. The show's seventh and final season took things even further by throwing the characters nearly 90 years into the past, leapfrogging over the MCU entirely. However, even with the shaky continuity, there's still enough material for viewers to stitch together a pretty comprehensive viewing experience. Here's a breakdown of how Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the MCU link up.

Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Season 1, Episodes 1-7
Iron Man 3
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Season 1, Episodes 8-16

Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Season 5, Episodes 19-22
Ant-Man and the Wasp
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Season 6, Episodes 1-13
Avengers: Endgame
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Season 7, Episodes 1-13

The seventh season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is the wild card when it comes to an MCU rewatch. The season begins with the agents traveling back to 1931, over a decade before Steve Rogers undergoes his super serum enhancement. Additionally, the season takes place in an alternate timeline from the MCU. For example, in Episode 5, ""A Trout in the Milk,"" the events of Captain America: The Winter Soldier, specifically Project Insight, are seen as having taken place in the 1970s. But, for those wishing to work the movies into a Season 7 binge, Captain America: The First Avenger would theoretically take place between the second and third episodes of that season.

The truth behind the somewhat sketchy connections to the MCU following Season 5 is that the writers of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. did not expect the show to go two more seasons and were simply trying to catch up to a radically changed MCU in the wake of Thanos's snap, later referred to as ""The Blip"" in Marvel canon. The problems become particularly evident during the show's sixth season, where the Blip is not referenced at all and the characters seem unaffected by the events of Infinity War, despite the season taking place one year after Season 5. Still, a little suspension of disbelief can go a long way, and the problem corrects itself by Season 7 thanks to the time jump.

With Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the collected Netflix series, now called the ""Defenders Saga,"" all under one roof at Disney+, it remains to be seen how, or if, the characters from these series will reappear in the MCU. Both Hawkeye and Spider-Man: No Way Home saw the return of two characters from Daredevil, so anything is possible. If Phil Coulson and his agents are going to be brought back into the larger universe, now is the perfect time to get caught up on their adventures.

CBR,Why Jesse Williams Left Grey's Anatomy,I,"Grey's Anatomy has lost many characters since the show's premiere, but some cast members' exits have stung more than others -- like Jesse Williams' departure during Season 17. Williams had played Dr. Jackson Avery on the ABC series since Season 6, when Avery arrived as a surgical resident shortly after the merger between Mercy West Medical Center and Seattle Grace Hospital. He was promoted from recurring cast to series regular in Season 7, meaning that he spent a full ten seasons in the main cast.

By that point, Williams had become a cornerstone of the series, so why did he leave? Was it another case of the Grey's Anatomy writers opting to get rid of a character (one of the reasons why the show may have overstayed its welcome and shouldn't continue without Ellen Pompeo), or did the actor decide that ten seasons was enough time to spend on one character? Here's the story behind Jackson Avery's time on Grey's Anatomy and the reason why he moved on.

Who Was Jackson Avery On Grey's Anatomy?
Avery started his Grey's Anatomy tenure working with chief of plastic surgery Mark Sloan, until Sloan's death in a tragic plane crash during the Season 8 finale. It was also in Season 8 that Avery and fellow doctor April Kepner (played by Sarah Drew) began their tumultuous relationship. After many ups and downs, the pair secretly married and lost their newborn son to Osteogenesis Imperfecta Type 2 shortly after their wedding. In an effort to grieve her son's death, Kepner joined the Army in Season 11 and became a trauma surgeon alongside Dr. Owen Hunt. Soon after she returned, Kepner and Very began having problems and ultimately divorced -- although she revealed she was pregnant again after the divorce was finalized.

After their divorce, Avery reconnected with his father and inherited almost $1 billion after his famed grandfather Harper Avery passed away. He also had short-lived relationships with Maggie Pierce and Jo Wilson before he decided to reunite with his former wife and their daughter Harriet. Williams left the long-running medical drama after the reconciled family moved to Boston to work on the Harper Avery Foundation during the Season 17 episode ""Tradition.""

Why Jesse Williams Left Grey's Anatomy
Much like his character, Jesse Williams was ready to try something new. Williams' Grey's Anatomy contract came to a close, and the actor decided against renewing it. ""I needed to get out of my comfort zone, I needed to go into a very unknown place,"" he said in a New York Times profile. Williams definitely got out of his comfort zone when he accepted a leading role in the new Broadway revival of Take Me Out, playing fictional mixed-race baseball star named Darren Lemming, who comes out as gay to his teammates.

Since Avery wasn't killed off, Grey's Anatomy left Williams an opportunity to guest star in future seasons, which he has yet to do given that it's only been one season since he left. His reasons for walking away from the series are completely understandable, since he played Jackson Avery for longer than some entire TV series go on. With Grey's renewed for at least Season 19, there's still a chance the fan-favorite will be back someday.",https://www.cbr.com/greys-anatomy-why-jesse-williams-left/,"Why Jesse Williams Left Grey's Anatomy

Comicbook,Did Marvel Just Hint Blade's Daughter Is Headed to the MCU?,I,"Each of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's upcoming movies and television shows are spotlighting a different corner of the Marvel universe, ranging from established tenets of comic canon to newly-created additions. One upcoming installment to that will be a new feature film for Blade, which will star Mahershala Ali as the titular vampire-killing daywalker. While the project was announced all the way back in 2019, subsequent updates have been scattered in the time since, as a director, writer, and members of the supporting cast have begun to be announced. That has left a lot of room for speculation about what story the Blade movie could tell, particularly to differentiate itself from the Wesley Snipes-led Blade movies of the '00s. One prevalent theory has been that Marvel Studios' Blade movie could be a multigenerational story with both Blade and his daughter — something that a new move from Marvel Comics itself might have just forecast.

On Friday, Marvel announced its plans for the annual Free Comic Book Day event, including more details surrounding the Free Comic Book Day: Avengers/X-Men #1 special. Particularly, the publisher revealed that a new character named Bloodline will make her debut in a story from Danny Lore and Karen S. Darboe — and that she will be Brielle, the daughter of Eric Cross Brooks / Blade. This piqued the interest of Blade-savvy Marvel fans on multiple levels, particularly since Marvel had originally planned to introduce a daughter of Blade during their All-New, All-Different Marvel initiative in 2015. The Blade the Hunter series, which would have been from Tim Seeley and Logan Faerber, would have followed Fallon Grey, a popular 16-year-old from rural Oregon who learns that she is Blade's daughter when supernatural trouble finds its way to her rural home. The project ultimately never came to fruition, but fans remained eager to see the character introduced in some capacity, even before Ali was cast as Blade himself. Some had speculated that Fallon could be the focus of a Blade project for Marvel Studios, with Snipes returning as an older version of his character to mentor her.

With Ali now definitely tied to the Blade reboot (and already having made his debut in the MCU), the possibility of seeing his daughter onscreen has only further intrigued fans, especially as there's no telling what corners of the supernatural Marvel lore the film could weave in. This hype only grew with a rumored casting description in that seemed to heavily tease Blade's daughter, with the project seeking Ruby, a teenage girl who is ""thoughtful, serious, and burdened by growing up in a complex world."" 

Of course, the nature of bringing Blade's daughter into the Marvel Cinematic Universe would be a unique one — while it's an idea fans have campaigned to see realized in live-action for several years now, it has no roots in any actual comic, with the teasers for Seeley and Faerber's Blade the Hunter being the only thing that was actually published. Given the fact that Fallon Grey never appeared in the comics, it would also potentially make the nature of attributing credit for her creation a little complicated, something that Marvel has dealt with time and time again with its adaptations. And beyond that, if Blade's daughter were to be introduced in the Blade film before making her comic debut, it would create a void (both narratively and financially, given the nature of the comic book market) of fans wanting to read comics about her, but not being able to easily do so.

Enter Brielle / Bloodline, a new take on the concept of Blade having a daughter, originating in a story that from a diverse creative team and will be released well before the new Blade movie might even begin production, much less be released to general audiences. While there's always a chance that that could be a genuine coincidence, we've seen countless examples of Marvel tailoring elements of the comics to match film or television adaptations — just look at the new Captain Carter book that spun out of the character's popularity on What If...? or the recent relaunch of Shang-Chi as very recent instances. At the moment, there's no telling what the future holds for Bloodline, but it certainly wouldn't be surprising if her comic debut is setting up a larger presence sooner than later.

Comicbook,"Top 10 Comic Books Rising In Value In The Last Week Include Nova, Ghost Rider & more",I,"Like last week, this week's Top 10 features a mix of new and repeat entries. Repeat entries include the first appearance of Silver Sable, driven by speculation of her appearing in Sony Picture's KRAVEN film and George Perez's classic JLA/AVENGERS Heroes Initiative trade paperback reprint (A reminder to please donate to this fantastic charity that gives back to the creators we love in the comic book industry). The rest of the list all feature books that have appeared on our Top 10 within the past year. Many of these are directly tied to content speculation. For example, the first appearance of Marvel's Ghost Rider led Midnight Sons and Emilia Clarke rumors of playing Veranke the Skrull Queen. Obi-Wans' first appearance reappears with excitement building for his May Disney+ series. '80s animated series favorite, Voltron, is being developed for a feature film, helping his first comic appearance to land on this list for the first time. Lastly, the confirmation that Moon Knight writer Sabir Pirzada is writing a NOVA project for Marvel helped the first appearances of young Nova corp member Sam Alexander and veteran corp member/ Marvel Icon Richard Rider to dominate this week's Top 10. 

Want to know what comic books are trending each week and why? COVRPRICE.COM uses live sales analytics to identify and compile the most robust market price guide, highlighting the top trending comics each week. No opinions. Just data. Each week, they present a newly updated list of the TOP 10 COMICS. These trends are due to rumors, fan-favorite covers, story-driven content, and content-related news.

#10: AMAZING SPIDER-MAN #265 | MARVEL | 1985 | It's rumored that actor Christopher Abbott will be playing The Foreigner in Sony's KRAVEN film. In the comics, The Foreigner was formerly Married to Silver Sable, and this connection has allowed speculators to believe that Silver Sable may also appear in the film. Her first appearance in this issue had a high sale of $690 for a CGC 9.8 with raw copies trending at an FMV of $93. 

#9: STAR WARS #2 | MARVEL | 1977 | Obi-Wan's Disney+ series' May release isn't too far away. While we wait, his first comic book appearance continues to get more attention. Last week, we tracked a high sale of $810 for a CGC 9.6, with a raw FMV of $82. 

#8: POINT ONE #1 NICK BRADSHAW VARIANT | MARVEL | 2011 | Speculation is still holding out that the Sam Alexander version of Nova will appear in the recently announced MCU Nova project with Moon Knight writer Sabir Pirzada. The current rumor is that the show/film will feature BOTH Richard Rider and Sam Alexander. With Sam's first appearance in this issue of Marvel Point One #1 (2011), collectors are divided between the regular cover and this variant. Since Sam doesn't appear on either cover (Richard Rider appears in the background of the standard cover), it's merely a matter of which one you like more. This Bradshaw variant had a high sale of $350 for a CGC 9.8 and a raw FMV of $88.

#7: JLA/AVENGERS HERO INITIATIVE TPB | MARVEL/DC | 2022 | The recent health concerns around George Perez have spotlighted the need for us, as a community, to contribute to vital organizations like the Hero Initiative. The Hero Initiative was created as a charity dedicated to helping comic book creators in medical or financial need. George Perez, a founding board member himself, is an example of a comic book creator whom this charity would directly benefit from. Marvel & DC came back together to reprint this classic crossover in a trade paperback limited to 7000 copies. It lands on this week's list in the same spot as last week, with 49 copies sold at a 7-day trend of 91% and a high sale of $380 for a raw copy. However, the fair market value is currently trending at $247. Once again, we ask for those reselling their copy to consider donating a portion of those profits to the Hero Initiative. Many sellers are doing so, with many contributing all of their earnings, which is fantastic. Initially costing $30, this book intended to benefit the charity rather than create a rare exclusive with aftermarket value. Suppose we can work together to share these aftermarket sales. In that case, this limited TPB will be an even more significant success by increasing those initial funds raised and giving directly back to the creators we love. 

#6: GHOST RIDER #31 | MARVEL | 1992 | Over the past several years, there have been constant rumors and speculation that a Danny Ketch-led Midnight Sons is in development for Disney+. When another online source mentions the Midnight Sons, this and issue #28, the first cameo appearance of The Midnight Sons (via a future premonition), both begin to move in the aftermarket. Over the past few years, the market has favored issue #28. However, this week it's all about their first full appearance in Ghost Rider #31, which had a high sale of $400 for a CGC 9.8 with raws trending at an FMV of $28. 

#5: VOLTRON #1 | MARVEL | 1985 | Per Hollywood Reporter, a ""Live-Action 'Voltron' Movie, With Rawson Marshall Thurber to Direct, Ignites Bidding War."" This news immediately lit a fire under Voltron's first appearance in comic books. We've tracked a high sale of $665 for a CGC 9.8 with raws at an FMV of $110. 

#4: SECRET WARS II #3 | MARVEL | 1985 | This issue features the first cover appearance and first full appearance of the Beyonder (in human form). This week, in anticipation of his appearance (played by Lawernce Fishburne) in the MOON GIRL AND DEVIL DINOSAUR series, it reached a high sale of $149 for a CGC 9.8 with raws at an FMV of $21. 

#3: POINT ONE #1 | MARVEL | 2011 | As noted, there are rumors that both the Richard Rider and Sam Alexandar versions of Nova may appear together in the NOVA MCU project. Like the Bradshaw variant, this standard cover of Sam's first appearance is trending. However, it out-sold the variant with a higher sale of $400 for a CGC 9.8 and raws at an FMV of $46.

#2: NOVA #1 | MARVEL | 1976 | Also, while Sam Alexander is unconfirmed, Richard Rider's Nova is almost a sure thing in the upcoming NOVA project. His first appearance in this issue has been trending ever since Kevin Feige first mentioned it several years ago. This issue is now on fire with an official confirmation at a high sale of $3000 for a CGC 9.8 and raws trending at $169. 

#1: NEW AVENGERS #40 | MARVEL | 2008 | Several online sources claim that Emilia Clarke is definitely playing Veranke the Skrull Queen. While this remains unconfirmed, these renewed rumors lit a fire on Veranke's first appearance in this issue, with a high sale of $392 for a CGC 9.8 and raws trending at $43. Note: If you're looking for copies at your LCS or at conventions, there's a second print of this issue that's selling for close to $200 raw. Happy Hunting!",https://comicbook.com/comics/news/top-10-comic-books-rising-in-value-in-the-last-week-include-nova-ghost-rider-more/,"#10: AMAZING SPIDER-MAN #265 | MARVEL | 1985 | It's rumored that actor Christopher Abbott will be playing The Foreigner in Sony's KRAVEN film. In the comics, The Foreigner was formerly Married to Silver Sable, and this connection has allowed speculators to believe that Silver Sable may also appear in the film. Her first appearance in this issue had a high sale of $690 for a CGC 9.8 with raw copies trending at an FMV of $93. 

#9: STAR WARS #2 | MARVEL | 1977 | Obi-Wan's Disney+ series' May release isn't too far away. While we wait, his first comic book appearance continues to get more attention. Last week, we tracked a high sale of $810 for a CGC 9.6, with a raw FMV of $82. 

#8: POINT ONE #1 NICK BRADSHAW VARIANT | MARVEL | 2011 | Speculation is still holding out that the Sam Alexander version of Nova will appear in the recently announced MCU Nova project with Moon Knight writer Sabir Pirzada. The current rumor is that the show/film will feature BOTH Richard Rider and Sam Alexander. With Sam's first appearance in this issue of Marvel Point One #1 (2011), collectors are divided between the regular cover and this variant. Since Sam doesn't appear on either cover (Richard Rider appears in the background of the standard cover), it's merely a matter of which one you like more. This Bradshaw variant had a high sale of $350 for a CGC 9.8 and a raw FMV of $88.

#7: JLA/AVENGERS HERO INITIATIVE TPB | MARVEL/DC | 2022 | The recent health concerns around George Perez have spotlighted the need for us, as a community, to contribute to vital organizations like the Hero Initiative. The Hero Initiative was created as a charity dedicated to helping comic book creators in medical or financial need. George Perez, a founding board member himself, is an example of a comic book creator whom this charity would directly benefit from. Marvel & DC came back together to reprint this classic crossover in a trade paperback limited to 7000 copies. It lands on this week's list in the same spot as last week, with 49 copies sold at a 7-day trend of 91% and a high sale of $380 for a raw copy. However, the fair market value is currently trending at $247. Once again, we ask for those reselling their copy to consider donating a portion of those profits to the Hero Initiative. Many sellers are doing so, with many contributing all of their earnings, which is fantastic. Initially costing $30, this book intended to benefit the charity rather than create a rare exclusive with aftermarket value. Suppose we can work together to share these aftermarket sales. In that case, this limited TPB will be an even more significant success by increasing those initial funds raised and giving directly back to the creators we love. 

#6: GHOST RIDER #31 | MARVEL | 1992 | Over the past several years, there have been constant rumors and speculation that a Danny Ketch-led Midnight Sons is in development for Disney+. When another online source mentions the Midnight Sons, this and issue #28, the first cameo appearance of The Midnight Sons (via a future premonition), both begin to move in the aftermarket. Over the past few years, the market has favored issue #28. However, this week it's all about their first full appearance in Ghost Rider #31, which had a high sale of $400 for a CGC 9.8 with raws trending at an FMV of $28. 

#5: VOLTRON #1 | MARVEL | 1985 | Per Hollywood Reporter, a ""Live-Action 'Voltron' Movie, With Rawson Marshall Thurber to Direct, Ignites Bidding War."" This news immediately lit a fire under Voltron's first appearance in comic books. We've tracked a high sale of $665 for a CGC 9.8 with raws at an FMV of $110. 

#4: SECRET WARS II #3 | MARVEL | 1985 | This issue features the first cover appearance and first full appearance of the Beyonder (in human form). This week, in anticipation of his appearance (played by Lawernce Fishburne) in the MOON GIRL AND DEVIL DINOSAUR series, it reached a high sale of $149 for a CGC 9.8 with raws at an FMV of $21. 

#3: POINT ONE #1 | MARVEL | 2011 | As noted, there are rumors that both the Richard Rider and Sam Alexandar versions of Nova may appear together in the NOVA MCU project. Like the Bradshaw variant, this standard cover of Sam's first appearance is trending. However, it out-sold the variant with a higher sale of $400 for a CGC 9.8 and raws at an FMV of $46.

#2: NOVA #1 | MARVEL | 1976 | Also, while Sam Alexander is unconfirmed, Richard Rider's Nova is almost a sure thing in the upcoming NOVA project. His first appearance in this issue has been trending ever since Kevin Feige first mentioned it several years ago. This issue is now on fire with an official confirmation at a high sale of $3000 for a CGC 9.8 and raws trending at $169.

NBC News,8 money moves to make before you retire,I,"Most of us save for retirement for much of our adult lives. Yet as it gets closer, many of us don’t feel prepared for our post-work chapter.

Because retirement is both a mental and a financial transition, you may want to find a qualified financial advisor to work with. A good one will encourage you to think about your lifestyle—where you want to live, if you’ll need to downsize, how you’ll spend your time. The latter is often overlooked, many FAs report, but it’s no less vital: boredom or depression can set in for those whose only goal is to not work.

The primary benefit of an FA, though, is their practical financial advice that will help you make the most of your money during retirement. Here, eight FA-recommended financial moves to make before you bid farewell to your 9-to-5.

1. Calculate your cashflow and create a budget

Tally your “paycheck replacement sources,” suggests Mark Ziety, a CFP at WisMed Financial in Madison, WI. “Retirement income may be a combination of three categories: steady, such as Social Security, pensions and annuities; variable, including dividends, interest, rental income or maturing bonds; and volatile, such as stocks or stock funds.”

When you choose to file for your Social Security benefits—at age 62, at full retirement age, or at 70—will affect the amount of your monthly check for the rest of your life. Decide carefully.

With most plans retirement plans, you can start taking withdrawals as early as 59½ without a penalty. However, you must take Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) from your 401(k), IRA, SEP IRA or SIMPLE IRA when you reach age 72. Roth IRAs do not require withdrawals until after the death of the owner. To avoid error, consult your financial advisor, as these rules can be complicated.

Once you’ve ascertained your sources and how much they may yield, “Estimate your cashflow and create a budget for your retirement years,” suggests Dana Menard, a CFP at Twin Cities Wealth Strategies, Inc., in Maple Grove, MN. Menard, like many FAs, recommends living within your “retirement budget” for a while before making the leap, to ensure you’re comfortable with what you’ve allocated.

2. Estimate your lifetime needs

In addition to a monthly or annual budget, you’ll also need to estimate how long you’ll need your assets to last. These days, more people are living into their 90s and beyond, so longevity in your family and the state of your health are important considerations.

Ask your advisor to estimate how much money you’ll need. Or, figure it yourself using a retirement calculator. Most financial services companies provide them on their websites, offering estimates based on various market scenarios.

Will you have a shortfall? Better to know now, so you can think about how to deal with it, perhaps by working longer.

3. Tidy up your balance sheet

Pay down as much debt as you’re able to. “Eliminating your single biggest monthly expense—your mortgage—will give you a lot of freedom in retirement,” says Matthew Benson, a CFP at Sonmore Financial in Chandler, Arizona. “Pay it off, or at least make a dent.”

Yet, David Mendels, CFP at Creative Financial Concepts in New York, NY suggests one needn’t be in a hurry to pay off their mortgage. “It might be nice to not have to make those payments, but it might well be a whole lot nicer to have the cash,” he says.

In either case, reduce your credit card, student loan or personal loan debt as much as possible before you stop working.

4. Review your investments

Are your retirement accounts at one employer or financial institution? If not, then work with your advisor to locate any old plans and roll the funds over directly to a specified 401(k), IRA or Roth IRA account within 60 days to avoid withholding taxes.

If a previous employer has closed, look for plans dating back to 2010 at the

U.S. Department of Labor. You can also search for your money, which may now be categorized as unclaimed property, at databases such as https://unclaimed.org/ or

missingmoney.com. Both have links to state treasurers, comptrollers and other officials, who update their databases regularly.

Once your accounts are consolidated, your financial advisor can rebalance your portfolio, if needed, and determine if your investment strategy is appropriate for your goals and risk tolerance.

5. Build a cash stash

Just as you need an emergency fund now to cover unexpected expenses and protect your nest egg, the same goes for retirement. Some advisors recommend keeping up to two years of cash to help pay for things in the event the market declines and you don’t want to sell investments, according to Tess Zigo, a CFP at Emerge Wealth Strategies in Palm Harbor, FL.

6. Estimate your taxes

After projecting your retirement income, will your tax bill be higher or lower than it is now? Don’t forget that Social Security benefits are subject to federal taxes, and some states tax them, while others don’t. In addition, you will owe federal and state taxes on any withdrawals from retirement accounts that were funded on a pre-tax basis, such as a 401(k) or an IRA. Contributions to a Roth IRA were made with after-tax income.

7. Plan for healthcare

If you’re determined to retire before 65, when you become eligible for Medicare, you’ll need your own health insurance if you’re not on your spouse’s plan. Once you are eligible for Medicare, know that it doesn’t cover everything and you’ll likely want additional coverage, such as Parts B and D or Medicare Advantage. “Also have a plan for long-term care,” Zigo advises. Someone turning 65 today has an almost 70% chance of needing some type of long-term care services in their remaining years, so it’s important to plan for how you will pay for that support should the need arise.

8. Put other affairs in order

If you pass away or are cognitively incapable of making decisions, it is essential that your affairs are in order. Make sure the beneficiaries of your financial accounts are listed correctly and get an up-to-date will, estate plan and advanced healthcare directive. Designate a personal representative or executor with power of attorney. By doing so, it’s more likely that your wishes will be carried out should the unforeseen occur. Further, you will eliminate any uncertainty that could land your estate in probate for a very long time, causing undue stress on your survivors and potentially eating away at your hard-earned assets.

NBC News,How 'Bridgerton' has helped people lean into their love of the Regency era,I,"Dearest readers, if you're clicking this headline you likely already have swooned over Netflix's ""Bridgerton"" series.

If you’re in Los Angeles, you may have been transported to the Regency era via the immersive Bridgerton experience at the The Millennium Biltmore Hotel’s Crystal Ballroom, which is as fancy as it sounds.

Perhaps you've even watched the reality show dating competition, “The Courtship,"" now on USA Network, which some have described as ""Bridgerton"" meets ""The Bachelor.""

That's because ""Bridgerton,"" which debuted its second season last week, is everywhere. The latest season of the Shondaland-produced show, based on Julia Quinn’s novels, follows Anthony Bridgerton (Jonathan Bailey), the oldest of the Bridgerton siblings, and his love triangle with the Sharma sisters Kate (Simone Ashley) and Edwina (Charithra Chandran).

The weekend after it was released, season two ranked in Netflix's top 10 in 92 countries. It also became the streamer’s most-watched English-language TV title during its premiere weekend.

According to experts, the series' popularity is not a surprise given the obsession with this period of early 19th century British culture.

""Within popular fiction there has been an enduring appeal for romantic stories based in this era, with modern Regency Romance like Julia Quinn’s 'Bridgerton' novels being the most recent examples, but among which we can include earlier writers like Georgette Heyerm"" said Hannah Greig, a professor at the University of York who was a consultant on “Bridgerton,” “The Favourite” and BBC’s “Poldark.""

""And of course Jane Austen’s novels are exciting romances both written and set in the early 1800s, and their appeal is very apparent.""

Stories set in this era have ""long had a global reach and are read and watched around the world,"" Greig said. ""In this way, even though the time period and even the geographical location may be distant, millions of people read about, engage with and enjoy stories set in Regency England.""

And ""Bridgerton"" has reignited the public's interest in all things Regency era.

Take the Queen’s Ball. Hosted by Netflix, Shondaland and Fever, the event — currently in Los Angeles, but launching soon in other cities —invites fans to transport themselves to London in the year 1813.

Guests are encouraged to ""mingle with other members of the Ton,"" aka ""the who’s who of British high society during the Regency era, made up of aristocrats and rich upper-crust gentry and named after the French expression bon ton, or good manners,"" according to Netflix's guide to the ""Bridgerton"" universe.

The event, which was organized during the pandemic, features music, dancing, acrobatic performances, interactive experiences, cocktails and, of course, the ""Bridgerton"" soundtrack.

""'Bridgerton' has seen wonderful viewership and built a wide fan base and we knew that there was an opportunity to allow people to experience the show in a new way,"" said Greg Lombardo, head of experiences at Netflix.

""Shondaland has done a fantastic job with really bringing people into this world in 1800 London and Society and it calls upon a time of romance and beauty and also has that tantalizing effect of scandal and gossip that really pulls people in.""

The goal of the event ""is to bring immersive experiences to 'Bridgerton' fans where they live, and this is a great opportunity to also serve our female audiences,"" Lombardo said.

The other goal? To provide joy, Shondaland executive Sandie Bailey told Insider. ""We all need to treat ourselves to a little bit of joy — especially in recent times.” 

Fans of the Regency era have also recently been able to live vicariously through contestants on ""The Courtship.""

On the show, Miss Nicole Rémy, a heroine looking for her duke, is sent to a castle on the countryside, where she is transported back to Regency-style England, to find her match. Her potential suitors must also win over her court (made up of her family members).

From carriage rides to handwritten letters to communicate, she and her potential suitors are sucked into an immersive romantic experience with the end goal of finding true love and bringing it back to 2022.

""The more I spoke to the producers about the show the more I realized that what 'The Courtship' offers is a romantic antidote to a lot of other dating formats which, much as I watch and adore them, can occasionally feel a bit grubby,"" said host Rick Edwards.

""This show is genuinely sweet and our heroine Miss Remy is treated, quite rightly, like a princess. And the addition of her court — her parents, sister and best friend — has made for some really fun telly.""

Edwards said it makes sense that a show like “The Courtship” was greenlit.

“Given how popular dating shows are, and how popular ‘Bridgerton’ is, it seemed almost inevitable that someone would combine the two,” he said. “We knew that in ‘transporting people back to Regency-era England’ we were doing something quite silly. And I’m glad that we — by which I mean I — had some fun with that.”

When asked why he thinks the Regency era is so popular, Edwards said he thinks ""people love the buttoned-up etiquette, the strict social structures, and then the subversion of both — when you know it’s against the rules, those steamy and illicit liaisons carry even more heft.""

""Without getting too deep, I also think when this genre first emerged, it centered female desires and wants, which would have been unusual and exciting and progressive,"" he said. ""Which is perhaps one the reasons it has endured.""

NBC News,Meet the gamer who raised $400K for transgender rights in Texas,I,"Rue Dickey, who lives in Corvallis, Oregon, said that as a transgender person, they felt helpless watching Texas officials begin to investigate parents of trans children.

Dickey, who uses “they” and “he” pronouns, said they were “having a bit of a crisis” at their day job in marketing when Texas Gov. Greg Abbott ordered the state child protective services agency to pursue child abuse investigations into the parents of transgender children who are suspected of receiving gender-affirming medical care. (Those investigations have since been blocked by a judge.)

Dickey, 25, wanted to do something to help trans youth and their families in the state.

“The lack of things that I can do as a single person was super overwhelming,” they said. That’s when Dickey, who also designs tabletop role-playing games, remembered that Itch.io, a website that sells independent games, held fundraisers for racial justice, Palestinian relief and, more recently, people in Ukraine.

Tabletop role-playing games, such as Dungeons and Dragons, a popular game released in the 1970s, are interactive; players sit around a table and describe their characters' actions, which affect the rest of the game. One player, usually designated the game master, describes the setting of the game and uses a set of rules to give players some structure and guidance. 

Dickey, who has been playing the games for about 10 years and writing them since 2019, decided to gather other game designers and create a bundle of games to sell on Itch.io to benefit two small groups in Texas that support trans people, the Transgender Education Network of Texas and the Organización Latina de Trans en Texas. 

The bundle they created includes 493 games from 300 designers, and it’s on sale until April 3. It’s valued at more than $2,700 but is available through the fundraiser for $5. 

The bundle went live March 2, and Dickey said they initially set the fundraising goal at $1,000. 

Just 45 minutes later, the fund met that goal. So they increased the goal to $5,000, and it was quickly surpassed again.

They went to bed, and the next morning the fund hit $11,000. Since then, they have increased the goal seven more times to $420,000. As of Friday evening, that had raised nearly $394,000.

“I’ve cried probably a dozen times at this point,” Dickey said. They said representatives from both of the organizations have been “super excited” about it. 

“When I first reached out to them, I was like, ‘Hey, we’re hoping to give you at least like $5K each,’ and now every time I email them, I’m like, ‘Hey, just an update, you’re getting $170,000 each now,’” they said, laughing. 

Dickey said both groups have been talking about what they’ll do with the funds, and they have been especially happy to hear what a difference it will make for Organización Latina de Trans en Texas. The trans immigrant-led group runs shelters in cities across Texas and also provides legal support for name changes and navigating the immigration process. 

A representative for the organization told Dickey that the donation will be one of the largest that it has ever received, they said. “It’s going to be enough money for them to do a lot of renovations and revamps to the shelters and things like that, which I’m super excited about.”

Tabletop role-playing games have become increasingly popular among the queer community as the games have become more inclusive. Dickey said that they have two answers for why role-playing games are so popular among trans people in particular.

“My joking answer is that almost all tabletop games have werewolves, vampires, changelings or magic users, and I’ve never met a trans person who doesn’t identify with one of those,” they said. 

On a more serious note, they said that “tabletop role-playing games, at their heart, are about storytelling.” Often, trans people’s stories are told by cisgender people, who identify with their assigned sexes at birth, and are “portrayed by cis actors who don’t understand us and don’t know what we live,” Dickey said. 

Tabletop role-playing games give trans people “the ability to be at our own table and centering ourselves in our stories and getting to play trans characters who the whole through line of their character isn’t that they’re trans, it’s just a part of who they are, and they still have dreams and goals and ambitions, and they’re a part of an adventuring party, they make a difference in the world,” they said. 

“How empowering it is to tell your own story and be a part of a narrative that centers you and your experiences, I think is a lot of what draws at least me and a lot of other trans folks that I know to tabletop games,” they said.

There are a few games in the bundle that Dickey recommends, including their own — “not to toot my own horn,” they joked — called “I Want Your Bite.” The game is based off “The Bachelor,” the dating TV show, “but instead of the bachelor just being a normal person, the bachelor is a vampire,” Dickey said. “So you’re not only competing for their hand, you’re also competing for immortal love.”

They said one of the “big ticket items” in the bundle is a game called “Thirsty Sword Lesbians,” which they described as a “rivals-to-lovers,” high-drama game. They also recommend “Wanderhome,” a fantasy game in which the characters are small animals who defend their home from various threats. 

Dickey said creating the bundle, and now selling 40,000 of them, has brought them a lot of joy amid what’s happening in Texas and the dozens of other states that are considering bills targeting transgender people. 

They hope that trans youth in Texas know that they’re not alone. 

“It’s super important to know that there will always be somewhere that you belong and that the world is duller without you in it,” they said to trans youth. “So don’t let them try to put out the light that is so important that you bring to all the spaces that you’re in.”",https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-community-voices/meet-gamer-raised-400k-transgender-rights-texas-rcna22598,"Rue Dickey, who lives in Corvallis, Oregon, said that as a transgender person, they felt helpless watching Texas officials begin to investigate parents of trans children.

NBC News,Goblin mode' is becoming part of people's everyday vocabulary. Language and meme experts share why.,I,"The term ""goblin mode"" began as a joke. A photo-edited headline falsely claimed that actor Julia Fox split from her ex Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, because he didn't like when she went ""goblin mode.""

""Julia Fox opened up about her 'difficult' relationship with Kanye West: 'He didn't like when I went goblin mode,'"" the fake headline, shared on Twitter by user @meowmeowmeuw on Feb. 15, read. The image also appeared on Reddit around that time.

Goblin mode, which refers to a person who is generally messy, likely unshowered and acting ""feral"" due to laziness or an aversion to going outside, has been used on sites like Tumblr and Urban Dictionary for years. But the recent Fox meme gave the term renewed momentum online.

This cycle of a joke term entering the internet’s vernacular and, sometimes, making the leap into offline vocabulary has become more common. New terms, like ""cheugy,"" are accidentally coined all the time on social media — whether the word is used in earnest or as satire.

Some experts say this happens because words that attach language to something that previously didn’t have an expression have the potential to gain traction.

""If you use a word and people see that it so accurately and succinctly captures the feeling of a moment or a sentiment or a style, then that expression really takes on power, and it's really easy to latch on to,"" Kristen Syrett, an associate professor of linguistics at Rutgers University, said.

Social media is a breeding ground for new words
On Urban Dictionary, an early entry for goblin mode defines it as a term for when a person loses themselves and resorts to becoming a goblin. Some entries describe the term as meaning someone who has become mischievous and goblin-like, while other, more raunchy entries define it as a sex act.

The term has also been widely interpreted as a way to describe someone who is slovenly, unkempt and lazy. While some see it as a harmless way to describe a messy phase, some have suggested the phrase is offensive. One argument is that some people who live with mental health issues or have disabilities are living in ""goblin mode"" not by choice but rather due to circumstance.

The term's wide-ranging definition likely stems from the fact that the Fox meme was a gag that offered no specific definition of what goblin mode meant, leaving it open for interpretation. The vague nature of the phrase, in which people could insert their own definition, is just one way in which social media can birth a new term.

Young people have always been a major driver of language shifts, Syrett said, but social media has been like gasoline on a flame.

""What we see in online communication is a younger generation that has taken control of this medium because it's a way for them to express themselves rapidly in a way that's not defined for them,"" Syrett said.

Memes also frequently invent terminology that becomes part of our regular vocabulary. In addition to goblin mode and cheugy, the insult ""OK boomer"" is a product of memes and the internet.

Those phrases defined the undefinable, which could be why goblin mode went mainstream, Syrett said.

""The fact that you can have a term like goblin mode and have an image that so perfectly captures that ... it just captures it in a way that [feels like] 'I can't define it, but that's what it is,'"" Syrett said.

Although memes are typically meant to be nothing more than jokes, the communication style can sometimes express an abstract feeling that no existing word articulates. So when a meme accidentally uses a word that puts vocabulary to a feeling, it spreads quickly.

""Once you have a word for something, it can be shared. It becomes reality,"" said Shane Tilton, an associate professor of writing and multimedia studies at Ohio Northern University and author of ""Meme Life."" ""It was abstract, and you made it real.""

Will the internet-created terms stick around?
While these phrases may spread rapidly on social media, Syrett said the real test is their staying power. Many words fade away or are relegated to a certain period or niche group on the internet, and they won’t always stand the test of time.

Syrett recalled a debate that members of the American Dialect Society had that focused on that very issue. When selecting a word that would define 2021, some members suggested cheugy encapsulated the year best, while others were furious at the suggestion.

""There was this really dichotomous reaction about that particular word, which was: Is it really a word that people are using, or is it getting used in a way that's not going to allow it to be productive beyond the next year or two?"" she said.

Tilton argued that a phrase like goblin mode, which can apply to many situations in a person's life and may offer a way to describe a feeling or situation that previously had few descriptors, could have more longevity than some might expect.

However, he said it's likely that specific phrase will have cycles, fading in and out of the vernacular.

Language, he said, ""goes as fast and as slow as we can explain our experiences.""",https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/goblin-mode-becoming-part-peoples-everyday-vocabulary-language-meme-ex-rcna22181,"The term ""goblin mode"" began as a joke.

This cycle of a joke term entering the internet’s vernacular and, sometimes, making the leap into offline vocabulary has become more common. New terms, like ""cheugy,"" are accidentally coined all the time on social media — whether the word is used in earnest or as satire.

Some experts say this happens because words that attach language to something that previously didn’t have an expression have the potential to gain traction.

NBC News,The secret to the Ukrainian military’s success,I,"Russia’s awful military performance in Ukraine has been the greatest surprise to emerge from President Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked invasion, confounding military analysts who had observed tactical and technological improvements in the Russian military in preceding years.

By now it’s clear that Putin’s ambition to capture the port of Odesa and the capital of Kyiv in western Ukraine is almost certainly unrealizable, forcing him to drastically downsize his objectives while disingenuously claiming that had been the real intent all along. 

But there’s a flip side to this story: The Ukrainian military has also defied expectations. In the  case of the Ukrainian armed forces, they’ve performed well beyond what was anticipated despite a profound imbalance in military capabilities, particularly in air and naval power and long-distance missiles.

The secret to Ukraine’s success rests first of all on its mindset — one Russia itself has strengthened — backed up by dynamic military strategies that have exploited the weaknesses of a powerful, overconfident adversary. 

For starters, the Ukrainians came into the war with a drastically greater will to fight in defense of their homes and way of life. As Napoleon once put it in explaining factors behind military success, “The moral is to the physical as three is to one.” Accordingly, Ukrainian units are not panicking and evaporating under intense pressure, instead holding out for weeks in besieged cities like Chernihiv and Mariupol. And when facing setbacks, Kyiv’s troops are aggressively and rapidly counterattacking, often checking or reversing Russian gains. 

This spirit has been inflamed by Russia’s brazenly unprovoked invasion. Putin’s onslaught temporarily bridged long-standing divisions between Ukrainian and Russian speakers within Ukraine, as well as between political rivals, creating a unified, coordinated force for confronting the invaders. Even occupied cities with predominantly Russian-speaking populations — which have traditionally been more favorably inclined toward Russia — are actively resisting through civil disobedience and protests.

By comparison, Putin seems to have poorly communicated his intentions and objectives to ordinary Russian soldiers, which didn’t instill a strong commitment to the fight among the rank and file. He spent months ridiculing suggestions that he was preparing for war in Ukraine, claiming deployments around the country were simply military exercises. Now some soldiers appear quick to abandon vehicles or surrender rather than die for a war they’re simply not sold on.

The Ukrainian mental edge was already evident in 2014 and 2015, when Putin started aiding pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine and Ukrainian soldiers resisted so stubbornly they were nicknamed “cyborgs.” By 2021, Ukraine’s military had years of combat experience and were demonstrably stronger thanks to new weapons, military aid and tactics, which is part of why I wasn’t confident that those who doubted how the Ukrainian armed forces would perform in this contest were correct. 

Still, I joined the skeptics in thinking Ukraine’s air force could not long survive vastly superior Russian air power in a full-scale conflict or that ground forces outside of cities could long survive the lack of air cover. But with limited means — just around 100 combat aircraft, less than a tenth of Russia’s more modern force — Ukrainian fighter pilots and ground-based air defenses still contest the airspace over Ukraine, inflicting losses and compelling Russia to use its warplanes less effectively.

One shouldn’t exaggerate: Russia is calculated to be flying a few hundred combat missions daily; Ukraine is averaging less than a dozen, and its air force has suffered important losses. But Russia’s warplanes are relying more and more on inaccurate bombs dropped from high altitude and expensive, limited-supply cruise missiles. When they don’t, Russian jets are getting shot down by short-range missiles, including portable weapons sent by NATO.

To overcome these huge Russian advantages in the sky, Ukraine has waged a guerilla air war of sorts. It apparently dispersed combat aircraft to secondary air bases, or possibly even highways, just before the invasion to avoid their being wiped out on the ground by Russian missile strikes.

Its ground-based air defense batteries, meanwhile, are only briefly activating their radars to ambush Russian warplanes — often aided by a World War II-style network of spotters on the ground — to be harder to track. Kyiv is also reaping dividends from the unmanned aircraft it wisely invested in, picking off Russian fuel transports, command posts and air defense vehicles. Russia’s military is struggling to shoot down these small, slow-flying aircraft, perhaps fearing  their powerful jammers could harm communications with their own planes.   

Ukraine’s military has arguably managed to blend its inherited Soviet-era legacies — abundant artillery and armored vehicles, greater reliance on ground-based air defenses than fighter aircraft — with selected Western advantages such as the practice of empowering noncommissioned and junior officers on the ground to take initiative, and using intelligence to stage precision attacks. These have killed seven Russian generals, according to Ukraine, and devastated a Russian helicopter base.

Notably, stealthy teams of Ukrainian infantry have ably used thousands of portable long-distance anti-tank weapons supplied by the West, as well as manufactured by Ukraine itself, to disable hundreds or more Russian armored vehicles and supply trucks in ambushes and hit-and-run raids. There’s often an instinctive desire to use heavy forces to fight heavy forces, when sometimes well-armed soldiers on foot can do the job better because they’re less likely to be spotted. Ukraine showed foresight in focusing on these types of weapons requests from allies.

Above all, Ukrainian forces have fought asymmetrically: Rather than seeking to stop Russia’s superior might on the border, the Ukrainian leadership has used Ukraine’s sheer geographic expanse as a strength in itself, recognizing that major cities can serve as deadly tar pits for attacking forces. As a result, it’s yielded indefensible open ground while stoutly holding on to densely urbanized areas. Russian troops, therefore, are left with stretched-out and vulnerable lines of supply, with large forces dedicated to surrounding cities they can’t capture to protect these supply lines. To help offset the mismatch further, Ukraine has been highly nimble at distributing imagery of battlefield successes and humanitarian distress to rally Western support.

Of course, it would be wrong to characterize Ukraine’s war effort as flawless. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, for instance, failed to fully mobilize until after Russia initiated hostilities. The political rationale behind this — avoiding giving Putin an excuse for an attack, as well as prematurely damaging the Ukrainian economy — might have been the wrong calculation, since it helped Russian troops rapidly seize three medium-sized cities in southern Ukraine at the onset.

Furthermore, dozens of Ukrainian troops have been killed by Russian missile attacks while sleeping in barracks. Their quarters should have been dispersed. And the coming weeks will test Kyiv’s decision not to pull back veteran brigades from the eastern Donbas region, where they remain at risk of being surrounded by encroaching Russian forces.

Regardless, the Ukrainian military’s conduct should give NATO plenty to learn from. If nothing else, it illustrates to U.S. leaders how a technically inferior adversary can impose surprisingly sharp costs on a seemingly overwhelming foe. Since Vietnam, the U.S. military hasn’t fought a major war with a state-level adversary with highly motivated soldiers and capable military leadership. Ukraine is now providing an object lesson in how and why that’s a dangerous combination to underestimate.

NBC News,The 7 queerest moments from an unforgettable Oscars ceremony,I,"This year’s Oscars began with plenty of controversy — with eight of the 23 categories being presented off-air for the first time and heated debate about how the war in Ukraine should be featured. And it ended with one of the most shocking moments in Academy Awards history, when Will Smith took the stage and slapped presenter Chris Rock.

While the show included its fair share of unforgettable moments, for better and much worse, few involved wins for the many queer-inclusive films nominated for Oscars this year.

Despite “The Power of the Dog” being the most nominated film of the evening, it took home a single statue, to Jane Campion for best director. The second-most nominated film, “Dune,” swept the craft categories, beating out ""The Power of the Dog,"" a gay-themed Western, multiple times and ending the night with six wins. 

“Flee,” which made history with a trifecta of nominations, left the awards empty-handed. The animated documentary about a gay Afghani refugee’s difficult road to starting over in Denmark was beaten out for best animated feature by “Encanto”; for best documentary feature by “Summer of Soul”; and for best international film by “Drive My Car.""

Elsewhere, queer actor Kristen Stewart, nominated for “Spencer,” and Penelope Cruz, nominated for her role opposite Milena Smit in Pedro Almodóvar’s sapphic romance “Parallel Mothers,” were passed over for best actress. “The Mitchells vs. the Machines,” starring Abbi Jacobson as the openly LGBTQ daughter of a dysfunctional family caught up in a robot apocalypse, joined “Flee” in losing out for best animated feature. And Kirsten Dunst ends another award season without an Oscar, after being nominated for best supporting actress in “The Power of the Dog.”

Despite the disappointing showing at the podium, queer culture still left its mark on the evening, from the red carpet to the awards stage. Here are the most notable queer moments from an Oscars ceremony that won’t soon be forgotten.

A power suit redefines the Oscars red carpet
While Kristen Stewart didn’t take home a best actress Oscar for Pablo Larraín’s Princess Diana biopic “Spencer,” she had arguably the best night of any queer actor at the awards. 

Although she was hardly the favorite to win, the first-time nominee whipped up fervent fan support in the run-up to the awards. And, on the red carpet, she gave a masterclass in lesbian-approved formal wear. Accompanied by her fiancée, Dylan Meyer, Stewart arrived at the awards wearing a Chanel custom suit, which included cropped shorts and a diamond and spinel drop necklace in place of a tie. 

In one fell swoop, Stewart and Meyer obliterated the Oscars’ sartorial conventions, which are still defined by gowns and old Hollywood glamor.

Co-hosts take on anti-LGBTQ legislation
After three years without a host, the 94th Academy Awards recruited Wanda Sykes, Regina Hall and Amy Schumer to lead the ceremony. The comedic actors stole the show from the opening monologue, delivering the night’s best one-liners and most pointed political commentary.

In the opener, Sykes, an out lesbian who attended the awards with her wife, kicked off the hosts’ recurring commentary about recent anti-LGBTQ legislation in Florida and Texas: 

“We’re going to have a great night tonight. And for you people in Florida, we’re going to have a gay night.” 

This prompted her fellow hosts to chant “gay,” in defiance of Florida’s controversial Parental Rights in Education bill, dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill by its critics, which Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law on Monday.

Despite a notoriously difficult gig, during a particularly unfunny time, every moment that the hosts were on stage was a welcome one. Sykes, Hall and Schumer dazzled together and solo, landing jokes and refusing to pull punches, going after celebrities and politicians in equal turn.

Ariana DeBose makes queer acting history
Ariana DeBose made history by winning best supporting actress for “West Side Story,” becoming the first openly queer woman of color and the first Afro Latina to win an Academy Award for acting. DeBose, who plays Anita in Steven Spielberg’s remake of the original 1961 film, follows in the footsteps of Rita Moreno, who became the first Latina Oscar winner for the same role.

During her moving acceptance speech, in which she thanked Moreno for paving the way, DeBose delivered a message directed at her younger self: “When you look into her eyes, you see an openly queer woman of color, an Afro Latina, who found her strength in life through art. And that’s what I believe we’re here to celebrate.” 

“So to anybody who’s ever questioned your identity ever, ever, ever or you find yourself living in the gray spaces, I promise you this: There is indeed a place for us,” she added.

DeBose, who was the clear favorite going into the evening, took home the only award for “West Side Story.”

Elliot Page reunites with 'Juno' cast
Fifteen years after “Juno” was released in theaters, Elliot Page reunited with co-stars J. K. Simmons and Jennifer Garner on the Oscars stage. The trio presented the award for best original screenplay, which went to Kenneth Branagh for “Belfast,” the director’s semi-autobiographical film about his childhood in Northern Ireland. 

The reunion marked the 15th anniversary of “Juno,” which earned Page an acting nomination in 2007. Page, who came out as transgender in 2020, remains one of the few openly queer actors to ever be nominated for an Oscar.

'The Power of the Dog' makes it to the podium
Going into the evening, the film about a sexually repressed Montana rancher, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, was likened to “Moonlight,” which took home best picture in 2017. 

But after a stunning 12 nominations, “The Power of the Dog” went home with only one Oscar. It was ultimately beat out by “CODA” for best picture and by “Dune” in many of the other categories, including best cinematography, sound, editing and score.

Campion, the only woman to be nominated twice for best director, became the third woman to win. (Chloe Zhao won last year for “Nomadland,” and Kathryn Bigelow won in 2010 for “Hurt Locker."")

In her acceptance speech, Campion thanked Thomas Savage, who wrote the 1967 novel that the film is based on: “It would be impossible without the man I never met, Thomas Savage. He wrote about cruelty, wanting the opposite, kindness.”

Jessica Chastain addresses LGBTQ issues
The producer and star of “The Eyes of Tammy Faye” was the clear front-runner for best actress going into the evening, following her success at the Critics' Choice and Screen Actor Guild awards. But, despite having given plenty of acceptance speeches this year, Chastain took her first Oscar win as an opportunity to deliver arguably the evening’s most powerful remarks.  

Holding her award, Chastain talked about suicide prevention and queer rights, referring to recent anti-LGBTQ state bills.

“Right now, we are coming out of some difficult times that have been filled with a lot of trauma and isolation, and so many people out there feel hopelessness and they feel alone,” Chastain said. “And suicide is a leading cause of death in the United States. It’s touched many families; it’s touched mine, and especially members of the LGBTQ community, who oftentimes feel out of place with their peers.” 

“We’re faced with discriminatory and bigoted legislation that is sweeping our country with the only goal of further dividing us, “ she continued. “There’s violence and hate crimes being perpetuated on innocent civilians all over the world.”

She then touched on how she was inspired by Tammy Faye’s “radical acts of love,” referring to the evangelist’s allyship in the wake of her 1985 interview with a gay Christian pastor living with AIDS. (The interview features heavily in the film, which Chastain spent 10 years developing.)

“For any of you out there who do in fact feel hopeless or alone, I just want you to know that you are unconditionally loved for the uniqueness that is you,” she said.

A queer icon presents the evening’s highest honor 
Escorted by Lady Gaga, entertainment legend Liza Minnelli presented the award for best picture, which went to “CODA,” a drama centering on a largely deaf family and their hearing daughter. Minnelli’s appearance marked the 50th anniversary of the film that won her a best actress Oscar, the musical “Cabaret.” 

For Minnelli, the daughter of the legendary Judy Garland, Bob Fosse’s 1972 film about a Weimar Republic-era love triangle, involving Minelli and two men, represented a milestone that famously alluded Garland: an Oscar win.

“Cabaret” solidified Minnelli's status as a bonafide queer icon, akin to Garland’s own popularity among gay audiences. And later, after losing friends early on in the AIDS epidemic, Minnelli became a vocal activist for LGBTQ rights and visibility. 

The tender exchange between Minnelli and Gaga was a welcome salve as the sometimes painful evening came to a close. After a 76-year-old Minnelli, sitting in a wheelchair, received a standing ovation, Gaga leaned down to her and said, “You see that? The public, they love you.” 

“You know how I love working with legends,” Gaga continued, turning her attention to the crowd, while holding on to Minnelli’s hand. “And I’m honored to present the final award of the evening with a true show business legend.”",https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-pop-culture/7-queerest-moments-unforgettable-oscars-ceremony-rcna21808,"Despite the disappointing showing at the podium, queer culture still left its mark on the evening, from the red carpet to the awards stage.

Fox News,Amy Schumer reveals struggling with a disorder called trichotillomania: What is it?,I,"Comedian Amy Schumer is bringing awareness to a mental health condition she has secretly battled until now, according to multiple reports.  

""I think everybody has a big secret and that’s mine,"" she told The Hollywood Reporter over a mid-February interview.  

""And I’m proud that my big secret only hurts me, but it’s been what I’ve carried so much shame about for so long.""

Trichotillomania, pronounced (trick-o-till-o-may-nee-uh), is a condition marked by repetitive hair pulling that is classified as part of a group of body-focused repetitive behaviors, such as nail-biting, hair pulling or skin pricking, that leads to physical damage and psychological distress, according to the TLC Foundation for Body-Focused Repetitive Behaviors.

The condition occurs in approximately 1.7% of people in the United States over their lifetime, usually starting equally in boys and girls in late childhood, but by adulthood, 80-90% of reported cases are in women, per the foundation.  

And for Schumer, it started before she became a teenager when her life seemed in turmoil, according to her 2016 essay collection, ""The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo.""

""The person pulling their hair most often has no conscious awareness of the fact that they are doing it, but in some situations, they do,"" says Dr. Elie G. Aoun, assistant professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and a member of the American Psychiatric Association board of trustees.

""In such cases, it would be akin to self-injurious behaviors, meant to create a physical sensation that overpowers preexisting emotional discomfort, distracting one's mind from their stressors.""

The disorder started for Schumer when her father had just declared bankruptcy, her mother left him for her best friend’s dad as he was also coming to terms with being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, THR noted.

Aoun told Fox News that the condition negatively affects patient’s self-esteem, which in turn worsens their anxiety, so often patients get stuck in a ""vicious cycle that they have a hard time breaking out of.""  

It’s unclear what the exact cause of the condition is, but 2020 research suggests it’s a combination of biological and psychological factors, with an estimated 79% of people with trichotillomania having another mental health condition, such as anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, PTSD and ADHD, according to Psychiatry Research.  

Schumer fears she might pass the condition to her son, admitting: ""Every time he touches his head, I’m having a heart attack.""  

She channeled her troubled childhood into the half-hour Hulu dramedy titled ""Life & Beth,"" which premiered March 18, according to THR.  

She plays the main character, Beth, who in one scene needs a poorly-fitted wig before returning to school so she can hide the condition, which actually happened to her in real life, according to the news outlet.  

Trichotillomania patients hide their hair loss so often now that the standard diagnostic manual psychiatrists frequency use, DSM-5, also known as the fifth version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, loosened the requirement that patients must have visible hair loss to diagnose it, according to the National Survey of Drug Use and Health.  

Aoun told Fox News that it’s important to be aware that the condition not only results in significant hair loss, but can also lead to skin infections and scarring from repetitive hair pulling.  

He recommends aggressive moisturizing of the scalp to protect the skin and reduce the likelihood of fungal or other types of infections.

But the first step to manage the condition is being aware of it, which can be achieved with physical barriers, "" … either on the fingers or on the head that serve as a physical reminder of the behavior itself,"" Aoun added.

He recommended an alternative physical act, such as fidget spinners and spinning rings, that patients can utilize when they get triggered to pull their hair.

But if these strategies fail, Aoun said medications such as naltrexone, which is approved by the U.S. Food Drug and Administration to treat alcohol or opioid disorders, or lithium, which is a mood stabilizer, have been shown to be effective to treat the condition.

""And it’s not that I used to have this problem and now I don’t,"" Schumer told THR, ""it’s still something that I struggle with.""

""And I thought putting it in [the Hulu series] would be good for me to alleviate some of my shame and maybe, hopefully, help others alleviate some of theirs, too.""

BBC News,Will Smith: Can his career recover after Oscars slap?,I,"Will Smith went from beloved film favourite to Hollywood villain when he slapped Chris Rock on stage at the Oscars last weekend. Has he done permanent damage to his image and career, and what might happen next?

As the Oscars ended on Sunday night, Will Smith may have hoped he had nipped the fallout from his slap in the bud.

His tearful best actor acceptance speech, in which he apologised to the Academy and his fellow nominees and tried to frame himself as a ""defender of his family"", received a standing ovation.

He later made a show of posing and dancing with his best actor statuette at the after-show party in classic Big Willie style, as if nothing had happened. Or as if he was relieved to have ridden out the storm.

But when he woke the next morning, the storm hadn't passed. It only intensified as people took stock of his violent behaviour in the cold light of day.

""It is kind of crazy to think that this one incident could wipe away so many decades of goodwill,"" says The Wrap editor-in-chief Sharon Waxman.

""But it was so public, it was so outside of the box. One agent we talked to called it a 'stunning act of narcissism'. The movie star brand for Will Smith is badly tarnished.""

Her website has published an article asking film industry insiders if Smith's career is ""mortally wounded"".

""The conclusion is, yeah,"" Waxman says. ""'Mortally wounded' is a quote, that's what one of the agents we talked to called it, and said he's kind of done as an A-list movie star.

""The idea that people still relate to Will Smith and feel like he's somebody they want to look up to, and they want to admire, and pretend that - hey, that could be me up there on the screen - there's a real sense that that relatability has been taken away with this gesture.""

Kim Masters, editor-at-large of the Hollywood Reporter, agrees Smith - known for hits like Men In Black, Independence Day and Bad Boys - has done huge damage to his image.

""He's built a persona over many, many years, and this was a complete break from that persona,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

""People were absolutely shocked by his comportment and subsequently a rather peculiar acceptance speech and then dancing as if he had not a care in the world at the Vanity Fair party. So this is a big change of what people know and expect from Will Smith.""

The 53-year-old star had no history of causing trouble and was known to be generous with fellow cast members, she added. ""But nonetheless, many people have said they can't look at him the same again.""

What can we expect from him in the coming months?

There may be charity work, a public announcement of therapy or anger management, and the obligatory confessional interview - perhaps even on his family's Facebook chat show Red Table Talk.

That is where he and wife Jada Pinkett Smith came clean about their relationship issues in 2020, which is the closest he has come to scandal in the past.

It is also where Pinkett Smith opened up about her alopecia - the hair loss condition that was at the nub of her husband's Oscars outburst - and where Kevin Hart talked about quitting as host of the 2019 Oscars.

Forthcoming films
Smith also has a number of films in the pipeline that have now been thrown into uncertainty. They include Bad Boys 4, Bright 2 and Apple's Emancipation, in which he plays a runaway slave.

""A big indicator of how tarnished Will Smith's reputation is [will come] when we see what Apple decides to do with this movie,"" Waxman says.

""Everybody thought it would come out the second half of the year and be in contention for awards for next year, and we don't know what Apple's going to do.

""If they decide to push it [back], I think that'll give you some strong sense of, they don't want to be out in the marketplace with Will Smith this year.""

Other Hollywood stars who have fallen from grace may offer clues about what comes next, even if the circumstances of their behaviour differ.

Johnny Depp lost his role in the third Fantastic Beasts film after losing a libel case over a newspaper article that called him a wife beater. But he kept his Christian Dior adverts and a die-hard fanbase who have continued to support him at every turn.

He has also just been cast in his first film since the libel trial, a French production in which he will play Louis XV.

Mel Gibson has been hit by scandal more than once, admitting a drunken anti-Semitic outburst in 2006, and in 2010 when leaked tapes emerged of a tirade including racist insults against his then-girlfriend, who accused him of physical abuse.

He was eventually welcomed back by Hollywood - and was nominated for an Oscar in 2017.

Smith's career may be wounded but, if he can reconcile with Hollywood, it's not necessarily over. The final words of his acceptance speech on Sunday were: ""I hope the Academy invites me back.""

The chances of him being asked to present the best actress award at the 2023 Oscars - as the previous year's best actor winner would traditionally do - appear slim.

But it's also unlikely that he will be forced to hand back the golden statuette he won on Sunday.

Oscars organisers introduced a new code of conduct in 2017 in the wake of the #MeToo movement. Harvey Weinstein and Roman Polanski were expelled from the Academy as a result, but even they were not stripped of their Oscars.

Former ceremony host Whoopi Goldberg, who is one of three governors in the Academy's acting branch, said last week: ""We're not going to take that Oscar from him.

""There will be consequences, I'm sure, but I don't think that's what they're going to do, particularly because Chris [Rock] said, 'Listen, I'm not pressing any charges.'""

'Shocking and inexcusable'
Police did not arrest Smith after consulting Rock on the night, but have said they could file a report at a later date if the comedian changes his mind.

The Academy started disciplinary proceedings against Smith last week, with expulsion and suspension among the possible punishments. But Smith took matters into his own hands on Friday when he resigned his membership.

Despite that, Academy bosses said their disciplinary proceedings would continue and will discuss any further action on 18 April.

In his resignation letter, the actor hinted that he wants to move forward, saying he is ""committed to doing the work to ensure that I never again allow violence to overtake reason"".

But he also made clear that the gravity of his actions has now fully sunk in, acknowledging how ""shocking, painful and inexcusable"" they were.

CBR,Why Was Southern Cross' 'Robotech' Season Such a Flop?,I,"Many anime fans still fondly remember the series Macross from back in the 1980s, or perhaps they've seen the numerous sequels it's spawned. Western fans might be more familiar with the American adaptation Robotech, which is well known in its own way. Though most of the shows related to Macross became hits, one ""sequel"" went on to be anything but.

Southern Cross was the third entry in the ""Super Dimension"" trilogy that included Macross, though it's universally considered to be the worst one. This reception reflects a hellish production history, a surprising lack of merchandise and an even more ironic second chance through Robotech. Here's why anime fans have rarely experienced ""deja vu"" when thinking back on Southern Cross.

What Was The Southern Cross Anime?
Southern Cross is set in the futuristic year of 2120, where humanity has taken to the stars in order to colonize other worlds. Defending the human race is the Southern Cross army, who pilot powerful vehicles and mechanized armor. Their latest colony is the world of Glorie, which was once populated by the alien race known as the Zor. The two species quickly come into conflict with each other, and their war isn't unlike the battle between humanity and the Zentradi in Macross.

Southern Cross began as a concept by controversial artist Aki Uchiyama, who was known for his salacious, adult-oriented art. This series was going to feature female historical figures in a comedy of sorts, including Joan of Arc. Eventually, it was decided to drop the lolita aspect of the concept's characters, make them older and put them in a science fiction/fantasy setting. To make this change complete, staff from the classic mecha series Aura Battler Dunbine was brought over, but when that show's medieval setting failed to connect with audiences, it presented a problem.

Thus, the show finally became a pure sci-fi mecha series that was able to secure the ""Super Dimension"" moniker from sponsor Big West. This didn't mean it was a sequel to The Super Dimension Fortress Macross, however -- it simply shared a similar prefix like the second Super Dimension series, Orguss. In fact, Macross is even referenced as a show within the universe of Southern Cross.

Why Wasn't Southern Cross Successful Like Macross?
Unfortunately, much of the other staff weren't used to animated complex mecha designs, resulting in Southern Cross having some outright horrid-looking giant robots. Given that it was, in fact, a mecha series, these unflattering designs were a deterrent. It didn't help that, ironically enough, Southern Cross didn't have much in the way of official merchandise. Though there were some products, none of these amounted to a line of mech toys or model kits such as those for Macross or the Mobile Suit Gundam franchise.

The biggest batch of salt in the wound was the fact that Matchbox produced toys based on the series' mechas when footage from Southern Cross was used in the ""Masters Saga"" of Robotech. This saw Japan importing the American toys for Southern Cross as they had none of their own, all the while reversing the situation for the first part of Robotech, where legal entanglements prevented American toy companies from importing Japanese Macross toys.

Another big issue was that Southern Cross was a rush job that had to be produced quickly to be a time slot follow-up to Orguss. Further deterring its success was the pending release of the Macross movie, Do You Remember Love?. There was much more advertisement for this than Southern Cross, keeping the first Super Dimension series in the public eye while downplaying the newest one. This was probably deserved, since the series wasn't exactly great. Its intended 32 episodes were cut down to 23, so its story had to be truncated to a horribly paced degree. Plots and concepts are introduced but quickly dropped, and the characters aren't much better.

The show also failed to get the crossover success of Macross due to a combination of lethargic action by way of even poorer robot designs, as well as none of the great romance Macross was known for. The love stories in Southern Cross, if they can even be called that, are shallow and poorly developed, and it doesn't help that the main character is a bit of an annoying airhead. With all these issues combined, Super Dimension Calvary Southern Cross came and went in 1984. The best thing to come out of the series was its admittedly decent music, namely the hip intro song ""Hoshi no Deja Vu"" by Yoko Katori. It can be streamed through Tubi TV, though it's only really worth it for the most die-hard of Macross or mecha anime fans.
