0,The Guardian,‘He helped shape the modern world’ Gif inventor Stephen Wilhite dies after getting Covid,C,"He created the image file format that defined an internet culture for decades in 1987 while working at CompuServe
If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a gif is worth millions. The image file format has been a defining element of internet culture for decades, with glass-raising DiCaprios and mic-dropping Obamas facilitating self-expression in a faceless digital world. And we have one man to thank for all the jokes, snark and praise: Stephen Wilhite, inventor of the gif, who died last week, aged 74.

Wilhite, who lived in Milford, Ohio, contracted Covid two weeks before his death, his wife, Kathaleen Wilhite, told NPR.

A lifelong coder, Stephen Wilhite created the gif in 1987 while working at CompuServe. The compressed image files were useful at a time when internet connections dragged. “If you want lossless, compressed graphics, there is nothing better than gif,” said Sandy Trevor, who managed Wilhite’s team, to the Daily Dot in 2012.
Wilhite “invented gif all by himself – he actually did that at home and brought it into work after he perfected it”, said Kathaleen Wilhite to the Verge. “He would figure out everything privately in his head and then go to town programming it on the computer.” It was his proudest achievement, she said.

The same year, an update led to animated graphics. “I think the first gif was a picture of a plane. It was a long time ago,” Stephen Wilhite told the Daily Dot in 2012. Indeed, according to Giphy, the go-to site for gif seekers, it was this image:

Wilhite worked for Compuserve until 2001, after he had a stroke. Meanwhile, gifs’ popularity took off, including on early social media sites such as MySpace. By 1996, the “dancing baby” image – one of Wilhite’s favorites, he told the New York Times – was plastered across the the web and attached to emails. In 2012, “gif” was dubbed word of the year by Oxford American Dictionaries. The next year, the New York Times called the format “the aesthetic calling card of modern Internet culture”.

That year, Wilhite received a Webby lifetime achievement award. Called to the stage, he maintained a poker face as he delivered an acceptance “speech” in an appropriate format:

Wilhite continued to code for the rest of his life. He was also passionate about model trains, Kathaleen Wilhite told NPR, and the couple were avid campers; he “loved travelling”, his obituary says. Beyond his work and his hobbies, “he was probably one of the kindest, humble men you’ve ever met,” Kathaleen Wilhite told the radio network. “People loved him and respected his work, and that would mean more to him than anything is how they respected what he did … I miss him more than anyone could imagine.”


Tributes poured in on his obituary page. “You changed the way we converse as a society, and immortalized countless moments that would otherwise be fleeting,” wrote one well-wisher. “Thank you for helping the modern world take shape,” wrote another.

Giphy offered a tribute of its own, hailing “the simplicity of the format, the power of the looping image. We are indebted to the creativity and vision of Mr Wilhite.”

For those who’d like to honor Wilhite’s memory themselves, there are plenty of gifs that pay tribute to their inventor. Perhaps even better, you can heed his unequivocal advice: pronounce it “jif”.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/24/stephen-wilhite-gif-inventor-dies,3/24/2022
1,The Guardian,Microplastics found in human blood for first time,C,"Exclusive: The discovery shows the particles can travel around the body and may lodge in organs

Microplastic pollution has been detected in human blood for the first time, with scientists finding the tiny particles in almost 80% of the people tested.

The discovery shows the particles can travel around the body and may lodge in organs. The impact on health is as yet unknown. But researchers are concerned as microplastics cause damage to human cells in the laboratory and air pollution particles are already known to enter the body and cause millions of early deaths a year.

Huge amounts of plastic waste are dumped in the environment and microplastics now contaminate the entire planet, from the summit of Mount Everest to the deepest oceans. People were already known to consume the tiny particles via food and water as well as breathing them in, and they have been found in the faeces of babies and adults.

The scientists analysed blood samples from 22 anonymous donors, all healthy adults and found plastic particles in 17. Half the samples contained PET plastic, which is commonly used in drinks bottles, while a third contained polystyrene, used for packaging food and other products. A quarter of the blood samples contained polyethylene, from which plastic carrier bags are made.

“Our study is the first indication that we have polymer particles in our blood – ​it’s a breakthrough result,” said Prof Dick Vethaak, an ecotoxicologist at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in the Netherlands. “But we have to extend the research and increase the sample sizes, the number of polymers assessed, etc.” Further studies by a number of groups are already under way, he said.

“It is certainly reasonable to be concerned,” Vethaak told the Guardian. “The particles are there and are transported throughout the body.” He said previous work had shown that microplastics were 10 times higher in the faeces of babies compared with adults and that babies fed with plastic bottles are swallowing millions of microplastic particles a day.

“We also know in general that babies and young children are more vulnerable to chemical and particle exposure,” he said. “That worries me a lot.”

The new research is published in the journal Environment International and adapted existing techniques to detect and analyse particles as small as 0.0007mm. Some of the blood samples contained two or three types of plastic. The team used steel syringe needles and glass tubes to avoid contamination, and tested for background levels of microplastics using blank samples.

Vethaak acknowledged that the amount and type of plastic varied considerably between the blood samples. “But this is a pioneering study,” he said, with more work now needed. He said the differences might reflect short-term exposure before the blood samples were taken, such as drinking from a plastic-lined coffee cup, or wearing a plastic face mask.

“The big question is what is happening in our body?” Vethaak said. “Are the particles retained in the body? Are they transported to certain organs, such as getting past the blood-brain barrier?” And are these levels sufficiently high to trigger disease? We urgently need to fund further research so we can find out.”

The new research was funded by the Dutch National Organisation for Health Research and Development and Common Seas, a social enterprise working to reduce plastic pollution.

“Plastic production is set to double by 2040,” said Jo Royle, founder of the charity Common Seas. “We have a right to know what all this plastic is doing to our bodies.” Common Seas, along with more than 80 NGOs, scientists and MPs, are asking the UK government to allocate £15m to research on the human health impacts of plastic. The EU is already funding research on the impact of microplastic on foetuses and babies, and on the immune system.

A recent study found that microplastics can latch on to the outer membranes of red blood cells and may limit their ability to transport oxygen. The particles have also been found in the placentas of pregnant women, and in pregnant rats they pass rapidly through the lungs into the hearts, brains and other organs of the foetuses.

A new review paper published on Tuesday, co-authored by Vethaak, assessed cancer risk and concluded: “More detailed research on how micro- and nano-plastics affect the structures and processes of the human body, and whether and how they can transform cells and induce carcinogenesis, is urgently needed, particularly in light of the exponential increase in plastic production. The problem is becoming more urgent with each day.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/24/microplastics-found-in-human-blood-for-first-time,3/24/2022

The U.S. has announced new sanctions against Russia and said it would welcome 100,000 refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine as President Joe Biden met with world leaders for a series of emergency summits.

The war has caused a humanitarian and refugee crisis, with more than 10 million people displaced, including 4.3 million children — more than half of the country's child population, according to the U.N.

Biden said Thursday that Russia should be removed from the G-20, the group that represents 20 of the world's largest economies, as Western allies gathered in Europe to discuss new support for Kyiv.

That includes imposing further punishment on Moscow one month after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched Europe's biggest conflict since World War II.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged an increase in military aid for his country in an address at the NATO summit in Brussels via video link. His ability to rally countries to Kyiv’s cause in video messages from the capital has served as a symbol of Ukraine’s defiant defense and Russia’s struggling advance.

Biden and U.S. allies were also set to discuss moves to bolster NATO’s eastern flank and how to counter the prospect of escalation from the Kremlin amid fears of a chemical or even nuclear attack.

4,NBC News,"Almost 2 in 5 Covid-19 researchers have faced harassment, survey finds",C,"Harassment of researchers and public health officials during the pandemic has become a growing concern and a focus for professional organizations.

Nearly 2 in 5 Covid-19 researchers reported they had been harassed since the pandemic began, according to a new survey published Thursday in Science.

The survey included responses from 510 researchers who have published about Covid-19 and was conducted by the news team of the journal Science. 

The survey, which has not gone through a peer review process, found that 38 percent of those researchers had experienced harassment of some kind. Before the pandemic, 71 percent of respondents said they received less harassment or no abuse at all. 

Researchers reported personal insults and attacks on their professional capabilities as the most common types of harassment. Other types of abuse — such as threats of harm, physical intimidation and doxxing — were reported more rarely. Eighteen scientists — about 3.5 percent of those surveyed — said they received death threats. 

Scientists with public stances on politicized topics — including those against the use of the drug ivermectin — were more likely to experience harassment, the Science analysis suggested. 

Science asked nearly 9,600 researchers for their perspective, and it’s possible the results are skewed by those who chose to respond. 

Harassment of researchers and public health officials during the pandemic has become a growing concern and a focus for professional organizations.

A survey by Nature, which included responses from 321 researchers who discussed Covid-19 in the media, found that 81 percent reported receiving personal attacks, 22 percent had received threats of physical or sexual violence and 15 percent received death threats.

A Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health study published last week found widespread reports of harassment among local public health departments. 

In survey data collected by the National Association of County and City Health Officials, researchers found 57 percent of health departments reported harassment during the first 11 months of the pandemic, with 1,499 unique cases reported.",https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/almost-2-5-covid-19-researchers-faced-harassment-rcna21060,3/24/2022
5,NBC News,Pfizer recalls some high blood pressure drugs over possible cancer risk,C,"The company recalled six lots of its Accuretic tablets, as well as authorized generics distributed by Greenstone.

Pfizer, the pharmaceutical company behind one of the Covid-19 vaccines, recalled certain lots of its high blood pressure medication for containing high levels of nitrosamines, which can lead to increased cancer risk.

The company announced a nationwide recall Monday and said it was pulling six lots of its Accuretic tablets.

It also pulled authorized generics distributed by its Greenstone subsidiary directly to patients — one lot of quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and four lots of quinapril HCl/ hydrochlorothiazide tablets.

Pfizer said nitrosamines are in food and water, including cured and grilled meats, dairy products and vegetables. But its medication was found to contain levels of nitrosamines that are higher than the acceptable daily intake level.

""Pfizer places the utmost emphasis on patient safety and product quality at every step in the manufacturing and supply chain process,"" the company said in a news release. ""Pfizer has notified direct consignees by letter to arrange for return of any recalled product.""

The lots were distributed nationwide from November 2019 to this month. Pfizer said that it was not aware of any reports of adverse events related to the recall and that the Food and Drug Administration was aware of the situation.

""The products have a safety profile that has been established over 20 years of marketing authorization and through a robust clinical program,"" the company said.

""Pfizer believes the benefit/risk profile of the products remains positive based on currently available data. Although long-term ingestion of N-nitroso-quinapril may be associated with a potential increased cancer risk in humans, there is no immediate risk to patients taking this medication.""

People who have been taking the medication should talk with their doctors about other options.

The presence of nitrosamines in blood pressure drugs has resulted in at least one other recall. In 2019, the FDA expanded a recall to include 32 lots of losartan, a drug sold by Macleods Pharmaceuticals, after they were found to contain unacceptable levels of the compounds.",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/pfizer-recalls-high-blood-pressure-drugs-possible-cancer-risk-rcna21346,3/24/2022
6,NBC News,Michigan school board president removed after she's accused of beating treasurer,C,"“She grabbed the top of my head and then slammed my head into the table and started punching my head,"" saidLaura MacIntyre, a member and the treasurer of the Flint board.

A Michigan school board president is accused of choking and punching a board member during a meeting before she was removed as the board’s leader, officials said Thursday.

The incident occurred at an otherwise ""mundane"" gathering Wednesday morning in Flint, said Laura MacIntyre, a member and the treasurer of the board, who was leading a meeting about finance issues.

MacIntyre said she was managing the order of comments from board members when Flint Board of Education President Danielle Green exploded.

""Very, very mundane. So mundane I don't even remember what it was that set her off,"" MacIntyre said Thursday.

Green walked to MacIntyre's seat ""and got up right above me, towered over me and started wagging her finger at me,"" MacIntyre said.

""And I stood up, in surprise, to step back from her — at which point she grabbed my throat and started choking me,"" MacIntyre said. ""She grabbed the top of my head and then slammed my head into the table and started punching my head.""

Green did not reply to multiple requests for comment Thursday.

There was no obvious spark for the attack, said school board counsel Charis Lee, a spokeswoman for the district.

""I was just told it was not provoked by individuals who saw it,"" Lee said Thursday.

Later in the day, trustees removed Green as president but not from the board itself.

There's no mechanism to recall a Flint school board member, and only the governor would have such power, Lee and MacIntyre said

A representative for Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

MacIntyre said she was treated by her physician Wednesday and was in concussion protocol Thursday.

“I’m physically in a lot of pain and struggling,” she said.

There have been no arrests, and the incident is being investigated, Flint Police Detective-Sgt. Tyrone Booth said.

""I can't say that an assault” at a school board meeting “was one that I can recall,"" Booth said. ""Obviously, there are emotional issues that a school board discusses, and sometimes temperatures and personal temperatures go up a little. But I can't say that I can recall an assault that's taken place.""

MacIntyre said she'll seek a restraining order against Green. The next school board meeting is set for April 13.

The two board members have known each other for years and have had no friction, MacIntyre said.

7,NBC News,Native American activist imprisoned for nearly half a century makes push for clemency,C,"Peltier, 77, has been held since 1977 for the deaths of two FBI agents. He maintains his innocence, and supporters say he deserves to be released on compassionate grounds.

Leonard Peltier, the Native American activist who has been imprisoned for nearly half a century for the murders of two FBI agents he has always maintained he didn't commit, is hopeful he'll have a chance to clear his name before he dies.

Peltier, 77, wants President Joe Biden to review his case and grant him clemency so he won't die in prison.

He's not looking for a presidential pardon, because it would be granted for a crime he insists he is innocent of.

Instead, he wants a new trial.

“If I get into court, if the judge is fair, how are they going to answer all of that?” he said of evidence that was withheld from the 1977 proceedings. “I want to get a trial.""

Recent calls from Peltier's supporters and family for him to be released have noted his failing health, including a recent bout of Covid-19.

""They're going to try and make me die here,"" Peltier said by phone Wednesday from his federal prison in Central Florida, his first media interview since 2016. ""I have a last few years, and I got to fight.""

Peltier's family says he is struggling with diabetes, hypertension, partial blindness from a stroke and an abdominal aortic aneurysm and that he tested positive for Covid in late January at the Federal Correctional Complex Coleman’s high-security facility.

Peltier said he was vaccinated against the coronavirus before he tested positive and that his chest, neck and head had hurt for a few days. He got a booster shot after he left 10 days of quarantine, he said.

The roughest part, he said, was being isolated and not receiving adequate care. He felt ""cold,"" and ""the food was bad,"" he said, adding, ""That was worse than getting Covid.""

Having spent years in prison mulling over his case and the various legal rulings, Peltier said there is evidence he'd like to present to show he didn't fire the bullets that killed the agents in a chaotic shootout on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota in June 1975.

""My lawyer said if I were tried today, they would never get away with it,"" he said.

His attorney, Kevin Sharp, a former federal judge, said Peltier has exhausted his appeals and that there remains no actual process for him to get a new trial unless federal prosecutors decide to reopen the case.

""They wouldn't do that, because there's no evidence to convict him on,"" Sharp said. ""He was convicted on aiding and abetting murder, but who did he aid and abet? His co-defendants were acquitted based on self-defense.""

Over the decades, criminal justice reform advocates have continued to highlight his arrest and conviction, saying it symbolizes systemic problems with how Native Americans are treated in the justice system, as well as imprisoned at higher rates by the federal government compared to other racial groups.

Human rights organizations and prominent political and religious figures, including Pope Francis and the Dalai Lama and other Nobel Peace Prize recipients, such as Nelson Mandela and Bishop Desmond Tutu, are reported to have called for Peltier's release.

Peltier's case has drawn scrutiny from those living on the Pine Ridge reservation, as well as members of his tribe, the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa. Other Native American activists and groups also believe Peltier is innocent and was made a scapegoat by the federal government in its pursuit to hold someone accountable for the agents' deaths.

But he has consistently been denied parole — in 2009, federal prosecutors said he was ""an unrepentant, cold-blooded murderer"" — and he isn't eligible again until 2024. In October, 11 members of Congress petitioned the Biden administration to grant clemency based on compassionate grounds.

Rep. Raúl Grijalva, D-Ariz., a clemency supporter, said he spoke with Peltier by phone after he learned Peltier had Covid. Grijalva's office said last month that Peltier described ""difficulties receiving adequate medical attention and gaining access to basic needs, like water.""

The Justice Department's Bureau of Prisons declined to comment on Peltier's case, citing privacy and security reasons. It said that it makes ""every effort"" to ensure the safety of inmates and that at Coleman, every inmate is given access to drinking water, adequate medical care and food.

Sharp said he believes Peltier's age, health and recent illness make him a prime candidate for release and that his clean and nonviolent prison record also indicates he isn't a threat to the public.

The number of inmates with Covid at federal prisons reached its peak around the time Peltier contracted the coronavirus, with close to 10,000 of them testing positive, according to Justice Department data. Active cases have dropped to about 100 this week, but Sharp believes Peltier is still at risk.

""Leonard Peltier is incapable of protecting himself. And if you're not going to do it, BOP, let him go home,"" Sharp said, referring to the Bureau of Prisons. ""This is where justice and mercy meet. Grant him clemency and send him home.""

It's unclear how familiar Biden is with Peltier's case, which has spawned hundreds of pages of FBI files; several books, including his own memoir, published in 1999; and the 1992 documentary ""Incident at Oglala,"" which was narrated by Robert Redford.

The FBI said in a statement Thursday that it remains ""resolute against the commutation of Leonard Peltier's sentence"" and that ""we must never forget or put aside that Peltier intentionally and mercilessly murdered these two young men and has never expressed remorse for his ruthless actions.""

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

Asked in January whether Biden was reviewing a request to commute Peltier's sentence, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters, ""I don't have anything to predict for you.""

In recent weeks, Democrats have tried to appeal to Biden. The Democratic National Committee's Native American Caucus wrote in a letter last week that Peltier's continued incarceration ""symbolizes the decades-old racial injustice towards Native Americans,"" HuffPost reported.

The encounter that led Peltier to prison involved a pair of FBI agents, Jack Coler and Ron Williams, who went onto a compound on the Pine Ridge reservation to arrest a man on a federal warrant in connection with the theft of a pair of cowboy boots, according to the agency's investigative files.

Peltier was a member of the American Indian Movement, a grassroots activist organization that began in Minneapolis in the 1960s to challenge police brutality and the oppression of Native Americans' rights. He was at Pine Ridge in 1975 in the wake of a drawn-out protest two years earlier at Wounded Knee, South Dakota, where armed American Indian Movement activists and Oglala Sioux tribal members had occupied the town and clashed with federal law enforcement officers. Two activists were killed.

On the day Coler and Williams were at Pine Ridge, they radioed that they had come under fire. It's unclear who pulled the trigger first; the FBI said the men were in a shootout that lasted 10 minutes. Both men were killed by bullets fired at close range. According to the FBI, Peltier was identified as the only person in possession of a weapon that could fire the type of bullet that killed them.

Dozens of people participated in the gunfight; at trial, two co-defendants were acquitted after they claimed self-defense. When Peltier was tried separately in 1977, no witnesses were presented who could identify him as the shooter, and unbeknown to his defense lawyers at the time, the federal government had withheld a ballistics report indicating the fatal bullets didn't come from his weapon, Sharp said.

""My co-defendants were found not guilty in self-defense, and I'm the one doing all this time,"" Peltier said.

The FBI maintains his conviction was ""rightly and fairly obtained"" and ""has withstood numerous appeals to multiple courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court.""

The incident is seen as an emblematic struggle between Native Americans and the federal government, particularly on Indigenous lands, and it has long rankled Indigenous activists who say the killing of a Native American man in the shootout was never formally investigated.

Over the years, former FBI agents have pushed back against Peltier's claim of innocence and bid for clemency. When Peltier's family sought help from President Bill Clinton, then-FBI Director Louis Freeh wrote in a letter that ""ignoring for a moment, the extreme and remorseless brutality of the acts themselves, our employees see Peltier's crimes as a complete affront to our cherished system of government under the rule of law.""

In a rare public demonstration by members of the FBI, about 500 active and retired agents and staff members marched to the White House to protest any action by Clinton.

But last year, retired federal prosecutor James Reynolds, who supervised Peltier's post-trial sentencing and appeals, broke from the federal government's position.

He wrote in a letter to Biden that ""we were not able to prove that Mr. Peltier personally committed any offense on the Pine Ridge Reservation."" He also underscored a long-held belief that Peltier was treated differently at the time because of a ""broken relationship between Native Americans and the government"" and that he was prosecuted with ""minimal evidence"" that ""I strongly doubt would be upheld in any court today.""

Peltier said Wednesday he was grateful for Reynolds' letter.

""If I could say to him: 'Thank you for finally coming forward. ... I thank you for your courage, and I hope that you can prevent this from ever happening to anyone else.'""

Two of Peltier's adult children said in interviews that they would like a meeting with the White House now so Biden can understand his case and why they believe his release is warranted.

""I know that Joe and Jill Biden are compassionate to the Native peoples,"" said his daughter Kathy Peltier, who lives in Los Angeles. ""I think seeing the family would make them see him as a real person, and we can explain what he's facing so it hits a little harder for them.""

Kathy Peltier said she had been hopeful that past administrations would listen. But the presidencies of Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump came and went.

In December 2016, Leonard Peltier's youngest son, Wahacanka Paul Shields-Peltier, died on a trip to Washington, D.C., advocating for his father's release. He was 41.

He died in the waning days of Obama's second term, when the family remained optimistic that the president would grant Peltier clemency.

With the loss of her brother and the realization that her father would never get to see him again, Kathy Peltier was in shock.

Kathy Peltier said that on the day Obama left office after having commuted hundreds of sentences — by far the most of any recent president — she turned off her phone and refused to leave her bedroom.

""I shut out the world,"" she said.

Kathy Peltier, 46, has known her father only as a federal prisoner. She said it has been difficult to come to terms with how he has missed out on his family's lives. He has six surviving children and a dozen great-grandchildren.

Peltier's oldest son, Chauncey Peltier, 56, who lives in Oregon, previously saw his father in 2015, when he visited him in prison. To channel his emotions, Leonard Peltier took up oil painting featuring Native American themes and iconography.

""The family prays every day and hopes he gets to go home, but some of us aren't hopeful it will ever happen,"" he said. ""In his children's eyes, Leonard wasn't the only one robbed.""

Leonard Peltier hasn't painted in a couple of years amid Covid restrictions in prison. But, he said, the art studio will be opening up again, and he hopes to pick up a brush in the next week.

To all of his supporters, including those who have helped with his legal defense, he said, he is thankful they haven't forgotten him and hopes their messages to the White House are heard.

""One of the elders, when I was convicted and I was going to leave the courtroom, she stood by the railing and said: 'They don't know who they did this to. We will be here the rest of our lives,'"" Peltier said. ""And they have been.

""I would love to go home,"" he added. ""My family wants to take care of me. My tribe wants to take care of me.""

9,NBC News,Arizona Legislature passes 15-week abortion ban,C,"The bill now goes to Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, who has signed every piece of anti-abortion legislation that has reached his desk since he took office in 2015.
PHOENIX — The Arizona Legislature on Thursday joined the growing list of Republican-led states to pass aggressive anti-abortion legislation as the conservative U.S. Supreme Court is considering ratcheting back abortion rights that have been in place for nearly 50 years.

The House voted on party lines to outlaw abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, mirroring a Mississippi law now being considered by the nation’s high court.

The bill explicitly says it does not overrule a state law in place for more than 100 years that would ban abortion outright if the Supreme Court overrules Roe v. Wade, the 1973 case that enshrined the right to abortion in law.

The bill now goes to Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, an abortion opponent who has signed every piece of anti-abortion legislation that has reached his desk since he took office in 2015.

Florida lawmakers have passed a similar 15-week abortion ban early this month that Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis is expected to sign. A bill in West Virginia failed to pass the state Senate by the time its legislative session ended earlier this month after passing the House.

An Arizona proposal that would outlaw abortion after about six weeks has not advanced. A bill enacted in Texas last year allows private citizens to enforce the ban, and the Supreme Court refused to block it. Idaho’s governor signed a copycat bill this week. Those measures are unique in that they allow private citizens to file civil lawsuits against anyone who helps someone else get an abortion after six weeks. It has made legal challenges difficult because the government is not involved in enforcement.

The Arizona 15-week abortion ban bill contains no exceptions for rape or incest or for a medical emergency.

“I am becoming more frightened by the moment by this bill,” Democratic Rep. Mitzi Epstein said during Thursday’s floor debate. “I’m terrified that this bill would outlaw health care for a woman having a naturally occurring and tragic and horrible miscarriage and they would not be allowed to get this health care.”

Republican backers said little during the floor debate.

Minority Democrats have said the measure is unconstitutional and that any ban would disproportionately impact poor and minority women who won’t be able to travel to states without strict abortion laws.

But Sen. Nancy Barto, the Republican sponsor of the bill, has said she hopes the high court upholds Mississippi’s law banning abortion after 15 weeks.

“The state has an obligation to protect life, and that is what this bill is about,” Barto said during Senate debate last month.

The debate and vote on the 15-week abortion ban came the same morning that the House also debated a ban on transgender girls from playing on the high school or college sports team that aligns with their gender identity. The House voted Thursday to pass a bill banning gender reassignment surgery for anyone younger than 18.

Arizona already has some of the nation’s most restrictive abortion laws, including one that would automatically outlaw it if the high court fully overturns Roe.

Republicans hope to put the 15-week ban in place so it takes effect quickly if the Supreme Court further limits abortion rights but stops short of fully overturning Roe. The measure closely mirrors the Mississippi law.

Under current abortion rulings, abortion is legal until the point a fetus can survive outside the womb, which is usually around 24 weeks.

Barto’s bill would make it a crime for a doctor to perform an abortion after 15 weeks but would prohibit the prosecution of pregnant people for receiving one. Doctors could face felony charges and lose their license to practice medicine. There is an exception for cases when the mother is at risk of death or serious permanent injury, but not for instances of rape or incest.

Of the 13,186 abortions performed in Arizona in 2020, 636 were after 15 weeks of pregnancy, according to the latest data from the Arizona Department of Health Services.",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/arizona-legislature-passes-15-week-abortion-ban-rcna21478,3/24/2022
10,NBC News,Supreme Court says spiritual advisers can touch prisoners at the time of execution,C,"A Texas inmate said the state is violating his religious rights by refusing to let his pastor pray audibly with him or perform a laying-on of hands inside the execution chamber.  

Federal law gives prisoners facing execution the right to have a spiritual adviser in the death chamber who can pray aloud and touch them, the Supreme Court ruled Thursday.  

The ruling came in the case of a Texas inmate, John Henry Ramirez, whose lethal injection was scheduled for September last year but was blocked by the court to consider his appeal. He said the state violated his religious rights by refusing to let his pastor pray audibly with him or perform a tradition known as the laying-on of hands.  

The state’s refusal, the court said, meant Ramirez “will be unable to engage in protected religious exercise in the final moments of his life.”

The 8-1 decision was written by Chief Justice John Roberts and joined by all but Clarence Thomas, who said Ramirez was merely trying to “'manipulate the judicial process' to win further delay” in carrying out the death sentence.

Texas allows spiritual advisers to pray with and counsel an inmate until the prisoner is taken into the lethal injection chamber. Preventing them from speaking or touching an inmate from that point on preserved the execution team’s ability to detect signs of distress, the state said.

But the court said the state’s categorial ban was too restrictive. 

“We do not see how letting the spiritual advisor stand slightly closer, reach out his arm, and touch part of the prisoner’s body well away from the side of any IV line would meaningfully increase risk,” Roberts wrote.

Roberts cited a history of clerical prayer at the time of an execution, from the early 1700s in England to the execution of conspirators in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, and to the execution of Nazi war criminals after World War II.

In recent years, the Supreme Court has been receptive to claims that states improperly denied the religious freedom of inmates facing the death penalty. It blocked a scheduled execution in 2019 of another Texas inmate who said his religious freedom was violated because his Buddhist spiritual adviser wasn’t allowed to be with him.

In response, Texas banned all spiritual advisers from the execution chamber. Then in 2020, the Supreme Court stayed the execution of a Texas inmate challenging the no-advisers policy, so the state changed its policy again but retained the prohibition on praying aloud or touching. 

Ramirez said that both he and his pastor believed that people either ascend to heaven or descend to damnation at the moment of death. He contended that denying him the traditional ministrations by his pastor violated his religious freedom.

Texas said its protocol balanced many factors, including maintaining uniformity in executions to reduce the opportunity for errors, protecting the safety and privacy of execution personnel and the rights of the inmate, and providing closure for the victim’s family and the community.

Nine states — Arizona, Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, Montana, South Dakota and Utah — urged the court to side with Texas. “The safety and security of state execution protocols should not be subject to federal court micromanagement,” they said in a friend-of-court brief. 

But several religious organizations, including the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, said the Texas prohibition burdens the religious freedom not only of inmates, but also of their pastors in carrying out key actions of the ministry. 

Ramirez was sentenced to death for fatally stabbing a man 29 times during a convenience store robbery following a drug binge. He fled to Mexico but was later arrested and brought back for trial.

In the Supreme Court, he did not seek to challenge either his conviction or his death sentence.",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-says-spiritual-advisers-can-touch-prisoners-time-executi-rcna21374,3/24/2022
11,The Guardian,World Cup roundup/ Italy knocked out by North Macedonia in dramatic finale,C,"Aleksandar Trajkovski’s goal knocks out European champions
North Macedonia now face Portugal, who beat Turkey 3-1

Italy missed out on the World Cup finals again after losing 1-0 at home to North Macedonia in their playoff semi-final as Aleksandar Trajkovski’s last-gasp strike earned the visitors a famous win.

Italy did not qualify for the World Cup four years ago, missing out for the first time since 1958, but the European champions dominated from the off in Palermo. The hosts became more desperate in their search for a winner after the break, however, as chances continued to come and go before, in stoppage time, Trajkovski arrowed in a stunning winner to spark wild North Macedonian celebrations.

Italy's João Pedro agonising after missing one of 32 shots on the North Macedonia goal in Palermo

Roberto Mancini’s Italy side had 32 efforts at goal in the match but somehow fell short, with North Macedonia going on to play Portugal in the playoff final on Tuesday for a place in Qatar.

“It is a huge disappointment,” the Italy midfielder Jorginho said. “It hurts, it hurts so much. We have always created and dominated matches but we have not been able to finish teams off. It is not to blame anyone in particular but it is the reality.

“I don’t know why we haven’t been able to do this, I am also involved in this, and it hurts me to think about it.”

Without the veteran pairing Leonardo Bonucci and Giorgio Chiellini through injury, Italy’s makeshift defence was barely troubled in the first half, as all the action took place down the other end.

Domenico Berardi had the best of the openings, having been presented with the ball after the North Macedonia goalkeeper Stole Dimitrievski misplaced a pass, but his shot was tame, with Dimitrievski getting back to make the save. Ciro Immobile also wasted a glorious first-half chance for Italy when blazing over the bar from a good position.

Berardi was again guilty of profligacy after the break, shooting over when he should have hit the target, and with their only meaningful attack of the match North Macedonia seized their chance. Italy did not look to be in too much danger, but Trajkovski, who plays in Saudi Arabia for Al-Fayha, wrote his name into North Macedonian football folklore with a shot that crept inside the post to stun the home fans.

Portugal moved into the final with a 3-1 win over Turkey, for whom Burak Yilmaz skied a penalty five minutes from full time that would have drawn the sides level.

Roared on by a sold-out Estádio do Dragão in Porto, Portugal dominated the game from the start and went 2-0 up in the first half after Otavio scored one goal and created another for Diogo Jota before half-time. But Fernando Santos’s side were pegged back by a Yilmaz goal in the 65th minute that put the Portuguese fans on the edge of their seats as Turkey started to threaten.

José Fonte then fouled Enes Unal inside the area in the 85th minute to concede a penalty given by VAR but Yilmaz fired it high over the bar. The Portugal substitute Matheus Nunes relieved the pressure on the hosts in added time with their third goal from a counterattack.

The Sweden substitute Robin Quaison struck in the second half of extra time to secure a 1-0 win over the Czech Republic and set up a clash away to Poland.

The Czechs had an early goal ruled out for a foul and the Swedes had the lion’s share of possession for most of the playoff semi-final, but the two sides struggled to break each other down in a game full of tough tackling and wayward passing.

The substitute Mattias Svanberg went closest for the Swedes in normal time, but his header from Emil Forsberg’s corner was aimed straight at the visiting goalkeeper Tomas Vaclik.

The game finished scoreless after 90 minutes and appeared to be heading for penalties when Quaison danced through the middle of the defence before exchanging passes with Alexander Isak and coolly slotting home to move his side a step closer to Qatar.",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/24/world-cup-roundup-italy-north-macedonia-portugal-turkey,3/24/2022
12,The Daily Wire,"‘We’ve Sold 25,000 Razor Subscriptions In Our First Three Days’: Daily Wire CEO Joins Tim Pool To Discuss Jeremy’s Razors, Woke Corporations",C,"On Thursday night, co-CEO of The Daily Wire Jeremy Boreing sat down live in-studio for an interview with Tim Pool, popular podcaster and host of TimCast IRL, to discuss The Daily Wire’s latest venture — Jeremy’s Razors, a new company launched by The Daily Wire in response to Harry’s razors pulling its advertising from The Daily Wire in 2021. Boreing also talked about the success of Jeremy’s Razors, announcing that the company had sold 25,000 razor subscriptions in just three days.

Jeremy’s Razors also released a multi-million dollar marketing campaign, and its first ad, which features the McLaren-driving “god-king” Boreing walking through The Daily Wire’s headquarters and torching a pack of Harry’s razors. It has received more than one million views on Twitter.

The ad also caught the eye of Pool, who praised the ad as “one of the funniest commercials ever.” He added that the whole idea was “brilliant” and that “The Daily Wire knows the power of culture” during a segment of his podcast.

On Thursday, Pool had Boreing on Timcast IRL to discuss Jeremy’s Razors and why a company like this was necessary.

“The most amazing thing about [this is] … this is my first time on the show, and my first time to share this information publicly — we’ve sold 25,000 razor subscriptions in our first three days as a company, which is an amazing thing, obviously, and it makes the joke much funnier,” Boreing said.

“With this, I was so incensed, not by Harry’s razors pulling their ads, which that’s just the market at work — if an advertiser wants to pull their ads out of our shows because they’re going through an economic hard time … the ads aren’t working, they just don’t like the cut of our jib, all of that is fair game,” he continued.

“If they attack us on their way out publicly — well, that’s just bad behavior. That’s rude behavior,” Boreing explained.

“We were good partners. We told our audience, leveraged our personal credibility to tell our audience about Harry’s razors, our conservative audience, by the way. Harry’s knew what they were getting, they knew what they were buying,” he continued. “And on their way out, they decided to virtue signal and respond to a tweet that had two followers, and say that we had ‘inexcusable views’ and a case of ‘values misalignment,’ and I thought, well, I still have the same audience I had yesterday, why don’t I tell that audience that Harry’s doesn’t want their business?”

As a press release from the company said on the day of its launch, “Jeremy’s Razors is more than a men’s grooming line. Jeremy’s Razors is a message to woke corporations that hate half the country, but love to take their money: your customers have the power to choose, and they’re not afraid to do so.”

Jeremy’s Razors added in a press release this week that the company “will begin accepting pre-orders for shaving kits today that customers can expect to be delivered by Father’s Day.” Pre-orders can be placed at ihateharrys.com.

According to the press release, the shaving kits include:

 A strong razor handle (not like the Beta stuff other brands use)
 Jeremy’s Green Tea & Menthol Shave Cream and Post Shave Balm, hand-selected by “the god-king”
 Eight razor cartridges
 A razor subscription to keep that mug looking fresh, forever

13,The Daily Wire,Fire Crews Rush To Extinguish Flames Inside NFL Stadium,C,"Empower Field at Mile High, home of the Denver Broncos, caught fire on Thursday as firefighters battled to get the blaze under control.

“Denver Fire Department crews are extinguishing a fire at Mile high stadium, 1701 Bryant. Unknown cause at this time, but fire affected [sic] has affected the suite are and the third level seating area,” the fire department wrote on Twitter. “Fire now under control at Mile high Stadium. Sprinklers attempted to stop the fire, but firefighters were needed to complete extinguishment. Heavy fire & smoke was found on our arrival media briefing to take place at 3:00 p.m. on east side of stadium.”



Ivan Rodriguez, a local news reporter, shared a video on social media that showed the fire starting when a single seat went up into flames.

“One man who was on a tour from Delaware visiting Empower Field for the first time gave me this video,” Rodriguez wrote. “Shows the fire starting with a single seat on fire. He says staff were quick and calm to evacuate them safely.”


No injuries were reported from the fire, which burned about 1,000 square feet.

Capt. Greg Pixley, a spokesman for the fire department, said, “This type of plastic that the seats are composed of burns with not only significant ferocity … but also produces a tremendous amount of black smoke.”


Empower Field at Mile High later said in a tweet, “A small fire that occurred in a construction zone near the East Club Lounge at Empower Field at Mile High has been contained by @Denver_Fire.”

“That area of the stadium was quickly evacuated as a precaution and there were no injuries sustained,” the tweet continued.

The Broncos recently made major news by acquiring Russell Wilson from the Seattle Seahawks.

The Daily Wire reported:

It’s one of the biggest trades in NFL history — at least in recent history — and immediately makes the Broncos a contender in a loaded AFC West. According to Schefter, the Broncos will receive Wilson and a fourth-round draft pick, in exchange for two first-round, two second-round, and a fifth-round draft pick, along with quarterback Drew Lock, tight end Noah Fant, and defensive lineman Shelby Harris. 

The trade ends a 10-year run in Seattle for Wilson, a run that resulted in the Seahawks’ first Super Bowl victory. Wilson has appeared in two Super Bowls and went 104-53-1 as the starting quarterback of the Seahawks. Wilson has thrown for 37,059 yards, 292 touchdowns and 87 interceptions in his career.

14,The Daily Wire,Country Legend Hank Williams Jr. Mourning Loss Of Wife Of More Than Thirty Years,C,"Country legend Hank Williams Jr. is mourning the loss of his wife of more than thirty years,  Mary Jane Thomas, following her death earlier this week.

A member of the country singer’s family confirmed that Thomas died on Tuesday in Jupiter, Florida, following a reported medical procedure, possibly involving a blood clot, reported TMZ.

A spokesperson for Jupiter Police Department said authorities responded to a medical call to the Jupiter Beach Resort & Spa around 5 p.m. on Tuesday, the outlet noted. Thomas was reportedly transported to a local hospital where she was pronounced dead. There have been mixed reports as to her age, from 58 to 61.


Williams and Thomas’ son Sam released a statement following her death, calling her a “beautiful soul” as he shared how much he will miss his “dear mama,” reported People magazine.

“My dear Mama Mary Jane was a beautiful soul who forever affected everyone who knew her,” Sam explained. “She had a smile and presence that lit up every room and she never met a stranger she didn’t befriend. Her spirit was gentle and giving. She could take down a ten-point buck and fix dinner for her grandchildren at the same time! Now she gets to radiate from above with my sister Katherine Diana right by her side.”

“She grew up competing in baton and cheerleading and was one of Hawaiian Tropic’s top models,” he added about his mom. “My father fell in love with the Daytona Beach beauty the minute he set eyes on her in the early ’80s. They went on to live the most powerful love story of travel and hunting and raising a family.”

“She is survived by my father, her two parents Ramona and Bill, her brother Andy, her sister Angela, myself and her three grandchildren: Beau Weston, Tennyson Hiram and Audrey Jane,” the “Family Traditions” hitmaker’s son continued. “Rest in peace Mama, I will always be the son of Mary Jane.”

Williams’ daughter Katherine died in a car crash in 2020, reported previously by the outlet. She was 27.

Hank and Thomas met at one of his concerts in 1985. They would tie the knot five years later in 1990 and were together until her death. Mary Jane was the country rockstar’s third wife, and the couple shared two kids together, son Sam and their late-daughter Katherine.

15,The Daily Wire,Pro-Life Sidewalk Counselor Testifies At Jackson Hearing,C,"On Thursday, a pro-life counselor testified at the Supreme Court confirmation hearing for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, detailing her role as a sidewalk counselor, sharing profound and moving stories about her work helping pregnant women.

Eleanor McCullen spoke to the committee, and described her efforts to tell women the options they have other than abortion.

She explained, “I have dedicated my life in service to empowering women as a sidewalk counselor. I was also the lead plaintiff in an important free speech case, McCullen Vs. Coakley.”

“So many women I’ve met believe that their only choice is to end the life of their baby. It is in that moment of isolation and fear that I have the privilege of offering a different choice, one that empowers and encourages the woman to know she is fully capable of becoming a mom and pursuing a job, and going to school, and having a successful and happy life,” she said.

“It’s a powerful moment when a woman looks at me and our eyes connect and she stops to talk. It’s in that moment I promise her she will never walk her journey alone,” she added.

She said that she tells them, “I will stand with you throughout the nine months and beyond. I will hold your hand.”

“I’m able to provide the mothers whatever resources they might need in that moment, including medical care, financial support, of course they come to our house, of course baby clothes and bassinets. I’ve had many, many, many, many baby showers,” she added, noting that they have been able to financially help mothers go back to school.

“And I just stick with the mothers and their families for as long as they need my help … and being able to watch the children grow up, children who wouldn’t be here had the mother not stopped to talk to me. This is an incredible privilege,” she said.

She explained how she knows the pain of being unable to serve women when the government attempts to step in and prohibit free speech.

She discussed a 2007 Massachusetts law that created a “buffer zone” around abortion facilities prohibiting pro-life speakers from coming within a certain distance of the facility. McCullen challenged the legislation in a lawsuit. She said the entire reason she challenged the law was because she didn’t want to shout from a distance or appear as if she didn’t have compassion.

She described how Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote an amicus brief as an attorney in support of Massachusetts’ previous buffer zone law enacted in 2000.

In 2014, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the Massachusetts law violated the First Amendment.

McCullen went on to tell a story about a woman who recently called her after finding her card in a baby scrapbook for her daughter, who is now eighteen years old and heading to college. The woman thanked McCullen for being there to talk to her, saying that her daughter is “the joy of our life.”

McCullen pressed Judge Jackson to uphold all Americans’ First Amendment freedoms if confirmed.

As The Daily Wire reported, while she was a lawyer, Jackson wrote an amicus brief in defense of a Massachusetts law that controlled actions within a certain distance of “reproductive health care” centers.

According to the brief:

The Massachusetts Act, however, regulates conduct only within eighteen feet of a “reproductive health care facility.”

Within that narrow zone, the Act makes it unlawful to “knowingly approach” within six feet of another person, without that person’s consent, “for the purpose of passing a leaflet or handbill to, displaying a sign to, or engaging in oral protest, education or counseling with such other person…”

The amicus brief also stated:

Contrary to the district court’s implication, the Act grew out of a sustained legislative effort to balance the free speech rights of abortion protesters against patients’ and providers’ right of access. The Legislature’s solution, developed by a working committee comprised of legislators with differing views on the issue, was a compromise: a statute that permits speakers on all sides of the abortion debate to voice their views about reproductive health services openly and vigorously, so long as, within an eighteen-foot radius of clinic entrances and driveways, such speakers do not approach within six feet of unconsenting individuals. This “floating bubble” legislation has the advantage of protecting the interests of everyone involved in the abortion debate: it allows free and open communication while at the same time enabling patients and staff members to proceed into the clinic unhindered.",https://www.dailywire.com/news/pro-life-sidewalk-counselor-testifies-at-jackson-hearing,3/24/2022
16,The Daily Wire,NCAA Ignores Outcry From Female Swimmers Over Biological Men In Women’s Sports,C,"The NCAA is apparently ignoring national outcry over the inclusion of a biologically male athlete in the recent NCAA Women’s Swimming Championships, staying silent despite concerns from swimmers, parents, and the public at large.

The Daily Wire has repeatedly reached out to the association regarding testimony from fathers and swimmers who protest against Lia Thomas, a biologically male athlete, swimming in female races.

Despite highly publicized calls for action from Virginia Tech swimmer Reka Gyorgy and University of Kentucky swimmer Riley Gaines — both of whom competed against Thomas and suffered for it, the NCAA has not responded to requests for comment.

Gyorgy placed 17th in the 500 freestyle, meaning that she did not make it back to the finals and was a first alternate. If Thomas, a biological male, had not participated, Gyorgy would have made it to the finals.

“I’m writing this letter right now in hopes that the NCAA will open their eyes and change these rules in the future,” she wrote in a letter to the NCAA that she released Sunday. “It doesn’t promote our sport in a good way and I think it is disrespectful against the biologically female swimmers who are competing in the NCAA.”

Gaines competed in the women’s 200 freestyle and tied for fifth place with Thomas. In an interview with The Daily Wire, she said she was made to hold the sixth-place trophy during award ceremony pictures, while Thomas was given the fifth-place trophy.

The swimmer believes that the NCAA was “trying to save face” in elevating Thomas in this situation, telling The Daily Wire that the experience was “disheartening” and that she “left the pool with no trophy.”

“Who are we trying to protect here?” she questioned, “and who are we trying to fight for here?”

The NCAA Board of Governors updated its transgender participation policy in January, requiring transgender athletes to document “sport-specific” testosterone levels within their sport’s approved range at the beginning of the season and ahead of championship selections.

“We are steadfast in our support of transgender student-athletes and the fostering of fairness across college sports,” John DeGioia, chair of the NCAA board and president of Georgetown University, said in a statement at the time.

“It is important that NCAA member schools, conferences and college athletes compete in an inclusive, fair, safe and respectful environment and can move forward with a clear understanding of the new policy,” he added.

But parents and athletes apparently do not find the move bold enough.

Linnea Saltz, a former NCAA track athlete who raced against a biological man, is not surprised that the NCAA has preserved silence on the matter since she brought her concerns to the association in 2019 with little results.

“Here we are today still dealing with the same issues,” she said.

Saltz told The Daily Wire on Thursday that she hoped that seeing the “overwhelming amount of individuals” affected by the NCAA’s decision would prompt the association to “finally make a decision that protects these women.”


“It is pertinent that the NCAA listen to these concerns as they are the governing body that is supposed to protect these athletes,” the former track athlete added. “This new NCAA narrative of inclusivity is exclusionary to women in sports.”

Saltz insisted: “If the issue is not addressed now, then when? It is clear a decision needs to be made as the situation will continue to worsen and more individuals will become affected if not.”

The NCAA’s silence on the matter perhaps indicates that the organization hopes outcry will die down and concerns over the issue will be forgotten.

But parents told The Daily Wire at the championships in Atlanta that the entire meet was abuzz with concerns and qualms about fairness in women’s sports.

“If the NCAA continues to sideline women and the accomplishments of female athletes, Congress must hold them accountable,” Annabelle Rutledge, national director for Young Women for America, told The Daily Wire. “And as American citizens, we must be relentless in our support of female athletes, calling on the Administration to uphold Title IX, and engaging with our state and federal members to hold the NCAA to account.”",https://www.dailywire.com/news/ncaa-ignores-outcry-from-female-swimmers-over-biological-men-in-womens-sports,3/24/2022
17,The Daily Wire,Democrats Fume After Supreme Court Sides With Republicans On Voting Map Issue,C,"The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday sided with Wisconsin Republicans challenging “redistricting” efforts from Democrats in the state, throwing out legislative maps drawn by Democratic Governor Tony Evers and adopted by its highest court, The Washington Post reported.

The Supreme Court granted a Republican request to block new maps that “increased the number of state Assembly districts with a majority of Black voters from six to seven,” Reuters reported. “The court sent that case back to the Wisconsin Supreme Court and ordered it to adopt new maps laying out the various districts.”

The Wisconsin Supreme Court “committed legal error in its application of decisions of this Court regarding the relationship between the constitutional guarantee of equal protection and the VRA (Voting Right Act),” the opinion said, adding that the state court “believed that it had to conclude only that the VRA might support race-based districting — not that the statute required it. … Our precedent instructs otherwise.”

“The question that our VRA precedents ask and the court failed to answer is whether a race-neutral alternative that did not add a seventh majority-black district would deny black voters equal political opportunity,” the majority wrote.

The Wisconsin court “is free to take additional evidence if it prefers to reconsider the Governor’s maps rather than choose from among the other submissions. Any new analysis, however, must comply with our equal protection jurisprudence,” it added.

Vox reported that the high court used a process known as “summary reversal” to toss the maps, “meaning that the Court tossed out the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s decision completely without receiving full briefing or hearing oral arguments.”

Liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan dissented from the majority.

“In an emergency posture, the Court summarily overturns a Wisconsin Supreme Court decision resolving a conflict over the State’s redistricting, a decision rendered after a 5-month process involving all interested stakeholders,” Sotomayor wrote, according to The Hill. “Despite the fact that summary reversals are generally reserved for decisions in violation of settled law, the Court today faults the State Supreme Court for its failure to comply with an obligation that, under existing precedent, is hazy at best.”

In a second unsigned ruling, “the court rejected a challenge from five Republican congressmen who objected to the congressional map adopted by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which had also been prepared by Mr. Evers, a Democrat,” The New York Times reported.

Democrats and their allies in the media fumed over the news, claiming it was an attack on “voting rights.”

“Today’s Supreme Court action in Wisconsin is simply wrong and is grounded in an unprecedented process and a failure to adhere to precedent,” former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder posted to social media. “The Court continues to put its legitimacy at risk.”


Left-wing site Slate called the ruling an “astonishing, inexplicable blow to the Voting Rights Act.”

Journalist John Nichols called the decision “stunning” and “wrong.”

“In a stunning decision that confirms just how extreme the US Supreme Court’s majority has become, #SCOTUS has rejected the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling that embraced [Governor Evers] ’ legislative district maps. Justice Sonia Sotomayor calls the ruling ‘unprecedented.’ It’s also wrong,” he wrote.

18,The Daily Wire,Top U.S. Senator Comes Out Against Biden SCOTUS Nominee: ‘Cannot and Will Not Support Judge Jackson’,C,"U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) announced on Thursday that he will not support President Joe Biden’s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, after coming into the process with “an open mind.”

“After studying the nominee’s record and watching her performance this week, I cannot and will not support Judge Jackson for a lifetime appointment to our highest Court,” McConnell said in a statement. “First, Judge Jackson refuses to reject the fringe position that Democrats should try to pack the Supreme Court. Justices Ginsburg and Breyer had no problem denouncing this unpopular view and defending their institution. I assumed this would be an easy softball for Judge Jackson. But it wasn’t.”

“The nominee suggested there are two legitimate sides to the issue,” he continued. “She testified that she has a view on the matter but would not share it. She inaccurately compared her non-answer to a different, narrower question that a prior nominee was asked. But Judge Jackson seemingly tipped her hand. She said she would be, ‘thrilled to be one of however many.’ The opposite of the Ginsburg and Breyer sentiment. The most radical pro-court-packing fringe groups badly wanted this nominee for this vacancy. Judge Jackson was the court-packers’ pick. And she testified like it.”

McConnell specifically took issue with Jackson’s stances on crime and illegal immigration in his statement.

“This is one area where Judge Jackson’s trial court records provide a wealth of information. And it is troubling,” McConnell said. “The Judge regularly gave certain terrible kinds of criminals light sentences that were beneath the sentencing guidelines and beneath the prosecutors’ requests. The Judge herself, this week, used the phrase ‘policy disagreement’ to describe this subject. The issue isn’t just the sentences. It’s also the Judge’s rhetoric in trial transcript and the creative ways she bent the law. In one instance, Judge Jackson used COVID as a pretext to essentially rewrite a criminal justice reform law from the bench and make it retroactive, which Congress had declined to do.”

“She did so to cut the sentence of a fentanyl trafficker while Americans died in huge numbers from overdoses,” he continued. “Judge Jackson declined to walk Senators through the merits of her reasoning in specific cases. She just kept repeating that it was her discretion, and if Congress didn’t like it, it was our fault for giving her the discretion. That is hardly an explanation as to why she uses her discretion the way she does. It was not reassuring to hear Judge Jackson essentially say that if Senators want her to be tough on crime, we need to change the law, take away her discretion, and force her to do it. That response just seems to confirm that deeply-held personal policy views seep into her jurisprudence. And that is exactly what the record suggests.”",https://www.dailywire.com/news/top-u-s-senator-comes-out-against-biden-scotus-nominee-cannot-and-will-not-support-judge-jackson,3/24/2022
