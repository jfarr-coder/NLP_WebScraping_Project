The Guardian,‘He helped shape the modern world’ Gif inventor Stephen Wilhite dies after getting Covid,C,"He created the image file format that defined an internet culture for decades in 1987 while working at CompuServe
If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a gif is worth millions. The image file format has been a defining element of internet culture for decades, with glass-raising DiCaprios and mic-dropping Obamas facilitating self-expression in a faceless digital world. And we have one man to thank for all the jokes, snark and praise: Stephen Wilhite, inventor of the gif, who died last week, aged 74.

Wilhite, who lived in Milford, Ohio, contracted Covid two weeks before his death, his wife, Kathaleen Wilhite, told NPR.

A lifelong coder, Stephen Wilhite created the gif in 1987 while working at CompuServe. The compressed image files were useful at a time when internet connections dragged. “If you want lossless, compressed graphics, there is nothing better than gif,” said Sandy Trevor, who managed Wilhite’s team, to the Daily Dot in 2012.
Wilhite “invented gif all by himself – he actually did that at home and brought it into work after he perfected it”, said Kathaleen Wilhite to the Verge. “He would figure out everything privately in his head and then go to town programming it on the computer.” It was his proudest achievement, she said.

The same year, an update led to animated graphics. “I think the first gif was a picture of a plane. It was a long time ago,” Stephen Wilhite told the Daily Dot in 2012. Indeed, according to Giphy, the go-to site for gif seekers, it was this image:

Wilhite worked for Compuserve until 2001, after he had a stroke. Meanwhile, gifs’ popularity took off, including on early social media sites such as MySpace. By 1996, the “dancing baby” image – one of Wilhite’s favorites, he told the New York Times – was plastered across the the web and attached to emails. In 2012, “gif” was dubbed word of the year by Oxford American Dictionaries. The next year, the New York Times called the format “the aesthetic calling card of modern Internet culture”.

That year, Wilhite received a Webby lifetime achievement award. Called to the stage, he maintained a poker face as he delivered an acceptance “speech” in an appropriate format:

Wilhite continued to code for the rest of his life. He was also passionate about model trains, Kathaleen Wilhite told NPR, and the couple were avid campers; he “loved travelling”, his obituary says. Beyond his work and his hobbies, “he was probably one of the kindest, humble men you’ve ever met,” Kathaleen Wilhite told the radio network. “People loved him and respected his work, and that would mean more to him than anything is how they respected what he did … I miss him more than anyone could imagine.”


Tributes poured in on his obituary page. “You changed the way we converse as a society, and immortalized countless moments that would otherwise be fleeting,” wrote one well-wisher. “Thank you for helping the modern world take shape,” wrote another.

Giphy offered a tribute of its own, hailing “the simplicity of the format, the power of the looping image. We are indebted to the creativity and vision of Mr Wilhite.”

For those who’d like to honor Wilhite’s memory themselves, there are plenty of gifs that pay tribute to their inventor. Perhaps even better, you can heed his unequivocal advice: pronounce it “jif”.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/24/stephen-wilhite-gif-inventor-dies,2022-03-24
The Guardian,Microplastics found in human blood for first time,C,"Exclusive: The discovery shows the particles can travel around the body and may lodge in organs

Microplastic pollution has been detected in human blood for the first time, with scientists finding the tiny particles in almost 80% of the people tested.

The discovery shows the particles can travel around the body and may lodge in organs. The impact on health is as yet unknown. But researchers are concerned as microplastics cause damage to human cells in the laboratory and air pollution particles are already known to enter the body and cause millions of early deaths a year.

Huge amounts of plastic waste are dumped in the environment and microplastics now contaminate the entire planet, from the summit of Mount Everest to the deepest oceans. People were already known to consume the tiny particles via food and water as well as breathing them in, and they have been found in the faeces of babies and adults.

The scientists analysed blood samples from 22 anonymous donors, all healthy adults and found plastic particles in 17. Half the samples contained PET plastic, which is commonly used in drinks bottles, while a third contained polystyrene, used for packaging food and other products. A quarter of the blood samples contained polyethylene, from which plastic carrier bags are made.

“Our study is the first indication that we have polymer particles in our blood – ​it’s a breakthrough result,” said Prof Dick Vethaak, an ecotoxicologist at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in the Netherlands. “But we have to extend the research and increase the sample sizes, the number of polymers assessed, etc.” Further studies by a number of groups are already under way, he said.

“It is certainly reasonable to be concerned,” Vethaak told the Guardian. “The particles are there and are transported throughout the body.” He said previous work had shown that microplastics were 10 times higher in the faeces of babies compared with adults and that babies fed with plastic bottles are swallowing millions of microplastic particles a day.

“We also know in general that babies and young children are more vulnerable to chemical and particle exposure,” he said. “That worries me a lot.”

The new research is published in the journal Environment International and adapted existing techniques to detect and analyse particles as small as 0.0007mm. Some of the blood samples contained two or three types of plastic. The team used steel syringe needles and glass tubes to avoid contamination, and tested for background levels of microplastics using blank samples.

Vethaak acknowledged that the amount and type of plastic varied considerably between the blood samples. “But this is a pioneering study,” he said, with more work now needed. He said the differences might reflect short-term exposure before the blood samples were taken, such as drinking from a plastic-lined coffee cup, or wearing a plastic face mask.

“The big question is what is happening in our body?” Vethaak said. “Are the particles retained in the body? Are they transported to certain organs, such as getting past the blood-brain barrier?” And are these levels sufficiently high to trigger disease? We urgently need to fund further research so we can find out.”

The new research was funded by the Dutch National Organisation for Health Research and Development and Common Seas, a social enterprise working to reduce plastic pollution.

“Plastic production is set to double by 2040,” said Jo Royle, founder of the charity Common Seas. “We have a right to know what all this plastic is doing to our bodies.” Common Seas, along with more than 80 NGOs, scientists and MPs, are asking the UK government to allocate £15m to research on the human health impacts of plastic. The EU is already funding research on the impact of microplastic on foetuses and babies, and on the immune system.

A recent study found that microplastics can latch on to the outer membranes of red blood cells and may limit their ability to transport oxygen. The particles have also been found in the placentas of pregnant women, and in pregnant rats they pass rapidly through the lungs into the hearts, brains and other organs of the foetuses.

A new review paper published on Tuesday, co-authored by Vethaak, assessed cancer risk and concluded: “More detailed research on how micro- and nano-plastics affect the structures and processes of the human body, and whether and how they can transform cells and induce carcinogenesis, is urgently needed, particularly in light of the exponential increase in plastic production. The problem is becoming more urgent with each day.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/24/microplastics-found-in-human-blood-for-first-time,2022-03-24
NBC News,"Russians 'killed entire families, adults and children and they tried to burn the bodies,' Zelenskyy told the U.N. Security Council",C,"WASHINGTON — Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday laid out atrocities committed by Russia in Ukraine in a powerful speech to the U.N. Security Council from Kyiv.

Zelenskyy said that he visited the city of Bucha near Kyiv on Monday and that the Russian military there had “searched for and purposely killed anyone who served our country.”

""They shot and killed women outside their houses,"" Zelenskyy said. ""They killed entire families, adults and children, and they tried to burn the bodies.""

The Ukrainian leader said civilians were fatally shot in the back of the heads after being tortured. Some were shot in the streets and thrown into wells and others were killed in their own apartments by grenades, he said.

“The civilians were crushed by tanks while sitting in their cars in the middle of the road,” he continued. “They cut off limbs, cut their throats, slashed their throats. Women were raped and killed in front of their children. Their tongues were pulled out only because the aggressor did not hear what they wanted to hear from them.”

Zelenskyy said these war crimes are no different than those committed by terrorist groups like the Islamic State.

“Where is the security that the Security Council needs to guarantee? It’s not there,” he said. “Where is the peace?”

Zelenskyy suggested that the Security Council cannot work effectively when Russia is one of its permanent members. “The world has yet to see what they have done in other occupied cities and regions of our country,” he said.

Russian soldiers are deliberately blocking cities, creating mass starvation, Zelenskyy said. He said they also shoot columns of civilians on the road who are trying to escape and blow up shelters where innocent people hide from airstrikes. Zelenskyy also said the Russian military had abducted more than 2,000 children and has been looting cities and villages it has captured.

“Do you think that the time of international law is gone? If your answer is no, then you need to act immediately,” Zelenskyy said. “The U.N. Charter must be restored immediately. The U.N. system must be reformed immediately.”

Zelenskyy proposed convening a global conference in Kyiv where countries can try to reform the global security system. He said the goals that nations set when it created the U.N. in 1945 “have not been achieved.”

He said the Security Council can remove Russia from its body so that “it cannot block decisions about its own aggression, its own war and then do everything that we can do to establish peace.” Or, he said, the U.N. can reform itself or dissolve itself altogether.

Afterward, Zelenskyy presented a graphic video that featured a montage of images of the dead in the streets of Ukraine — burned, charred bodies, piled on top of one another, and one with a dog that was alive lying down next to it.",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/zelenskyy-criticizes-united-nations-inaction-details-atrocities-ukrain-rcna23047,2022-04-05
NBC News,U.S. also announces new sanctions against Russia as Biden meets with world leaders for a series of emergency summits,C,"Coverage on this live blog has ended, please click here for the latest developments.

The U.S. has announced new sanctions against Russia and said it would welcome 100,000 refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine as President Joe Biden met with world leaders for a series of emergency summits.

The war has caused a humanitarian and refugee crisis, with more than 10 million people displaced, including 4.3 million children — more than half of the country's child population, according to the U.N.

Biden said Thursday that Russia should be removed from the G-20, the group that represents 20 of the world's largest economies, as Western allies gathered in Europe to discuss new support for Kyiv.

That includes imposing further punishment on Moscow one month after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched Europe's biggest conflict since World War II.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged an increase in military aid for his country in an address at the NATO summit in Brussels via video link. His ability to rally countries to Kyiv’s cause in video messages from the capital has served as a symbol of Ukraine’s defiant defense and Russia’s struggling advance.

Biden and U.S. allies were also set to discuss moves to bolster NATO’s eastern flank and how to counter the prospect of escalation from the Kremlin amid fears of a chemical or even nuclear attack.

The White House has established a team of national security officials to plan scenarios should Putin use chemical weapons, a senior administration official said.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/ukraine-russia-war-live-updates-biden-meet-nato-allies-n1292873,2022-03-25
NBC News,"Almost 2 in 5 Covid-19 researchers have faced harassment, survey finds",C,"Harassment of researchers and public health officials during the pandemic has become a growing concern and a focus for professional organizations.

Nearly 2 in 5 Covid-19 researchers reported they had been harassed since the pandemic began, according to a new survey published Thursday in Science.

The survey included responses from 510 researchers who have published about Covid-19 and was conducted by the news team of the journal Science. 

The survey, which has not gone through a peer review process, found that 38 percent of those researchers had experienced harassment of some kind. Before the pandemic, 71 percent of respondents said they received less harassment or no abuse at all. 

Researchers reported personal insults and attacks on their professional capabilities as the most common types of harassment. Other types of abuse — such as threats of harm, physical intimidation and doxxing — were reported more rarely. Eighteen scientists — about 3.5 percent of those surveyed — said they received death threats. 

Scientists with public stances on politicized topics — including those against the use of the drug ivermectin — were more likely to experience harassment, the Science analysis suggested. 

Science asked nearly 9,600 researchers for their perspective, and it’s possible the results are skewed by those who chose to respond. 

Harassment of researchers and public health officials during the pandemic has become a growing concern and a focus for professional organizations.

A survey by Nature, which included responses from 321 researchers who discussed Covid-19 in the media, found that 81 percent reported receiving personal attacks, 22 percent had received threats of physical or sexual violence and 15 percent received death threats.

A Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health study published last week found widespread reports of harassment among local public health departments. 

In survey data collected by the National Association of County and City Health Officials, researchers found 57 percent of health departments reported harassment during the first 11 months of the pandemic, with 1,499 unique cases reported.",https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/almost-2-5-covid-19-researchers-faced-harassment-rcna21060,2022-03-24
NBC News,Pfizer recalls some high blood pressure drugs over possible cancer risk,C,"The company recalled six lots of its Accuretic tablets, as well as authorized generics distributed by Greenstone.

Pfizer, the pharmaceutical company behind one of the Covid-19 vaccines, recalled certain lots of its high blood pressure medication for containing high levels of nitrosamines, which can lead to increased cancer risk.

The company announced a nationwide recall Monday and said it was pulling six lots of its Accuretic tablets.

It also pulled authorized generics distributed by its Greenstone subsidiary directly to patients — one lot of quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and four lots of quinapril HCl/ hydrochlorothiazide tablets.

Pfizer said nitrosamines are in food and water, including cured and grilled meats, dairy products and vegetables. But its medication was found to contain levels of nitrosamines that are higher than the acceptable daily intake level.

""Pfizer places the utmost emphasis on patient safety and product quality at every step in the manufacturing and supply chain process,"" the company said in a news release. ""Pfizer has notified direct consignees by letter to arrange for return of any recalled product.""

The lots were distributed nationwide from November 2019 to this month. Pfizer said that it was not aware of any reports of adverse events related to the recall and that the Food and Drug Administration was aware of the situation.

""The products have a safety profile that has been established over 20 years of marketing authorization and through a robust clinical program,"" the company said.

""Pfizer believes the benefit/risk profile of the products remains positive based on currently available data. Although long-term ingestion of N-nitroso-quinapril may be associated with a potential increased cancer risk in humans, there is no immediate risk to patients taking this medication.""

People who have been taking the medication should talk with their doctors about other options.

The presence of nitrosamines in blood pressure drugs has resulted in at least one other recall. In 2019, the FDA expanded a recall to include 32 lots of losartan, a drug sold by Macleods Pharmaceuticals, after they were found to contain unacceptable levels of the compounds.",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/pfizer-recalls-high-blood-pressure-drugs-possible-cancer-risk-rcna21346,2022-03-24
NBC News,Michigan school board president removed after she's accused of beating treasurer,C,"“She grabbed the top of my head and then slammed my head into the table and started punching my head,"" saidLaura MacIntyre, a member and the treasurer of the Flint board.

A Michigan school board president is accused of choking and punching a board member during a meeting before she was removed as the board’s leader, officials said Thursday.

The incident occurred at an otherwise ""mundane"" gathering Wednesday morning in Flint, said Laura MacIntyre, a member and the treasurer of the board, who was leading a meeting about finance issues.

MacIntyre said she was managing the order of comments from board members when Flint Board of Education President Danielle Green exploded.

""Very, very mundane. So mundane I don't even remember what it was that set her off,"" MacIntyre said Thursday.

Green walked to MacIntyre's seat ""and got up right above me, towered over me and started wagging her finger at me,"" MacIntyre said.

""And I stood up, in surprise, to step back from her — at which point she grabbed my throat and started choking me,"" MacIntyre said. ""She grabbed the top of my head and then slammed my head into the table and started punching my head.""

Green did not reply to multiple requests for comment Thursday.

There was no obvious spark for the attack, said school board counsel Charis Lee, a spokeswoman for the district.

""I was just told it was not provoked by individuals who saw it,"" Lee said Thursday.

Later in the day, trustees removed Green as president but not from the board itself.

There's no mechanism to recall a Flint school board member, and only the governor would have such power, Lee and MacIntyre said

A representative for Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

MacIntyre said she was treated by her physician Wednesday and was in concussion protocol Thursday.

“I’m physically in a lot of pain and struggling,” she said.

There have been no arrests, and the incident is being investigated, Flint Police Detective-Sgt. Tyrone Booth said.

""I can't say that an assault” at a school board meeting “was one that I can recall,"" Booth said. ""Obviously, there are emotional issues that a school board discusses, and sometimes temperatures and personal temperatures go up a little. But I can't say that I can recall an assault that's taken place.""

MacIntyre said she'll seek a restraining order against Green. The next school board meeting is set for April 13.

The two board members have known each other for years and have had no friction, MacIntyre said.

NBC News,Native American activist imprisoned for nearly half a century makes push for clemency,C,"Peltier, 77, has been held since 1977 for the deaths of two FBI agents. He maintains his innocence, and supporters say he deserves to be released on compassionate grounds.

Leonard Peltier, the Native American activist who has been imprisoned for nearly half a century for the murders of two FBI agents he has always maintained he didn't commit, is hopeful he'll have a chance to clear his name before he dies.

Peltier, 77, wants President Joe Biden to review his case and grant him clemency so he won't die in prison.

He's not looking for a presidential pardon, because it would be granted for a crime he insists he is innocent of.

Instead, he wants a new trial.

“If I get into court, if the judge is fair, how are they going to answer all of that?” he said of evidence that was withheld from the 1977 proceedings. “I want to get a trial.""

Recent calls from Peltier's supporters and family for him to be released have noted his failing health, including a recent bout of Covid-19.

""They're going to try and make me die here,"" Peltier said by phone Wednesday from his federal prison in Central Florida, his first media interview since 2016. ""I have a last few years, and I got to fight.""

Peltier's family says he is struggling with diabetes, hypertension, partial blindness from a stroke and an abdominal aortic aneurysm and that he tested positive for Covid in late January at the Federal Correctional Complex Coleman’s high-security facility.

Peltier said he was vaccinated against the coronavirus before he tested positive and that his chest, neck and head had hurt for a few days. He got a booster shot after he left 10 days of quarantine, he said.

The roughest part, he said, was being isolated and not receiving adequate care. He felt ""cold,"" and ""the food was bad,"" he said, adding, ""That was worse than getting Covid.""

Having spent years in prison mulling over his case and the various legal rulings, Peltier said there is evidence he'd like to present to show he didn't fire the bullets that killed the agents in a chaotic shootout on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota in June 1975.

""My lawyer said if I were tried today, they would never get away with it,"" he said.

His attorney, Kevin Sharp, a former federal judge, said Peltier has exhausted his appeals and that there remains no actual process for him to get a new trial unless federal prosecutors decide to reopen the case.

""They wouldn't do that, because there's no evidence to convict him on,"" Sharp said. ""He was convicted on aiding and abetting murder, but who did he aid and abet? His co-defendants were acquitted based on self-defense.""

Over the decades, criminal justice reform advocates have continued to highlight his arrest and conviction, saying it symbolizes systemic problems with how Native Americans are treated in the justice system, as well as imprisoned at higher rates by the federal government compared to other racial groups.

Human rights organizations and prominent political and religious figures, including Pope Francis and the Dalai Lama and other Nobel Peace Prize recipients, such as Nelson Mandela and Bishop Desmond Tutu, are reported to have called for Peltier's release.

Peltier's case has drawn scrutiny from those living on the Pine Ridge reservation, as well as members of his tribe, the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa. Other Native American activists and groups also believe Peltier is innocent and was made a scapegoat by the federal government in its pursuit to hold someone accountable for the agents' deaths.

But he has consistently been denied parole — in 2009, federal prosecutors said he was ""an unrepentant, cold-blooded murderer"" — and he isn't eligible again until 2024. In October, 11 members of Congress petitioned the Biden administration to grant clemency based on compassionate grounds.

Rep. Raúl Grijalva, D-Ariz., a clemency supporter, said he spoke with Peltier by phone after he learned Peltier had Covid. Grijalva's office said last month that Peltier described ""difficulties receiving adequate medical attention and gaining access to basic needs, like water.""

The Justice Department's Bureau of Prisons declined to comment on Peltier's case, citing privacy and security reasons. It said that it makes ""every effort"" to ensure the safety of inmates and that at Coleman, every inmate is given access to drinking water, adequate medical care and food.

Sharp said he believes Peltier's age, health and recent illness make him a prime candidate for release and that his clean and nonviolent prison record also indicates he isn't a threat to the public.

The number of inmates with Covid at federal prisons reached its peak around the time Peltier contracted the coronavirus, with close to 10,000 of them testing positive, according to Justice Department data. Active cases have dropped to about 100 this week, but Sharp believes Peltier is still at risk.

""Leonard Peltier is incapable of protecting himself. And if you're not going to do it, BOP, let him go home,"" Sharp said, referring to the Bureau of Prisons. ""This is where justice and mercy meet. Grant him clemency and send him home.""

It's unclear how familiar Biden is with Peltier's case, which has spawned hundreds of pages of FBI files; several books, including his own memoir, published in 1999; and the 1992 documentary ""Incident at Oglala,"" which was narrated by Robert Redford.

The FBI said in a statement Thursday that it remains ""resolute against the commutation of Leonard Peltier's sentence"" and that ""we must never forget or put aside that Peltier intentionally and mercilessly murdered these two young men and has never expressed remorse for his ruthless actions.""

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

Asked in January whether Biden was reviewing a request to commute Peltier's sentence, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters, ""I don't have anything to predict for you.""

In recent weeks, Democrats have tried to appeal to Biden. The Democratic National Committee's Native American Caucus wrote in a letter last week that Peltier's continued incarceration ""symbolizes the decades-old racial injustice towards Native Americans,"" HuffPost reported.

The encounter that led Peltier to prison involved a pair of FBI agents, Jack Coler and Ron Williams, who went onto a compound on the Pine Ridge reservation to arrest a man on a federal warrant in connection with the theft of a pair of cowboy boots, according to the agency's investigative files.

Peltier was a member of the American Indian Movement, a grassroots activist organization that began in Minneapolis in the 1960s to challenge police brutality and the oppression of Native Americans' rights. He was at Pine Ridge in 1975 in the wake of a drawn-out protest two years earlier at Wounded Knee, South Dakota, where armed American Indian Movement activists and Oglala Sioux tribal members had occupied the town and clashed with federal law enforcement officers. Two activists were killed.

On the day Coler and Williams were at Pine Ridge, they radioed that they had come under fire. It's unclear who pulled the trigger first; the FBI said the men were in a shootout that lasted 10 minutes. Both men were killed by bullets fired at close range. According to the FBI, Peltier was identified as the only person in possession of a weapon that could fire the type of bullet that killed them.

Dozens of people participated in the gunfight; at trial, two co-defendants were acquitted after they claimed self-defense. When Peltier was tried separately in 1977, no witnesses were presented who could identify him as the shooter, and unbeknown to his defense lawyers at the time, the federal government had withheld a ballistics report indicating the fatal bullets didn't come from his weapon, Sharp said.

""My co-defendants were found not guilty in self-defense, and I'm the one doing all this time,"" Peltier said.

The FBI maintains his conviction was ""rightly and fairly obtained"" and ""has withstood numerous appeals to multiple courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court.""

The incident is seen as an emblematic struggle between Native Americans and the federal government, particularly on Indigenous lands, and it has long rankled Indigenous activists who say the killing of a Native American man in the shootout was never formally investigated.

Over the years, former FBI agents have pushed back against Peltier's claim of innocence and bid for clemency. When Peltier's family sought help from President Bill Clinton, then-FBI Director Louis Freeh wrote in a letter that ""ignoring for a moment, the extreme and remorseless brutality of the acts themselves, our employees see Peltier's crimes as a complete affront to our cherished system of government under the rule of law.""

In a rare public demonstration by members of the FBI, about 500 active and retired agents and staff members marched to the White House to protest any action by Clinton.

But last year, retired federal prosecutor James Reynolds, who supervised Peltier's post-trial sentencing and appeals, broke from the federal government's position.

He wrote in a letter to Biden that ""we were not able to prove that Mr. Peltier personally committed any offense on the Pine Ridge Reservation."" He also underscored a long-held belief that Peltier was treated differently at the time because of a ""broken relationship between Native Americans and the government"" and that he was prosecuted with ""minimal evidence"" that ""I strongly doubt would be upheld in any court today.""

Peltier said Wednesday he was grateful for Reynolds' letter.

""If I could say to him: 'Thank you for finally coming forward. ... I thank you for your courage, and I hope that you can prevent this from ever happening to anyone else.'""

Two of Peltier's adult children said in interviews that they would like a meeting with the White House now so Biden can understand his case and why they believe his release is warranted.

""I know that Joe and Jill Biden are compassionate to the Native peoples,"" said his daughter Kathy Peltier, who lives in Los Angeles. ""I think seeing the family would make them see him as a real person, and we can explain what he's facing so it hits a little harder for them.""

Kathy Peltier said she had been hopeful that past administrations would listen. But the presidencies of Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump came and went.

In December 2016, Leonard Peltier's youngest son, Wahacanka Paul Shields-Peltier, died on a trip to Washington, D.C., advocating for his father's release. He was 41.

He died in the waning days of Obama's second term, when the family remained optimistic that the president would grant Peltier clemency.

With the loss of her brother and the realization that her father would never get to see him again, Kathy Peltier was in shock.

Kathy Peltier said that on the day Obama left office after having commuted hundreds of sentences — by far the most of any recent president — she turned off her phone and refused to leave her bedroom.

""I shut out the world,"" she said.

Kathy Peltier, 46, has known her father only as a federal prisoner. She said it has been difficult to come to terms with how he has missed out on his family's lives. He has six surviving children and a dozen great-grandchildren.

Peltier's oldest son, Chauncey Peltier, 56, who lives in Oregon, previously saw his father in 2015, when he visited him in prison. To channel his emotions, Leonard Peltier took up oil painting featuring Native American themes and iconography.

""The family prays every day and hopes he gets to go home, but some of us aren't hopeful it will ever happen,"" he said. ""In his children's eyes, Leonard wasn't the only one robbed.""

Leonard Peltier hasn't painted in a couple of years amid Covid restrictions in prison. But, he said, the art studio will be opening up again, and he hopes to pick up a brush in the next week.

To all of his supporters, including those who have helped with his legal defense, he said, he is thankful they haven't forgotten him and hopes their messages to the White House are heard.

""One of the elders, when I was convicted and I was going to leave the courtroom, she stood by the railing and said: 'They don't know who they did this to. We will be here the rest of our lives,'"" Peltier said. ""And they have been.

""I would love to go home,"" he added. ""My family wants to take care of me. My tribe wants to take care of me.""

McConnell suggested in his remarks that he thought Jackson would be an activist judge, and he faulted her for not taking a position on court packing — adding justices to the nine-member Supreme Court.

“Judge Jackson refuses to reject the fringe position that Democrats should try to pack the Supreme Court,” McConnell said, adding that the question should have been “an easy softball” for her, “but it wasn’t.”

Jackson noted during her confirmation hearing that Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a conservative judge whom McConnell championed for the Supreme Court in 2020, sidestepped a similar question during her hearing, saying she wouldn’t “opine” on the issue.

McConnell noted that liberal justices like Stephen Breyer and the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg “had no problem denouncing this unpopular view and defending their institution.” The two justices made those remarks after they were on the court.

He added that Jackson “seemingly actually tipped her hand” during her testimony this week. “She said she would be ‘thrilled to be one of however many.’ However many,” McConnell said.

“Nothing we saw this week convinced me that President Biden’s or Judge Jackson’s far-left fan club had misjudged her. I will vote against this nominee on the Senate floor,” he said.

The Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to vote on Jackson's nomination April 4, setting up a likely vote in the full Senate later in the month. No Democratic-voting senators have indicated they would oppose her.

McConnell had not been expected to back President Joe Biden's historic pick — he voted against Jackson's nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for Washington, D.C., last year — but Thursday's announcement could open the floodgates for other GOP senators to follow suit and potentially set up a party-line vote for Jackson, who would be the first Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court.

The Senate confirmed Jackson last year to her current post by a vote of 53-44, with support from just three Republicans: Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.

Graham, however, was openly antagonistic toward Jackson at her confirmation hearings this week, criticizing her sentencings in child pornography cases.

Graham, who has yet to reveal how he plans to vote, said Thursday, ""I'm inclined to vote for nominees,"" but suggested he might hold Jackson to different standard for the Supreme Court than he did for the federal appeals court. ""I thought she was qualified to be on the circuit court. This is a different game,"" he said.

Asked whether that meant he would vote against her, Graham said, “Now just stay tuned.""",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/mcconnell-vote-jacksons-supreme-court-nomination-rcna21460,2022-03-24
NBC News,Arizona Legislature passes 15-week abortion ban,C,"The bill now goes to Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, who has signed every piece of anti-abortion legislation that has reached his desk since he took office in 2015.
PHOENIX — The Arizona Legislature on Thursday joined the growing list of Republican-led states to pass aggressive anti-abortion legislation as the conservative U.S. Supreme Court is considering ratcheting back abortion rights that have been in place for nearly 50 years.

The House voted on party lines to outlaw abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, mirroring a Mississippi law now being considered by the nation’s high court.

The bill explicitly says it does not overrule a state law in place for more than 100 years that would ban abortion outright if the Supreme Court overrules Roe v. Wade, the 1973 case that enshrined the right to abortion in law.

The bill now goes to Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, an abortion opponent who has signed every piece of anti-abortion legislation that has reached his desk since he took office in 2015.

Florida lawmakers have passed a similar 15-week abortion ban early this month that Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis is expected to sign. A bill in West Virginia failed to pass the state Senate by the time its legislative session ended earlier this month after passing the House.

An Arizona proposal that would outlaw abortion after about six weeks has not advanced. A bill enacted in Texas last year allows private citizens to enforce the ban, and the Supreme Court refused to block it. Idaho’s governor signed a copycat bill this week. Those measures are unique in that they allow private citizens to file civil lawsuits against anyone who helps someone else get an abortion after six weeks. It has made legal challenges difficult because the government is not involved in enforcement.

The Arizona 15-week abortion ban bill contains no exceptions for rape or incest or for a medical emergency.

“I am becoming more frightened by the moment by this bill,” Democratic Rep. Mitzi Epstein said during Thursday’s floor debate. “I’m terrified that this bill would outlaw health care for a woman having a naturally occurring and tragic and horrible miscarriage and they would not be allowed to get this health care.”

Republican backers said little during the floor debate.

Minority Democrats have said the measure is unconstitutional and that any ban would disproportionately impact poor and minority women who won’t be able to travel to states without strict abortion laws.

But Sen. Nancy Barto, the Republican sponsor of the bill, has said she hopes the high court upholds Mississippi’s law banning abortion after 15 weeks.

“The state has an obligation to protect life, and that is what this bill is about,” Barto said during Senate debate last month.

The debate and vote on the 15-week abortion ban came the same morning that the House also debated a ban on transgender girls from playing on the high school or college sports team that aligns with their gender identity. The House voted Thursday to pass a bill banning gender reassignment surgery for anyone younger than 18.

Arizona already has some of the nation’s most restrictive abortion laws, including one that would automatically outlaw it if the high court fully overturns Roe.

Republicans hope to put the 15-week ban in place so it takes effect quickly if the Supreme Court further limits abortion rights but stops short of fully overturning Roe. The measure closely mirrors the Mississippi law.

Under current abortion rulings, abortion is legal until the point a fetus can survive outside the womb, which is usually around 24 weeks.

Barto’s bill would make it a crime for a doctor to perform an abortion after 15 weeks but would prohibit the prosecution of pregnant people for receiving one. Doctors could face felony charges and lose their license to practice medicine. There is an exception for cases when the mother is at risk of death or serious permanent injury, but not for instances of rape or incest.

Of the 13,186 abortions performed in Arizona in 2020, 636 were after 15 weeks of pregnancy, according to the latest data from the Arizona Department of Health Services.",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/arizona-legislature-passes-15-week-abortion-ban-rcna21478,2022-03-24
NBC News,Supreme Court says spiritual advisers can touch prisoners at the time of execution,C,"A Texas inmate said the state is violating his religious rights by refusing to let his pastor pray audibly with him or perform a laying-on of hands inside the execution chamber.  

Federal law gives prisoners facing execution the right to have a spiritual adviser in the death chamber who can pray aloud and touch them, the Supreme Court ruled Thursday.  

The ruling came in the case of a Texas inmate, John Henry Ramirez, whose lethal injection was scheduled for September last year but was blocked by the court to consider his appeal. He said the state violated his religious rights by refusing to let his pastor pray audibly with him or perform a tradition known as the laying-on of hands.  

The state’s refusal, the court said, meant Ramirez “will be unable to engage in protected religious exercise in the final moments of his life.”

The 8-1 decision was written by Chief Justice John Roberts and joined by all but Clarence Thomas, who said Ramirez was merely trying to “'manipulate the judicial process' to win further delay” in carrying out the death sentence.

Texas allows spiritual advisers to pray with and counsel an inmate until the prisoner is taken into the lethal injection chamber. Preventing them from speaking or touching an inmate from that point on preserved the execution team’s ability to detect signs of distress, the state said.

But the court said the state’s categorial ban was too restrictive. 

“We do not see how letting the spiritual advisor stand slightly closer, reach out his arm, and touch part of the prisoner’s body well away from the side of any IV line would meaningfully increase risk,” Roberts wrote.

Roberts cited a history of clerical prayer at the time of an execution, from the early 1700s in England to the execution of conspirators in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, and to the execution of Nazi war criminals after World War II.

In recent years, the Supreme Court has been receptive to claims that states improperly denied the religious freedom of inmates facing the death penalty. It blocked a scheduled execution in 2019 of another Texas inmate who said his religious freedom was violated because his Buddhist spiritual adviser wasn’t allowed to be with him.

In response, Texas banned all spiritual advisers from the execution chamber. Then in 2020, the Supreme Court stayed the execution of a Texas inmate challenging the no-advisers policy, so the state changed its policy again but retained the prohibition on praying aloud or touching. 

Ramirez said that both he and his pastor believed that people either ascend to heaven or descend to damnation at the moment of death. He contended that denying him the traditional ministrations by his pastor violated his religious freedom.

Texas said its protocol balanced many factors, including maintaining uniformity in executions to reduce the opportunity for errors, protecting the safety and privacy of execution personnel and the rights of the inmate, and providing closure for the victim’s family and the community.

Nine states — Arizona, Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, Montana, South Dakota and Utah — urged the court to side with Texas. “The safety and security of state execution protocols should not be subject to federal court micromanagement,” they said in a friend-of-court brief. 

But several religious organizations, including the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, said the Texas prohibition burdens the religious freedom not only of inmates, but also of their pastors in carrying out key actions of the ministry. 

Ramirez was sentenced to death for fatally stabbing a man 29 times during a convenience store robbery following a drug binge. He fled to Mexico but was later arrested and brought back for trial.

In the Supreme Court, he did not seek to challenge either his conviction or his death sentence.",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-says-spiritual-advisers-can-touch-prisoners-time-executi-rcna21374,2022-03-24
The Guardian,World Cup roundup/ Italy knocked out by North Macedonia in dramatic finale,C,"Aleksandar Trajkovski’s goal knocks out European champions
North Macedonia now face Portugal, who beat Turkey 3-1

Italy missed out on the World Cup finals again after losing 1-0 at home to North Macedonia in their playoff semi-final as Aleksandar Trajkovski’s last-gasp strike earned the visitors a famous win.

Italy did not qualify for the World Cup four years ago, missing out for the first time since 1958, but the European champions dominated from the off in Palermo. The hosts became more desperate in their search for a winner after the break, however, as chances continued to come and go before, in stoppage time, Trajkovski arrowed in a stunning winner to spark wild North Macedonian celebrations.

Italy's João Pedro agonising after missing one of 32 shots on the North Macedonia goal in Palermo

Roberto Mancini’s Italy side had 32 efforts at goal in the match but somehow fell short, with North Macedonia going on to play Portugal in the playoff final on Tuesday for a place in Qatar.

“It is a huge disappointment,” the Italy midfielder Jorginho said. “It hurts, it hurts so much. We have always created and dominated matches but we have not been able to finish teams off. It is not to blame anyone in particular but it is the reality.

“I don’t know why we haven’t been able to do this, I am also involved in this, and it hurts me to think about it.”

Without the veteran pairing Leonardo Bonucci and Giorgio Chiellini through injury, Italy’s makeshift defence was barely troubled in the first half, as all the action took place down the other end.

Domenico Berardi had the best of the openings, having been presented with the ball after the North Macedonia goalkeeper Stole Dimitrievski misplaced a pass, but his shot was tame, with Dimitrievski getting back to make the save. Ciro Immobile also wasted a glorious first-half chance for Italy when blazing over the bar from a good position.

Berardi was again guilty of profligacy after the break, shooting over when he should have hit the target, and with their only meaningful attack of the match North Macedonia seized their chance. Italy did not look to be in too much danger, but Trajkovski, who plays in Saudi Arabia for Al-Fayha, wrote his name into North Macedonian football folklore with a shot that crept inside the post to stun the home fans.

Portugal moved into the final with a 3-1 win over Turkey, for whom Burak Yilmaz skied a penalty five minutes from full time that would have drawn the sides level.

Roared on by a sold-out Estádio do Dragão in Porto, Portugal dominated the game from the start and went 2-0 up in the first half after Otavio scored one goal and created another for Diogo Jota before half-time. But Fernando Santos’s side were pegged back by a Yilmaz goal in the 65th minute that put the Portuguese fans on the edge of their seats as Turkey started to threaten.

José Fonte then fouled Enes Unal inside the area in the 85th minute to concede a penalty given by VAR but Yilmaz fired it high over the bar. The Portugal substitute Matheus Nunes relieved the pressure on the hosts in added time with their third goal from a counterattack.

The Sweden substitute Robin Quaison struck in the second half of extra time to secure a 1-0 win over the Czech Republic and set up a clash away to Poland.

The Czechs had an early goal ruled out for a foul and the Swedes had the lion’s share of possession for most of the playoff semi-final, but the two sides struggled to break each other down in a game full of tough tackling and wayward passing.

The substitute Mattias Svanberg went closest for the Swedes in normal time, but his header from Emil Forsberg’s corner was aimed straight at the visiting goalkeeper Tomas Vaclik.

The game finished scoreless after 90 minutes and appeared to be heading for penalties when Quaison danced through the middle of the defence before exchanging passes with Alexander Isak and coolly slotting home to move his side a step closer to Qatar.",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/24/world-cup-roundup-italy-north-macedonia-portugal-turkey,2022-03-24
The Daily Wire,"‘We’ve Sold 25,000 Razor Subscriptions In Our First Three Days’: Daily Wire CEO Joins Tim Pool To Discuss Jeremy’s Razors, Woke Corporations",C,"On Thursday night, co-CEO of The Daily Wire Jeremy Boreing sat down live in-studio for an interview with Tim Pool, popular podcaster and host of TimCast IRL, to discuss The Daily Wire’s latest venture — Jeremy’s Razors, a new company launched by The Daily Wire in response to Harry’s razors pulling its advertising from The Daily Wire in 2021. Boreing also talked about the success of Jeremy’s Razors, announcing that the company had sold 25,000 razor subscriptions in just three days.

Jeremy’s Razors also released a multi-million dollar marketing campaign, and its first ad, which features the McLaren-driving “god-king” Boreing walking through The Daily Wire’s headquarters and torching a pack of Harry’s razors. It has received more than one million views on Twitter.

The ad also caught the eye of Pool, who praised the ad as “one of the funniest commercials ever.” He added that the whole idea was “brilliant” and that “The Daily Wire knows the power of culture” during a segment of his podcast.

On Thursday, Pool had Boreing on Timcast IRL to discuss Jeremy’s Razors and why a company like this was necessary.

“The most amazing thing about [this is] … this is my first time on the show, and my first time to share this information publicly — we’ve sold 25,000 razor subscriptions in our first three days as a company, which is an amazing thing, obviously, and it makes the joke much funnier,” Boreing said.

“With this, I was so incensed, not by Harry’s razors pulling their ads, which that’s just the market at work — if an advertiser wants to pull their ads out of our shows because they’re going through an economic hard time … the ads aren’t working, they just don’t like the cut of our jib, all of that is fair game,” he continued.

“If they attack us on their way out publicly — well, that’s just bad behavior. That’s rude behavior,” Boreing explained.

“We were good partners. We told our audience, leveraged our personal credibility to tell our audience about Harry’s razors, our conservative audience, by the way. Harry’s knew what they were getting, they knew what they were buying,” he continued. “And on their way out, they decided to virtue signal and respond to a tweet that had two followers, and say that we had ‘inexcusable views’ and a case of ‘values misalignment,’ and I thought, well, I still have the same audience I had yesterday, why don’t I tell that audience that Harry’s doesn’t want their business?”

As a press release from the company said on the day of its launch, “Jeremy’s Razors is more than a men’s grooming line. Jeremy’s Razors is a message to woke corporations that hate half the country, but love to take their money: your customers have the power to choose, and they’re not afraid to do so.”

Jeremy’s Razors added in a press release this week that the company “will begin accepting pre-orders for shaving kits today that customers can expect to be delivered by Father’s Day.” Pre-orders can be placed at ihateharrys.com.

According to the press release, the shaving kits include:

 A strong razor handle (not like the Beta stuff other brands use)
 Jeremy’s Green Tea & Menthol Shave Cream and Post Shave Balm, hand-selected by “the god-king”
 Eight razor cartridges
 A razor subscription to keep that mug looking fresh, forever

The Daily Wire,Fire Crews Rush To Extinguish Flames Inside NFL Stadium,C,"Empower Field at Mile High, home of the Denver Broncos, caught fire on Thursday as firefighters battled to get the blaze under control.

“Denver Fire Department crews are extinguishing a fire at Mile high stadium, 1701 Bryant. Unknown cause at this time, but fire affected [sic] has affected the suite are and the third level seating area,” the fire department wrote on Twitter. “Fire now under control at Mile high Stadium. Sprinklers attempted to stop the fire, but firefighters were needed to complete extinguishment. Heavy fire & smoke was found on our arrival media briefing to take place at 3:00 p.m. on east side of stadium.”



Ivan Rodriguez, a local news reporter, shared a video on social media that showed the fire starting when a single seat went up into flames.

“One man who was on a tour from Delaware visiting Empower Field for the first time gave me this video,” Rodriguez wrote. “Shows the fire starting with a single seat on fire. He says staff were quick and calm to evacuate them safely.”


No injuries were reported from the fire, which burned about 1,000 square feet.

Capt. Greg Pixley, a spokesman for the fire department, said, “This type of plastic that the seats are composed of burns with not only significant ferocity … but also produces a tremendous amount of black smoke.”


Empower Field at Mile High later said in a tweet, “A small fire that occurred in a construction zone near the East Club Lounge at Empower Field at Mile High has been contained by @Denver_Fire.”

“That area of the stadium was quickly evacuated as a precaution and there were no injuries sustained,” the tweet continued.

The Broncos recently made major news by acquiring Russell Wilson from the Seattle Seahawks.

The Daily Wire reported:

It’s one of the biggest trades in NFL history — at least in recent history — and immediately makes the Broncos a contender in a loaded AFC West. According to Schefter, the Broncos will receive Wilson and a fourth-round draft pick, in exchange for two first-round, two second-round, and a fifth-round draft pick, along with quarterback Drew Lock, tight end Noah Fant, and defensive lineman Shelby Harris. 

The trade ends a 10-year run in Seattle for Wilson, a run that resulted in the Seahawks’ first Super Bowl victory. Wilson has appeared in two Super Bowls and went 104-53-1 as the starting quarterback of the Seahawks. Wilson has thrown for 37,059 yards, 292 touchdowns and 87 interceptions in his career.

The Daily Wire,Country Legend Hank Williams Jr. Mourning Loss Of Wife Of More Than Thirty Years,C,"Country legend Hank Williams Jr. is mourning the loss of his wife of more than thirty years,  Mary Jane Thomas, following her death earlier this week.

A member of the country singer’s family confirmed that Thomas died on Tuesday in Jupiter, Florida, following a reported medical procedure, possibly involving a blood clot, reported TMZ.

A spokesperson for Jupiter Police Department said authorities responded to a medical call to the Jupiter Beach Resort & Spa around 5 p.m. on Tuesday, the outlet noted. Thomas was reportedly transported to a local hospital where she was pronounced dead. There have been mixed reports as to her age, from 58 to 61.


Williams and Thomas’ son Sam released a statement following her death, calling her a “beautiful soul” as he shared how much he will miss his “dear mama,” reported People magazine.

“My dear Mama Mary Jane was a beautiful soul who forever affected everyone who knew her,” Sam explained. “She had a smile and presence that lit up every room and she never met a stranger she didn’t befriend. Her spirit was gentle and giving. She could take down a ten-point buck and fix dinner for her grandchildren at the same time! Now she gets to radiate from above with my sister Katherine Diana right by her side.”

“She grew up competing in baton and cheerleading and was one of Hawaiian Tropic’s top models,” he added about his mom. “My father fell in love with the Daytona Beach beauty the minute he set eyes on her in the early ’80s. They went on to live the most powerful love story of travel and hunting and raising a family.”

“She is survived by my father, her two parents Ramona and Bill, her brother Andy, her sister Angela, myself and her three grandchildren: Beau Weston, Tennyson Hiram and Audrey Jane,” the “Family Traditions” hitmaker’s son continued. “Rest in peace Mama, I will always be the son of Mary Jane.”

Williams’ daughter Katherine died in a car crash in 2020, reported previously by the outlet. She was 27.

Hank and Thomas met at one of his concerts in 1985. They would tie the knot five years later in 1990 and were together until her death. Mary Jane was the country rockstar’s third wife, and the couple shared two kids together, son Sam and their late-daughter Katherine.

The Daily Wire,Pro-Life Sidewalk Counselor Testifies At Jackson Hearing,C,"On Thursday, a pro-life counselor testified at the Supreme Court confirmation hearing for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, detailing her role as a sidewalk counselor, sharing profound and moving stories about her work helping pregnant women.

Eleanor McCullen spoke to the committee, and described her efforts to tell women the options they have other than abortion.

She explained, “I have dedicated my life in service to empowering women as a sidewalk counselor. I was also the lead plaintiff in an important free speech case, McCullen Vs. Coakley.”

“So many women I’ve met believe that their only choice is to end the life of their baby. It is in that moment of isolation and fear that I have the privilege of offering a different choice, one that empowers and encourages the woman to know she is fully capable of becoming a mom and pursuing a job, and going to school, and having a successful and happy life,” she said.

“It’s a powerful moment when a woman looks at me and our eyes connect and she stops to talk. It’s in that moment I promise her she will never walk her journey alone,” she added.

She said that she tells them, “I will stand with you throughout the nine months and beyond. I will hold your hand.”

“I’m able to provide the mothers whatever resources they might need in that moment, including medical care, financial support, of course they come to our house, of course baby clothes and bassinets. I’ve had many, many, many, many baby showers,” she added, noting that they have been able to financially help mothers go back to school.

“And I just stick with the mothers and their families for as long as they need my help … and being able to watch the children grow up, children who wouldn’t be here had the mother not stopped to talk to me. This is an incredible privilege,” she said.

She explained how she knows the pain of being unable to serve women when the government attempts to step in and prohibit free speech.

She discussed a 2007 Massachusetts law that created a “buffer zone” around abortion facilities prohibiting pro-life speakers from coming within a certain distance of the facility. McCullen challenged the legislation in a lawsuit. She said the entire reason she challenged the law was because she didn’t want to shout from a distance or appear as if she didn’t have compassion.

She described how Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote an amicus brief as an attorney in support of Massachusetts’ previous buffer zone law enacted in 2000.

In 2014, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the Massachusetts law violated the First Amendment.

McCullen went on to tell a story about a woman who recently called her after finding her card in a baby scrapbook for her daughter, who is now eighteen years old and heading to college. The woman thanked McCullen for being there to talk to her, saying that her daughter is “the joy of our life.”

McCullen pressed Judge Jackson to uphold all Americans’ First Amendment freedoms if confirmed.

As The Daily Wire reported, while she was a lawyer, Jackson wrote an amicus brief in defense of a Massachusetts law that controlled actions within a certain distance of “reproductive health care” centers.

According to the brief:

The Massachusetts Act, however, regulates conduct only within eighteen feet of a “reproductive health care facility.”

Within that narrow zone, the Act makes it unlawful to “knowingly approach” within six feet of another person, without that person’s consent, “for the purpose of passing a leaflet or handbill to, displaying a sign to, or engaging in oral protest, education or counseling with such other person…”

The amicus brief also stated:

Contrary to the district court’s implication, the Act grew out of a sustained legislative effort to balance the free speech rights of abortion protesters against patients’ and providers’ right of access. The Legislature’s solution, developed by a working committee comprised of legislators with differing views on the issue, was a compromise: a statute that permits speakers on all sides of the abortion debate to voice their views about reproductive health services openly and vigorously, so long as, within an eighteen-foot radius of clinic entrances and driveways, such speakers do not approach within six feet of unconsenting individuals. This “floating bubble” legislation has the advantage of protecting the interests of everyone involved in the abortion debate: it allows free and open communication while at the same time enabling patients and staff members to proceed into the clinic unhindered.",https://www.dailywire.com/news/pro-life-sidewalk-counselor-testifies-at-jackson-hearing,2022-03-24
The Daily Wire,NCAA Ignores Outcry From Female Swimmers Over Biological Men In Women’s Sports,C,"The NCAA is apparently ignoring national outcry over the inclusion of a biologically male athlete in the recent NCAA Women’s Swimming Championships, staying silent despite concerns from swimmers, parents, and the public at large.

The Daily Wire has repeatedly reached out to the association regarding testimony from fathers and swimmers who protest against Lia Thomas, a biologically male athlete, swimming in female races.

Despite highly publicized calls for action from Virginia Tech swimmer Reka Gyorgy and University of Kentucky swimmer Riley Gaines — both of whom competed against Thomas and suffered for it, the NCAA has not responded to requests for comment.

Gyorgy placed 17th in the 500 freestyle, meaning that she did not make it back to the finals and was a first alternate. If Thomas, a biological male, had not participated, Gyorgy would have made it to the finals.

“I’m writing this letter right now in hopes that the NCAA will open their eyes and change these rules in the future,” she wrote in a letter to the NCAA that she released Sunday. “It doesn’t promote our sport in a good way and I think it is disrespectful against the biologically female swimmers who are competing in the NCAA.”

Gaines competed in the women’s 200 freestyle and tied for fifth place with Thomas. In an interview with The Daily Wire, she said she was made to hold the sixth-place trophy during award ceremony pictures, while Thomas was given the fifth-place trophy.

The swimmer believes that the NCAA was “trying to save face” in elevating Thomas in this situation, telling The Daily Wire that the experience was “disheartening” and that she “left the pool with no trophy.”

“Who are we trying to protect here?” she questioned, “and who are we trying to fight for here?”

The NCAA Board of Governors updated its transgender participation policy in January, requiring transgender athletes to document “sport-specific” testosterone levels within their sport’s approved range at the beginning of the season and ahead of championship selections.

“We are steadfast in our support of transgender student-athletes and the fostering of fairness across college sports,” John DeGioia, chair of the NCAA board and president of Georgetown University, said in a statement at the time.

“It is important that NCAA member schools, conferences and college athletes compete in an inclusive, fair, safe and respectful environment and can move forward with a clear understanding of the new policy,” he added.

But parents and athletes apparently do not find the move bold enough.

Linnea Saltz, a former NCAA track athlete who raced against a biological man, is not surprised that the NCAA has preserved silence on the matter since she brought her concerns to the association in 2019 with little results.

“Here we are today still dealing with the same issues,” she said.

Saltz told The Daily Wire on Thursday that she hoped that seeing the “overwhelming amount of individuals” affected by the NCAA’s decision would prompt the association to “finally make a decision that protects these women.”


“It is pertinent that the NCAA listen to these concerns as they are the governing body that is supposed to protect these athletes,” the former track athlete added. “This new NCAA narrative of inclusivity is exclusionary to women in sports.”

Saltz insisted: “If the issue is not addressed now, then when? It is clear a decision needs to be made as the situation will continue to worsen and more individuals will become affected if not.”

The NCAA’s silence on the matter perhaps indicates that the organization hopes outcry will die down and concerns over the issue will be forgotten.

But parents told The Daily Wire at the championships in Atlanta that the entire meet was abuzz with concerns and qualms about fairness in women’s sports.

“If the NCAA continues to sideline women and the accomplishments of female athletes, Congress must hold them accountable,” Annabelle Rutledge, national director for Young Women for America, told The Daily Wire. “And as American citizens, we must be relentless in our support of female athletes, calling on the Administration to uphold Title IX, and engaging with our state and federal members to hold the NCAA to account.”",https://www.dailywire.com/news/ncaa-ignores-outcry-from-female-swimmers-over-biological-men-in-womens-sports,2022-03-24
The Daily Wire,Democrats Fume After Supreme Court Sides With Republicans On Voting Map Issue,C,"The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday sided with Wisconsin Republicans challenging “redistricting” efforts from Democrats in the state, throwing out legislative maps drawn by Democratic Governor Tony Evers and adopted by its highest court, The Washington Post reported.

The Supreme Court granted a Republican request to block new maps that “increased the number of state Assembly districts with a majority of Black voters from six to seven,” Reuters reported. “The court sent that case back to the Wisconsin Supreme Court and ordered it to adopt new maps laying out the various districts.”

The Wisconsin Supreme Court “committed legal error in its application of decisions of this Court regarding the relationship between the constitutional guarantee of equal protection and the VRA (Voting Right Act),” the opinion said, adding that the state court “believed that it had to conclude only that the VRA might support race-based districting — not that the statute required it. … Our precedent instructs otherwise.”

“The question that our VRA precedents ask and the court failed to answer is whether a race-neutral alternative that did not add a seventh majority-black district would deny black voters equal political opportunity,” the majority wrote.

The Wisconsin court “is free to take additional evidence if it prefers to reconsider the Governor’s maps rather than choose from among the other submissions. Any new analysis, however, must comply with our equal protection jurisprudence,” it added.

Vox reported that the high court used a process known as “summary reversal” to toss the maps, “meaning that the Court tossed out the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s decision completely without receiving full briefing or hearing oral arguments.”

Liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan dissented from the majority.

“In an emergency posture, the Court summarily overturns a Wisconsin Supreme Court decision resolving a conflict over the State’s redistricting, a decision rendered after a 5-month process involving all interested stakeholders,” Sotomayor wrote, according to The Hill. “Despite the fact that summary reversals are generally reserved for decisions in violation of settled law, the Court today faults the State Supreme Court for its failure to comply with an obligation that, under existing precedent, is hazy at best.”

In a second unsigned ruling, “the court rejected a challenge from five Republican congressmen who objected to the congressional map adopted by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which had also been prepared by Mr. Evers, a Democrat,” The New York Times reported.

Democrats and their allies in the media fumed over the news, claiming it was an attack on “voting rights.”

“Today’s Supreme Court action in Wisconsin is simply wrong and is grounded in an unprecedented process and a failure to adhere to precedent,” former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder posted to social media. “The Court continues to put its legitimacy at risk.”


Left-wing site Slate called the ruling an “astonishing, inexplicable blow to the Voting Rights Act.”

Journalist John Nichols called the decision “stunning” and “wrong.”

“In a stunning decision that confirms just how extreme the US Supreme Court’s majority has become, #SCOTUS has rejected the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling that embraced [Governor Evers] ’ legislative district maps. Justice Sonia Sotomayor calls the ruling ‘unprecedented.’ It’s also wrong,” he wrote.

The Daily Wire,Top U.S. Senator Comes Out Against Biden SCOTUS Nominee: ‘Cannot and Will Not Support Judge Jackson’,C,"U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) announced on Thursday that he will not support President Joe Biden’s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, after coming into the process with “an open mind.”

“After studying the nominee’s record and watching her performance this week, I cannot and will not support Judge Jackson for a lifetime appointment to our highest Court,” McConnell said in a statement. “First, Judge Jackson refuses to reject the fringe position that Democrats should try to pack the Supreme Court. Justices Ginsburg and Breyer had no problem denouncing this unpopular view and defending their institution. I assumed this would be an easy softball for Judge Jackson. But it wasn’t.”

“The nominee suggested there are two legitimate sides to the issue,” he continued. “She testified that she has a view on the matter but would not share it. She inaccurately compared her non-answer to a different, narrower question that a prior nominee was asked. But Judge Jackson seemingly tipped her hand. She said she would be, ‘thrilled to be one of however many.’ The opposite of the Ginsburg and Breyer sentiment. The most radical pro-court-packing fringe groups badly wanted this nominee for this vacancy. Judge Jackson was the court-packers’ pick. And she testified like it.”

McConnell specifically took issue with Jackson’s stances on crime and illegal immigration in his statement.

“This is one area where Judge Jackson’s trial court records provide a wealth of information. And it is troubling,” McConnell said. “The Judge regularly gave certain terrible kinds of criminals light sentences that were beneath the sentencing guidelines and beneath the prosecutors’ requests. The Judge herself, this week, used the phrase ‘policy disagreement’ to describe this subject. The issue isn’t just the sentences. It’s also the Judge’s rhetoric in trial transcript and the creative ways she bent the law. In one instance, Judge Jackson used COVID as a pretext to essentially rewrite a criminal justice reform law from the bench and make it retroactive, which Congress had declined to do.”

“She did so to cut the sentence of a fentanyl trafficker while Americans died in huge numbers from overdoses,” he continued. “Judge Jackson declined to walk Senators through the merits of her reasoning in specific cases. She just kept repeating that it was her discretion, and if Congress didn’t like it, it was our fault for giving her the discretion. That is hardly an explanation as to why she uses her discretion the way she does. It was not reassuring to hear Judge Jackson essentially say that if Senators want her to be tough on crime, we need to change the law, take away her discretion, and force her to do it. That response just seems to confirm that deeply-held personal policy views seep into her jurisprudence. And that is exactly what the record suggests.”",https://www.dailywire.com/news/top-u-s-senator-comes-out-against-biden-scotus-nominee-cannot-and-will-not-support-judge-jackson,2022-03-24
The Daily Wire,"Feminist Group Condemns NCAA For Ignoring Pleas Of Female Swimmers, Shielding Trans Swimmer ‘Who Didn’t Do Particularly Well In Men’s Swimming Competitions’",C,"A feminist organization is condemning the NCAA for staying silent amid a national controversy over the inclusion of a biologically male athlete in the recent NCAA Women’s Swimming Championships.

“We are deeply disappointed by the NCAA’s promotion and celebration of a male athlete over the wellbeing of female athletes during the past few months,” Mahri Irvine, the executive director of the Women’s Liberation Front (WoLF), said in a Thursday afternoon statement to The Daily Wire.

WoLF weighed in following a Daily Wire report exposing the NCAA’s silence as fathers, swimmers, and members of the public protest the inclusion of Lia Thomas, a biologically male athlete, in female races.

The NCAA has not responded to many requests for comment from The Daily Wire, despite highly publicized calls for action from Virginia Tech swimmer Reka Gyorgy and University of Kentucky swimmer Riley Gaines — both of whom competed against Thomas and suffered for it.

“Lia Thomas has been portrayed by the NCAA as a woman who legitimately deserves to compete in women’s sports,” Irvine said. “However, nothing could be further from the truth.”

The WoLF executive director pointed to the fact that Thomas, who won the 500 freestyle last Thursday evening, tied for fifth in the 200 freestyle Friday evening, and placed eighth in the 100 freestyle, formerly raced with men for three years.

“Lia is a man who didn’t do particularly well in men’s swimming competitions,” Irvine said. “This man decided to say that he is a woman in order to gain access to women’s sports.”

WoLF is disappointed not just by the NCAA’s “silent treatment toward female athletes,” Irvine said. The organization is also “gravely concerned that the NCAA has chosen to engage in gaslighting of our entire country.”

“We all know that Lia Thomas is male, and we all know that the NCAA is engaging in psychological manipulation of athletes, coaches, sports fans, and the general public,” the WoLF executive director continued.

“We hope that the NCAA will somehow find the courage to admit that it has made serious errors in judgment related to this issue,” she added. “We hope that someday, the NCAA will actually start supporting female athletes instead of devaluing them and psychologically manipulating them.”

The Daily Wire also reached out to a slew of women’s advocacy groups for this story, including the Women’s March, Ultra Violet, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Emily’s List, the National Women’s Law Center, and the Center for Reproductive Rights.

Ultra Violet declined to weigh in on the matter, while the rest of the organizations remained silent.

Gyorgy placed 17th in the 500 freestyle, meaning that she did not make it back to the finals, and was a first alternate. Had Thomas, a biological male, not participated, Gyorgy would have made it to the finals.

“I’m writing this letter right now in hopes that the NCAA will open their eyes and change these rules in the future,” she wrote in a letter to the NCAA that she released Sunday. “It doesn’t promote our sport in a good way and I think it is disrespectful against the biologically female swimmers who are competing in the NCAA.”

Gaines competed in the women’s 200 freestyle and tied for fifth place with Thomas. In an interview with The Daily Wire, she revealed that she was made to hold the sixth place trophy during award ceremony pictures, while Thomas was given the fifth place trophy.

The swimmer believes that the NCAA was “trying to save face” in elevating Thomas in this situation, telling The Daily Wire that the experience was “disheartening” and that she “left the pool with no trophy.”

“Who are we trying to protect here,” she questioned, “and who are we trying to fight for here?”

The NCAA Board of Governors updated its transgender participation policy in January, requiring transgender athletes to document “sport-specific” testosterone levels within their sport’s approved range at the beginning of the season and ahead of championship selections.",https://www.dailywire.com/news/feminist-group-condemns-ncaa-for-ignoring-pleas-of-female-swimmers-shielding-trans-swimmer-who-didnt-do-particularly-well-in-mens-swimming-competitions,2022-03-24
The Daily Wire,"Trump Sues Hillary Clinton, Dozens Of Others Over ‘Far-Reaching’ Russian Collusion Conspiracy",C,"Former President Donald Trump sued numerous people and entities involved with the Steele Dossier and the 2016 Russian collusion conspiracy on Thursday.

Trump’s suit, filed in the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Florida, accuses former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former FBI Director James Comey, the Democratic National Committee, and dozens of others of engaging in an organized plot to spread malicious and false information about Trump.

“In the run-up to the 2016 Presidential Election, Hillary Clinton and her cohorts orchestrated an unthinkable plot — one that shocks the conscience and is an affront to this nation’s democracy,” Trump’s suit begins. “Acting in concert, the Defendants maliciously conspired to weave a false narrative that their Republican opponent, Donald J. Trump, was colluding with a hostile foreign sovereignty. The actions taken in furtherance of their scheme — falsifying evidence, deceiving law enforcement, and exploiting access to highly-sensitive data sources — are so outrageous, subversive and incendiary that even the events of Watergate pale in comparison.”

“Under the guise of ‘opposition research,’ ‘data analytics,’ and other political stratagems, the Defendants nefariously sought to sway the public’s trust. They worked together with a single, self-serving purpose: to vilify Donald J. Trump,” the suit continues. “Indeed, their far-reaching conspiracy was designed to cripple Trump’s bid for presidency by fabricating a scandal that would be used to trigger an unfounded federal investigation and ignite a media frenzy.”

Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and his subsequent presidency was hounded by allegations that his campaign worked with Moscow to rig the 2016 presidential election. The allegations stemmed from the Steele Dossier, a report put together by former British spy Christopher Steele and funded by Clinton’s campaign.

Former special counsel Robert Mueller found no evidence of the alleged collusion after a roughly two-year investigation into the dossier and Russia’s role in the 2016 election.

Trump’s lawsuit alleges that the defendants violated U.S. RICO laws, or laws used against organized crime groups such as gangs and mafias, among other violations.

“The members of the Enterprise are a group of persons associated together for the common purpose of carrying on an ongoing enterprise; specifically, the Enterprise had a common, unlawful goal of dismantling the Plaintiff’s political career and/or impeding his ability to effectively govern through fraudulent, deceptive, and criminal means, including, but not limited to, falsely implicating the Plaintiff, the Trump Campaign, and the Trump Administration as colluding with Russia,” the lawsuit states, explaining its RICO case.

Combatting the false allegations cost Trump at least $24 million, according to the lawsuit.

“Among other things, the Plaintiff was forced to incur expenses in an amount to be determined at trial, but known to be in excess of twenty-four million dollars ($24,000,000) and continuing to accrue, in the form of defense costs, legal fees, and related expenses incurred in connection with his effort to defend against the Defendants’ actions and the various federal investigations and/or official proceedings which arose therefrom, in addition to the loss of existing and future business opportunities for himself, the Trump Campaign, and the Trump Organization LLC,” the lawsuit says.",https://www.dailywire.com/news/trump-sues-hillary-clinton-dozens-of-others-over-far-reaching-russian-collusion-conspiracy,2022-03-24
The Daily Wire,Cory Booker Makes Himself — And Judge Jackson — Cry With Dramatic Outburst During Hearing,C,"Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) brought himself — and Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson — to tears on Wednesday as he broke into an animated explanation of just how much her nomination meant to him.

Booker used a portion of his time during Jackson’s confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee to wax on about the historic nature of her nomination, excitedly telling her, “I’m not letting anybody in the Senate steal my joy!”

CSPAN
@cspan
""This country is getting better and better...When that final vote happens and you ascend onto the highest Court in the land, I'm going to rejoice. And I'm going to tell you right now, the greatest country in the world, the United States of America, will be better because of you.""

“I’m telling you right now,” Booker began, “I’m not letting anybody in the Senate steal my joy! I told you this at the beginning, I — I’m embarrassed … I just look at you, and I start getting full of emotion.”

The New Jersey Senator went on to tell a story about going for a run, saying that a black woman had approached him — in part, he believed, because of the role he would have in confirming Judge Jackson.

“I put my music on loud when I’m jogging, trying to block out the noise of the heart attack I’m having,” Booker said, prompting laughs. “And this woman comes up on me, practically tackles me, an African American woman. And the look on her eye, she just wanted to touch me, ’cause I think — ’cause I’m sitting so close to you — and tell me what it meant to her to watch you sitting where you’re sitting.”

Booker then touted Judge Jackson’s hard work and dedication, saying that she hadn’t achieved all she had because of a “Left-wing agenda” — and Jackson reached for her tissues.

“You got here how every black woman in America who’s gotten anywhere has done,” Booker continued, his voice cracking at times. “By being — like Ginger Rogers said, ‘I did everything Fred Astaire did, but backwards in heels.’ And so I’m just sitting here saying, ‘Nobody’s stealing my joy, nobody’s going to make me angry.'”

Booker then mentioned how he was treated when he arrived at the Capitol, being only the fourth black Senator in Washington. His voice wavered again when he explained the moment in the Oval Office when he tried to explain to President Joe Biden how much it affected him personally to see the first black woman nominated to the nation’s highest court.

“It’s hard for me not to look at you and not see my mom. Not to see my cousins, one of them who had to come here and sit behind you. She had to have your back. I see my ancestors and yours,” Booker said. “But don’t worry, my sister. Don’t worry. God has got you. And how do I know that? You’re here, and I know what it’s taken for you to sit in that seat.”

“You have earned this spot. You are worthy. You are a great American,” he added, in an apparent jab and critics who panned Biden for making Jackson’s race and gender requirements for her nomination.

“This country is getting better and better,” Booker concluded. “When that final vote happens and you ascend onto the highest Court in the land, I’m going to rejoice. And I’m going to tell you right now, the greatest country in the world, the United States of America, will be better because of you.”",https://www.dailywire.com/news/cory-booker-makes-himself-and-judge-jackson-cry-with-dramatic-outburst-during-hearing,2022-03-24
The Daily Wire,"California State University Drops SATs, ACTs From Admissions Requirements",C,"California State University (CSU) will no longer require students to submit SAT or ACT scores for college admissions, making it the largest four-year college system in the country to drop the requirement.

CBS News reported that CSU’s Board of Trustees voted unanimously on Wednesday to make the change, and that the move follows the University of California’s decision to do the same in 2020. CSU had already suspended the use of test scores during the 2021-22 and 2022-23 academic years due to the coronavirus pandemic, but this week made the move permanent.

“This decision aligns with the California State University’s continued efforts to level the playing field and provide greater access to a high-quality college degree for students from all backgrounds,” CSU acting Chancellor Steve Relyea said in a statement, according to CBS. “In essence, we are eliminating our reliance on the high-stress, high-stakes test that has shown negligible benefit and providing our applicants with greater opportunities to demonstrate their drive, talents and potential for college success.”

Students can still use the test scores to get placed into the right math and English courses, but they will no longer need them specifically for admission into the university system. Instead, CSU said it would “utilize a multi-factored admission criteria to determine student eligibility in lieu of standardized test scores.”

The Daily Wire previously reported in June 2020 that the UC system voted to stop requiring SAT and ACT scores because, as some members claimed, the test was harmful to minorities. The Daily Wire reported:

Yet only a few weeks earlier, the entire faculty senate voted to retain the SAT as a result of a study commissioned by UC system president Janet Napolitano that found that the SAT and the ACT increased minority enrollment across the UC system.

“The 228-page report, loaded with hundreds of displays of data from the UC’s various admissions departments, found that the SAT and a commonly used alternative test, ACT —  also eliminated – actually helped increase black, Hispanic, and Native American enrollment at the system’s 10 campuses. The report recommended that their use be continued,” Richard Bernstein of RealClearInvestigations reported.

The report stated, “The Task Force found that of the 22,613 students guaranteed admission through the statewide index (the admissions pathway in which test scores can compensate for lower HSGPA) but not through Eligibility in the Local Context (ELC), which only considers high school grades, about 25% were members of underrepresented minority groups, and 47% were low-income or first generation students. These students would not have been guaranteed admission on the basis of their grades alone.”

Yet the testing requirement was still removed.

Earlier this year, The Daily Wire reported that the SAT was going to be shortened and taken entirely online.

“Beginning in 2024 for U.S. students, the test will be shortened to two hours instead of the current grueling three hours, and it will allow more time per question. The new SAT will also feature shorter reading passages with one question per passage, and students will be allowed to use a calculator for the math section,” The Daily Wire reported. “The new SAT will also be online, although it will still be administered in-person at schools and test centers. However, students will be able to choose whether they want to use their personal tablet or laptop or a school device. In addition, the new test will speed up the turnaround time for students to get their scores from weeks to days.”",https://www.dailywire.com/news/california-state-university-drops-sats-acts-from-admissions-requirements,2022-03-24
The Guardian,Violence in Mexico and Central America driving large waves of migration,C,"Waves of migration through Mexico and Central America, and people who go missing, will increase in 2022 due to high levels of violence in the region, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said.

“In many countries, violence is wreaking more and more havoc, and that’s why there are more and more migrants,” ICRC representative Jordi Raich told Reuters in an interview Wednesday. “And it’s not a situation that is going to improve or slow down, not even in the years to come.“

Immigration authorities in Mexico detained 307,679 migrants in 2021, a 68% increase compared with 182,940 detentions in 2019, according to government data.

Shelters in Mexico were completely overwhelmed last year, filled with frustrated migrants unable to continue their journey to the United States, Raich said.

Many migrants get “stuck” along Mexico’s southern or northern borders, Raich said, where they face “enormous economic constraints” and are able to find only basic services.

The administration of Joe Biden has faced record numbers of migrants arriving at the southern border and has implored Mexico and Central American countries to do more to stem the wave.

Disappearances in the region have not slowed either, the Red Cross said in a report released Thursday. Mexico recently surpassed 100,000 people reported missing in the country.

In El Salvador, 488 missing person cases remain unsolved, and in Guatemala, the number of missing women rose to six a day, the Red Cross report said.

Raich said it will be difficult to respond to the root causes of migration immediately. A joint effort among countries like El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras is necessary, he added.

“Migration is not going to stop,” Raich said. “If you try to prevent it or strictly regulate it, people start to pile up at the borders, which is happening in Mexico and other countries.”

Meanwhile, the Biden administration on Thursday rolled out a sweeping new regulation that aims to speed up asylum processing and deportations at the US-Mexico border, amid a record number of migrants seeking to enter the US.

The announcement of the new rule came as US officials are debating whether to end a separate Covid-era policy that has blocked most asylum claims at the border. The asylum overhaul could provide a faster way to process border crossers if the Covid order is ended.

The final asylum rule, which will go into effect in late May, will authorize asylum officers to accept or reject migrants’ claims for protection soon after they cross the border, in an effort to resolve them in months rather than years by bypassing backlogged US immigration courts.

The administration of Democratic president Joe Biden says it is a humane way to deal with the rising number of attempted border crossings, which have hit records and triggered attacks from Republicans aiming to take control of Congress in the November midterm elections.

The new policy faced criticism from groups that favor more immigration restrictions as well as from some pro-immigrant advocacy organizations, and may be challenged in court.

Most migrants apprehended at the US south-west border come from Mexico and Central America, but an increasing number are arriving from farther places and seeking refuge, including in recent weeks Ukrainians fleeing Russia’s invasion of their country.

Under the new rule, which is being issued jointly by the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice, more migrants, including families, will be placed in a process known as “expedited removal” to resolve cases more quickly. It will not apply to unaccompanied children.

“The current system for handling asylum claims at our borders has long needed repair,” homeland security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement.

Some immigrant rights advocates oppose the fast-track process, which aims to process cases within 90 days, fearing it will lead to more deportations.

The new rule “risks sacrificing accurate decision-making for its narrative of speed”, said Eleanor Acer, senior director for refugee protection at Human Rights First.

While migrants denied asylum will get another chance to make their case before an immigration judge, those cases will also be expedited with a goal of resolving them within 90 days.

Biden has kept a controversial order known as Title 42, allowing authorities to quickly expel most migrants caught crossing the border to Mexico or other countries to limit the spread of Covid-19.

The administration is leaning toward ending the order after court decisions that complicate its implementation, and is faced with a deadline next week to renew, modify or terminate it.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/24/migration-violence-mexico-central-america,2022-03-24
The Guardian,US charges four Russian hackers over cyber-attacks on global energy sector,C,"The US has unveiled criminal charges against four Russian government officials, saying they engaged in two major hacking campaigns between 2012 and 2018 that targeted the global energy sector and affected thousands of computers across 135 countries.

In one now-unsealed indictment from August 2021, the justice department said three alleged hackers from Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) carried out cyber-attacks on the computer networks of oil and gas firms, nuclear power plants, and utility and power transmission companies across the world between 2012 and 2017.

The three accused Russians in that case are Pavel Aleksandrovich Akulov, 36, Mikhail Mikhailovich Gavrilov, 42, and Marat Valeryevich Tyukov, 39.

In a second unsealed indictment from June 2021, the DoJ accused Evgeny Viktorovich Gladkikh, a 36-year-old Russian ministry of defense research institute employee, of conspiring with others between May and September 2017 to hack the systems of a foreign refinery and install malware known as “Triton” on a safety system produced by Schneider Electric.

The justice department unsealed the two cases just days after US president Joe Biden warned about “evolving intelligence” suggesting the Russian government is exploring options for more cyber-attacks in the future.

A department official told reporters on Thursday that even though the hacking at issue in the two cases occurred years ago, investigators remained concerned Russia will continue to launch similar attacks.

These charges show the dark art of the possible when it comes to critical infrastructure,” the official said.

The official added that the four accused Russians are not in custody, but the department decided to unseal the indictments because they determined the “benefit of revealing the results of the investigation now outweighs the likelihood of arrests in the future.”

The 2017 attack stunned the cybersecurity community when it was made public by researchers later that year because – unlike typical digital intrusions aimed at stealing data or holding it for ransom – it appeared aimed at causing physical damage to the facility itself by disabling its safety system.

US officials have been tracking the case and its aftershocks ever since.

In 2019, those behind Triton were reported to be scanning and probing at least 20 electric utilities in the United States for vulnerabilities.

The following year – two weeks before the 2020 US presidential election – the US treasury department sanctioned the Russian government-backed Central Scientific Research Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics, where Gladkikh is alleged to have worked.

The news of the indictment represents “a shot across the bow” to any Russian hacking groups that might be poised to carry out destructive attacks against US critical infrastructure, said John Hultquist of the cybersecurity firm Mandiant.

Now that these criminal charges are public, he added, the United States has “let them know that we know who they are.”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/24/us-charges-russian-hackers-cyber-attacks,2022-03-24
The Guardian,Texas attorney general says school district’s Pride week ‘breaks state law’,C,"The attorney general of Texas has declared a school district’s celebration of LGBTQ+ students “sex education” and in violation of Texas law.

For the past eight years, students in the Austin Independent school district have held a district-wide Pride week as a chance to celebrate LGBTQ+ students, staff and families in the district, according to the district’s website.

But on Tuesday, the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, sent a letter to the school district calling Pride week “sex education” and notifying the school that without parental consent, the celebration is “breaking state law”.

“The Texas legislature has made it clear that when it comes to sex education, parents – not school districts – are in charge,” said Paxton in his letter shared to Twitter.

“By hosting ‘Pride week’, your district has, at best, undertaken a week-long instructional effort in human sexuality without parental consent,” continued Paxton. “Or, worse, your district is cynically pushing a week-long indoctrination of your students that not only fails to obtain parental consent, but subtly cuts parents out of the loop. Either way, you are breaking state law.”

The school district’s superintendent, Dr Stephanie S Elizalde, responded to the attorney general’s comments about 45 minutes after Paxton posted his letter.

“I want all our LGBTQIA+ students to know that we are proud of them and that we will protect them against political attacks,” said Elizalde on Twitter.

District spokesperson Jason Stanford spoke with the Washington Post and shared a similar message: “We’re going to react to this by doubling down on making sure our kids feel safe and celebrating Pride.”

Stanford also noted that Paxton’s letter was politically motivated as Paxton faces a primary runoff with another Republican in May and is being investigated by the FBI for bribery and abuse of office.

“This is not a parental rights issue,” said Stanford to the Post. “This is a Ken Paxton trying to score political points issue.”

In recent weeks, Paxton has targeted LGBTQ+ youth in Texas. In addition to the letter, last month, Paxton wrote an opinion stating that gender-affirming care for children was “child abuse” under Texas law, prompting the Republican governor, Greg Abbott, to instruct the state’s child protection services to investigate parents providing their children with that care.

When a judge temporarily blocked Abbott’s order, Paxton asked the state supreme court to overturn the ban.

After the Pride week’s agenda was shared online, some administrators in the Austin Independent school district had their personal information posted online and have received death threats, reported KUT, a local news affiliate.

Students were forced to have pride celebrations inside as police were stationed outside.

“The kids had no idea what was going on, but the teachers were afraid to go to work,” said Stanford. “So the last thing we’re worried about is what Ken Paxton has to say.”",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/24/texas-attorney-general-pride-week-breaking-state-law,2022-03-24
The Guardian,‘Japan’s most famous yachtsman’: 83-year-old attempts solo Pacific crossing,C,"An 83-year old man is set to sail from San Francisco on Saturday and voyage alone across the Pacific Ocean to his home country, Japan.

Kenichi Horie, also known as “Japan’s most famous yachtsman”, became the first person to make a non-stop solo crossing of the Pacific in 1962. On that trip, he was still a 23-year old amateur seaman. Horie set off from Osaka and sailed across the ocean for 94 days, surviving on canned food and rice before arriving in San Francisco.

The voyage has been widely regarded as a “one-man olive branch of post-war diplomacy” between Pacific powers, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.

“Even in the states, yachtsmen are inspired by his story,” said Morgan Smith, manager of Interpretation, Education and Volunteers at San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park.

Upon arriving in San Francisco, Horie was briefly arrested as he had traveled without a passport or money and little knowledge of English. However, then Mayor George Christopher soon released him and gave him a visa in honor of his bravery.

In the 60 years since then, Horie has made multiple Pacific crossings. The boat Horie used in 1962 has been on display at San Francisco’s Maritime Museum. Named “Mermaid,” the boat lives in the museum’s foyer and is the “superstar” attraction, John Muir, the museum’s small craft curator, told the San Francisco Chronicle.

Horie has voyaged across the Pacific on a variety of vessels, including ones made from aluminum cans and powered by solar panels and another propelled by foot pedals. In 1999, he sailed from the west coast to Japan on a catamaran made out of beer kegs. Three years later, he sailed the other way around via whiskey barrels.

The Guardian,California may give residents $400 rebate to offset record fuel prices,C,"California residents could get free public transit rides and gas rebates under a proposal from the governor to help bring relief as fuel prices in the state reach record highs.

Gavin Newsom’s plan is the latest floated by officials in California, where drivers are paying more for fuel than anywhere else in the country.

US gas prices have started to slowly fall after reaching record levels in recent weeks, surging in part because of pandemic-induced inflation and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But prices in the Golden state have continued to trend upward, and California drivers are now paying an average of $5.88 a gallon, according to AAA.

Here’s what we know about the governor’s proposal:

What is Newsom’s plan?
The Democratic governor has proposed giving all drivers in the state $400 debit cards for up to two vehicles, amounting to a total of $800. Anyone who has a car registered in California would receive the money, regardless of income, immigration status or whether or not their vehicles use gasoline.

Newsom wants to give $750m to transit and rail agencies to cover bus or train fare for Californians who do not own cars. That funding would would cover the costs for free rides for 3 million people a day for three months, the governor said.

The plan also includes $1.1bn to pause scheduled inflationary increases for diesel and fuel taxes this summer, and $500m for projects that promote biking and walking.

Why is Newsom doing this?
California’s gas prices are consistently the highest in the nation. On Wednesday, the state’s average gas prices hit a new record at $5.88 a gallon, more than $2 higher than it was a year ago, according to AAA.

The high fuel costs are hitting residents hard, particularly gig workers for whom fuel makes up a large part of their daily costs.

Giving money directly to taxpayers would provide relief and allow Newsom to avoid suspending the state’s gas tax as other states have done. California’s gas tax is the second-highest in the US at 51 cents a gallon, but Democratic leaders have been wary of pausing it as they fear oil companies would not pass the savings along to drivers.

What are the criticisms?
Republican lawmakers in the state have urged Newsom to suspend California’s gas tax in order to provide immediate relief to drivers. Newsom’s proposal will take time to deliver – the governor’s office has said people could see rebates by July.

“People need relief now,” said James Gallagher, the assembly Republican leader. “We’ve got now, like, four different competing plans amongst the Democrats. These guys are going to negotiate against themselves for weeks to months and who knows what we’re going to get.”

Meanwhile, Democrats have concerns about providing assistance to all Californians with registered vehicles, regardless of their income. Democratic leaders have been discussing their own proposal, which would give $200 rebates to every taxpayer and their children with taxable income less than $125,000 for single filers and $250,000 for joint filers.

Rising fuel prices pose a policy challenge for Newsom as he tries to wean the state off fossil fuels. He has signed executive orders aimed at banning the sale of new gas-powered cars in the state by 2035 and halting all oil extraction by 2045.

Laura Deehan with Environment California, a nonprofit that advocates for an end to fossil fuel use, was critical of Newsom’s effort, and said that giving people money for gas would encourage them to drive more. Instead, the governor should use the $9bn on programs aimed at getting people out of gas-guzzling cars, she said.

“Just giving out these rebates to anyone who has a car in the state isn’t going to help us in the long run move away from the volatility that comes with our dependence on fossil fuels,” she said.

What happens next?
The state legislature, where Democrats dominate both the assembly and the senate, must approve the plan. Newsom’s office said the governor would be willing to negotiate with lawmakers about who can get the money, a process that could take time to sort out.

A moderate Democrat who supported a separately proposed plan to give every taxpayer $400 has indicated they would back Newsom’s effort and urged the legislature and governor to act quickly.

“The contours of the governor’s proposal are a little different than what we proposed, but I would be very happy to support this,” said Cottie Petrie-Norris, a Democratic assembly member from Laguna Beach.

What’s happening elsewhere in the US?
With prices for fuel and other essentials soaring across the US, states are considering giving rebate checks directly to taxpayers as well as cutting sales taxes, offering property tax relief and reducing or suspending state gas taxes.

The proposals come as many states have more funding than usual thanks to billions of dollars in federal pandemic aid and ballooning tax revenue.

Janet Mills, Maine’s governor, wants to send $850 to most residents in the state to help with fuel costs and inflation. New Mexico’s governor recently signed off on a tax package that will give some taxpayers $250 checks, which lawmakers say will help with high gas prices.

Maryland’s governor has signed a law temporarily suspending the state’s gas tax; Georgia has done the same while also offering $1.1bn in refunds to taxpayers. In Illinois, the governor has proposed halting a 2.2-cent increase in the motor fuel tax, suspending a 1% grocery sales tax for a year and providing a property tax rebate of up to $300.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/24/california-gas-prices-rebate-public-transit,2022-03-25
The Guardian,Canada bars its soldiers from joining Ukraine’s foreign legion,C,"Canada has barred its soldiers from joining Ukraine’s “international brigade” of foreign fighters, amid growing concern that captured troops could be used as a Russian propaganda tool.

Speaking to Canadian parliament’s defence committee on Wednesday, Lt Gen Frances Allen, the vice-chief of the defence staff, said top brass had issued an order preventing full-time service members and part-time reservists from travelling to join Ukraine’s newly formed foreign legion.

The rule, which also applies to soldiers on leave, follows a call last month from the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, for volunteers to defend his country from Russia’s invasion.

Thousands are believed to have answered, including enough Canadians to form their own battalion – the Canadian Ukrainian Brigade. While some veterans have used their skills for humanitarian work, others have picked up arms.

The only Canadian soldiers permitted to enter Ukraine are those with formal approval from Wayne Eyre, the chief of defence staff, said Allen. Canada had previously sent 250 military trainers to Ukraine, but those troops were moved to Poland before Russia invaded.

Canadian officials have long been clear that they discourage travel to the region, but the foreign minister, Mélanie Joly, had previously said she was sympathetic to the Ukrainian Canadians wishing to defend the country. Canada has the largest Ukrainian diaspora outside Russia.

“We understand that people of Ukrainian descent want to support their fellow Ukrainians and also that there is a desire to defend the motherland and in that sense it is their own individual decision,” Joly said in early March. “Let me be clear: we are all very supportive of any form of support to Ukrainians right now.”

Much of that aid has been humanitarian, as well as shipments of weapons. Canada has also offered to accept an “unlimited” number of Ukrainians seeking temporary refuge.

The warnings from Allen come as Russia has threatened criminal prosecutions against foreigners captured fighting in Ukraine. Allen also told lawmakers that captured Canadians could become a propaganda tool for Moscow as the Kremlin looks to wage its own information war amid heavy losses on the battlefield.

“Foreigners who may be engaged in the country can be used in ways that are difficult and counterproductive to the work that is going on there through the disinformation campaigns that we know that Russia is very apt to use,” she said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/24/canada-bars-soldiers-joining-ukraine-foreign-legion,2022-03-24
The Guardian,Biden warns Russia Nato will respond if Kremlin uses chemical weapons,C,"Joe Biden raised the stakes with Russia over its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine by warning that Nato would be forced to respond if the Kremlin resorted to using chemical weapons.

Speaking in the aftermath of emergency Nato and G7 summits in Brussels, the US president said that any retaliation would be proportional, though he would not confirm that he would insist on military action.

“We would respond,” Biden said, in response to a question about what Nato would do. “We would respond if he uses it. The nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use.”

The US wanted to see Russia thrown out of the G20 club of leading economic nations, although Biden complained that wasn’t immediately possible because “Indonesia and others do not agree”.

Biden and other western leaders have become fearful that a struggling Russia may try to end Ukraine’s stubborn resistance in the war that has already lasted a month and claimed thousands of lives, with a chemical – or biological or nuclear – attack.

This week it emerged that the White House had set up a special “Tiger Team” to work out how the US would respond if such an attack should take place. But on Thursday, Biden also said: “It would trigger a response in kind” – meaning it would reflect what had taken place.

Concern about a possible Russian chemical or biological attack dominated the Nato summit on Thursday. Speaking a few minutes before Biden, UK prime minister Boris Johnson warned of disastrous consequences for Russia should Putin use chemical weapons in Ukraine.

“You have to have a bit of ambiguity about your response, but I think it would be catastrophic for him if he were to do that – and I think that he understands that,” Johnson told a press conference.

All 30 Nato leaders warned Russia against using chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, arguing in a final summit statement that any such use “would be unacceptable and result in severe consequences”. However, again they did not spell out what the response would be.

One western official said on Thursday they thought it would be “highly unlikely” that there would be a direct military response even if Russia used chemical weapons in Ukraine, although any final decision would be driven by the US.

That would risk a severe escalation of the conflict, the official said. “We are remaining deliberately ambiguous. We don’t want to say exactly how we will respond because Putin will then price that in to his calculations. We want him to remain uncertain … but we are clear there will be severe consequences,” they added.

Masks, protective suits, detection and other equipment would also be supplied by Nato members to Ukraine, Nato’s secretary general Jens Stoltenberg confirmed, reflecting western fears that Russia is trying to create “some kind of pretext”.

The alarm grew after Russia began to spread unproven claims this month that Ukraine had been developing a biological weapons programme with the help of the US. This week Biden said such claims were a “clear sign” that Putin was contemplating a biological or chemical assault.

The development, production and stockpiling and use of chemical weapons is banned by an international treaty signed by 193 countries, including Russia and the US.

Chemical weapons were used on at least 17 occasions during Syria’s civil war, according to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which has accused the Russian-backed regime of Bashar al-Assad of being behind several high-profile attacks.

Nato leaders are also willing to send more powerful weapons to Ukraine after a plea at the Brussels summit from the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, for tanks, rockets and air-defence systems.

On Thursday, during a three-hour meeting, the 30 heads of government discussed how they could upgrade and increase their weapons supply – but without provoking Russia to the point where the conflict would lead to a wider war in Europe.

Stoltenberg said: “I will not go into the details of the exact type of systems we are deploying … What I can say is that allies do what they can to support Ukraine with weapons.”

At the summit, Biden, Johnson and other Nato leaders heard a characteristically passionate call from Zelenskiy for “military assistance – without restrictions”. He asked Nato members to supply more weapons because “Russia uses without restrictions its entire arsenal against us”.

Zelenskiy specifically asked for anti-missile systems, MLRS rocket artillery, anti-ship weapons, air defence equipment – plus tanks and fighter jets. “You can give us 1% of all your planes, 1% of your tanks,” he said.

Nato leaders discussed what further weapons could be supplied, given that Ukraine had held out for far longer than expected, and which countries were best placed to supply what arms, western officials said.

“There was a discussion both about more [military equipment] in terms of more numbers, and more in terms of different equipment,” one official said.

But there are limits; officials indicated they thought it unlikely any Nato country would want to provide tanks, for fear of Russian retaliation. A previous proposal by Poland to transfer 28 MiG-29 jets via the US was rejected by the White House, for similar reasons.

“We have a responsibility to prevent this conflict from becoming a full-fledged war in Europe, involving not only Ukraine and Russia, but Nato allies and Russia,” Stoltenberg said in a post-summit press conference.

Nato members have largely said they will only provide “defensive equipment”, but Russian military errors and Ukraine’s determination to fight back have left the aggressors struggling to make progress without resorting to heavy bombardment that has left the cities of Mariupol and Kharkiv in ruins.

Johnson said the UK would double the number of British missiles sent to Ukraine with an additional 6,000 He also pledged an extra £25m to Ukraine’s military to help it better fight Russia.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/24/nato-leaders-agree-upgrade-weapons-supply-ukraine-russia,2022-03-24
Global News,"NATO activates chemical, nuclear defence elements amid Russia’s war on Ukraine",C,"NATO has activated its “chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defence elements” amid fears Russia could launch a biological strike in Ukraine.

Following an emergency summit of the military alliance on Thursday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters in Brussels the decision comes as the allies move to equip Ukraine with its own biological defences.

“Our top military commander … has activated NATO’s chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defence elements,” he said.

“And allies are deploying additional chemical and biological and nuclear defences to reinforce our existing and new battlegroups, so we are taking measures both to support Ukraine and also to defend ourselves.”

Why is this happening?
Stoltenberg made the announcement as part of a slew of new measures taken by the military alliance to boost its presence in eastern Europe amid a growing Russian threat, he said.

NATO is sending four new battlegroups to Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia, Stoltenberg announced, while promising the allies will further support Ukraine in its fight against Russia as the invasion hit the one-month mark Thursday.

However, the West fears Russia, which has yet to make significant ground in Ukraine, could escalate the conflict by using biological weapons. Leaders have expressed their fears over such an attack, but have not provided evidence one is looming.

Their worries stem from Russian misinformation that the United States is assisting Ukraine in creating biological weapons. American officials have blasted Moscow for spreading an unproven claim as a possible prelude to potentially launching its own biological or chemical attacks on Ukraine.

That fear was enough for NATO to up its assistance to Ukraine, Stoltenberg said.

“Allies agreed to supply equipment to help Ukraine protect against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats,” he said.

“This could include detection equipment, protection and medical support, as well as training for decontamination and crisis management.”

What does this mean for NATO allies?
If a chemical strike were to happen in Ukraine, the effects of it could spill into other parts of Europe, Stoltenberg said. That means NATO allies have to be prepared for worst-case scenarios.

“Any use of chemical weapons will totally change the nature of the conflict, it will be blatant violation of international law and it will have widespread consequences,” Stoltenberg said.

“It will affect the people in Ukraine, but there is also a risk that it will have a direct effect on people living in NATO countries because we can see contamination, we can see the spread of chemical agents or biological weapons into our countries.”

He did not provide any evidence a biological weapons’ attack was looming, nor did he elaborate on what kind of defences NATO allies would be activating to protect themselves. NATO leaders said in a statement they will “take further decisions when we meet in Madrid” in June.

Earlier in the week, a senior U.S. defence official told Reuters that America has not yet seen any concrete proof of an imminent Russian chemical or biological weapons attack, but is closely monitoring intelligence for them.

President Joe Biden said on Monday, without providing evidence, that Russia’s false accusations that Kyiv has biological and chemical weapons showed Russian President Vladimir Putin was considering using them.

The U.S. official, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, shared Biden’s assessment but said “there’s no indication that there’s something imminent in that regard right now.”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday called on Canada and its NATO allies to increase military support for Ukraine as it defends against the invading Russian army.

In a pre-recorded video address to NATO’s emergency summit, which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau attended, Zelenskyy warned that Russia poses a threat to NATO nations in eastern Europe.

Russia “wants to go further. Against eastern members of NATO. The Baltic states. Poland for sure,” Zelenskyy said.

“But NATO has yet to show what the alliance can do to save people.”

Russia’s war on Ukraine has stalled on most fronts. Russia has failed to capture a single major Ukrainian city, seize the capital Kyiv or swiftly topple Zelenskyy’s government.

Russia calls the war, which is the biggest attack on a European state since the Second World War, a “special military operation” to disarm Ukraine and protect it from “Nazis.”

The West describes it as a false pretext for an unprovoked war of aggression to subdue a country Putin describes as illegitimate.

Global News,Committee examining Liberals’ emergency powers debates scope of inquiry,C,"The Parliamentary committee tasked with reviewing the emergency powers used to address last month’s convoy protests is divided on the scope of their study.

The Special Joint Committee on the Declaration of Emergency is scheduled to hold its second meeting Thursday evening, and sources with knowledge of the deliberations tell Global News the biggest sticking point is how much to include in the committee’s review.

One perspective would like to see the committee narrowly focused on the government’s unprecedented invocation of the Emergencies Act to address the protests, with an eye to determining if the Liberals appropriately used those exceptional powers.

The other side wants a more expansive study which would include the roots of the convoy protests that ground downtown Ottawa to a halt and blockaded border crossings in February, law enforcement’s handling — or mishandling — of the protests, and the federal government’s response.

“I think committees normally will work through those issues,” said Sen. Gwen Boniface, one of the three joint chairs of the joint Senate-House of Commons committee.

Boniface said this committee will be unique. It includes both senators and MPs, and is tasked with reviewing an unprecedented situation. But “it’ll be up to the committee to work through the issues and answer the questions,” Boniface said.

There are a number of other parliamentary committees examining the events surrounding the Liberals’ Feb. 14 decision to invoke the Emergencies Act, a never-before-used law that granted police exceptional powers to deal with the dug-in protest that surrounded Parliament Hill for three weeks.

Speaking to the Commons’ public safety committee Thursday, the Ottawa Police Service’s interim chief, Steve Bell, told MPs that the emergency powers played a central role in dislodging the convoy camp.

“From a policing perspective, the legislation provided the OPS the ability to prevent people from participating in this unlawful protest, restrict people from travelling to any area where the unlawful protest was taking place, secure protected places and critical infrastructure … go after the money funding the protest and require third parties to assist us in removing the heavy vehicles that were clogging our streets and creating a safety hazard,” Bell told MPs.

“It was a critical piece in our efforts, but it was only one piece.”

On top of those federal studies, the government must launch a judicial inquiry into the circumstances leading up to the emergency declaration within the next 30 days.

Bonfiace said it’s important to ensure “value for money” in the various concurrent reviews — in other words, making sure the multiple reviews do not repeatedly cover the same ground.

The Emergencies Act also sets out in law what the joint committee is supposed to concern itself with — specifically, the “exercise of powers and the performance of duties and functions pursuant to a declaration of emergency.”

But even those in favour of a limited study by the joint Senate-House of Commons committee agree that it’d be hard to determine if the federal government acted appropriately without some consideration of the convoy context.

“It really is about making sure that what (the committee does) is valuable to the process and that you get the answers that you need,” Boniface said.

“It is more convoluted because of the … perhaps overlapping mandates (of different committees). But I think it can be worked out through the committee with its work and with some goodwill at the table.”",https://globalnews.ca/news/8707822/committee-emergency-powers-debates-scope-of-inquiry/,2022-03-25
Global News,"NATO allies agree to send more resources to Ukraine, will not enforce no-fly zone",C,"Canada and its NATO allies are standing pat on sending troops into Ukraine, despite multiple requests from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for increased military support against an invading Russian army.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg reiterated previous statements following the NATO summit on Thursday that the organization is not interested in sending troops into Ukraine to fight Russia.

He said that they will continue to provide support through weapons, funding and intelligence, but are stopping short of peacekeeping.

“We have a responsibility to ensure that this conflict does not become a full-fledged war between NATO and Russia,” said Stoltenberg. Allies have made it clear that we will not deploy troops on the ground in Ukraine because the only way to do that is to be prepared to engage in full conflict with Russian troops.”

Stoltenberg added that NATO would be increasing its presence in the air and in the seas while also ensuring that cybersecurity was being reinforced to fend off Russian ransomware attacks.

He said that NATO allies had agreed to provide Ukraine with greater support in the event of a chemical, biological or nuclear attack and had activated their own defences.

“Our top military commander has activated NATO’s chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defence elements. And our allies are deploying additional chemical and biological and nuclear defences to reinforce our existing and new backing groups. So we are taking measures both to support Ukraine and also to defend ourselves.”

NATO leaders agreed to provide further support to Ukraine and increase sanctions on Russia and increase defence spending, according to Stoltenberg. The organization also approved four new battlegroups in east Europe.

On Wednesday, in a news conference in Brussels, Stoltenberg told reporters that he expects the leaders to sign off on the deployment of four new battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia.

“I expect leaders will agree to strengthen NATO’s posture in all domains, with major increases in the eastern part of the alliance on land, in the air and at sea,” he said.

The new multinational battlegroups come on top of four existing combat units with roughly 5,000 troops operating in the three Baltic states and Poland. They were deployed after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014.

For countries supporting Russia like Belarus and potentially China, Stoltenberg said that they need to stop providing aid and instead call for “an immediate, peaceful resolution.”

The group is expected to meet again in June, where Stoltenberg said he anticipates countries will provide plans on their updated defence spending and re-evaluate their goals for the organization.

Zelensky sends strong message to NATO
In a pre-recorded video address to a NATO emergency summit, which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau attended, Zelenskyy warned Russia poses a threat to NATO nations in eastern Europe.

Russia “wants to go further. Against eastern members of NATO. The Baltic states. Poland for sure,” Zelenskyy said.

“But NATO has yet to show what the alliance can do to save people.”

Zelenskyy added Ukraine wants NATO to supply it with tanks, planes and anti-ship weapons.

“You can give us one per cent of all your aircraft. One per cent of all your tanks. One per cent!” he said.

“We can’t just buy it. Such a supply directly depends only on NATO’s decisions, on political decisions, by the way.”

Earlier in an video address to Ukraine, Zelenskyy said that Thursday will prove to be a day in which the country’s true allies emerge.

“At these three summits we will see who is our friend, who is our partner and who sold us out and betrayed us,” Zelenskyy said. The G7 and European Union are also meeting on Thursday.

NATO unity important to help Ukraine
Before the summit began, Trudeau said NATO is more than a geographical alliance, but a “group of countries who stand together because we believe in democracy, in the rule of law, in the defence of human rights and the values that underpin all of our societies.”

He added that the “illegal, brutal” invasion by Russia is unacceptable and NATO is “united” in the alliance’s support for Ukraine and condemnation of the continued attacks on the eastern European country.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine one month ago on Feb. 24 has left Europe facing its biggest security threat since the Second World War, and according to Trudeau on Wednesday, a larger threat to the globe.

Ahead of the summit, Stoltenberg spoke to the media, calling the ongoing invasion of Ukraine by Russia the “most serious security crisis in a generation.” He added that this summit was a need for a “reset” in NATO’s operations.

“We need to do more and therefore we need to invest more and there is a new sense of urgency,” he said.

Regarding goals for the summit, Stoltenberg said NATO allies need to show unity and “address this security crisis together.”

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday accused Russia of crossing a red line into barbarism in its war with Ukraine and said the West needed to “tighten the vice” in sanctions to bring the conflict to an end.

“Vladimir Putin has already crossed the red line into barbarism,” Johnson told reporters on arrival in Brussels.

He said more sanctions need to be imposed.

“It is very important we work together to get this thing done. The harder our sanctions … the more we can do to help Ukraine … the faster this thing can be over.”

Trudeau toured Europe two weeks ago, where he held meetings in London, Berlin, Warsaw and Poland, and visited Canadian troops leading a NATO multinational battlegroup in Latvia.

Canada’s defence budget according to NATO estimates stood at 1.39 per cent of the country’s gross domestic product in 2021.

Russia’s war on Ukraine has stalled on most fronts. Russia has failed to capture a single major Ukrainian city, seize the capital Kyiv, or swiftly topple Zelenskyy’s government.

Global News,"Russian missiles in Ukraine have failure rate up to 60%, U.S. officials say",C,"The United States assesses that Russia is suffering failure rates as high as 60 per cent for some of the precision-guided missiles it is using to attack Ukraine, three U.S. officials with knowledge of the intelligence told Reuters.

The disclosure could help explain why Russia has failed to achieve what most could consider basic objectives since its invasion a month ago, such as neutralizing Ukraine’s air force, despite the apparent strength of its military against Ukraine’s much smaller armed forces.

The U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the information, did not provide evidence to support the assessment and did not disclose what precisely was driving high Russian missile failure rates.

Reuters was unable to independently verify the figures.

The Kremlin and Russia’s defense ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Such a high failure rate can include anything from launch failures to a missile failing to explode on impact.

U.S. defense officials told reporters this week that the Pentagon assesses that Russia has launched more than 1,100 missiles of all kinds since the war began. The U.S. officials have so far not said how many of those hit their targets and how many failed to do so.

Citing U.S. intelligence, three U.S. officials said the United States estimated that Russia’s failure rate varied day-to-day, depended on the type of missile being launched, and could sometimes exceed 50 per cent. Two of them said it reached as high as 60 per cent.

One of the officials said the intelligence showed that Russia’s air-launched cruise missiles had a failure rate in the 20 to 60 per cent range, depending on the day.

Russia has been seen fielding two types of air-launched cruise missiles in Ukraine, the Kh-555 and Kh-101, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank’s Missile Defense Project.

Reuters could not determine what a standard failure rate would be for air-launched cruise missiles. Two experts interviewed by Reuters said any failure rate of 20 per cent and above would be considered high.

The United States believes Russia fired air-launched cruise missiles from Russian airspace earlier this month when it attacked a Ukrainian military base near the Polish border, and one of the U.S. officials told Reuters there was a particularly high failure rate during this attack. The strike killed 35 people, according to Ukrainian authorities.

Missile attacks have been a feature of Russia’s invasion, with Russia announcing strikes against military targets including weapons depots.

The invasion has killed thousands and driven a quarter of Ukraine’s 44 million people from their homes. The bombardment has hit residential areas, schools and hospitals in Ukrainian cities including Kharkiv and the besieged port of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov.

Global News,North Korea confirms reports it has test-fired its biggest long-range missile to date,C,"North Korea says it test-fired its biggest-yet intercontinental range ballistic missile under the orders of authoritarian leader Kim Jong Un, who vowed to expand the North’s “nuclear war deterrent” while preparing for a “long-standing confrontation” with the United States.

The report by North Korean state media on Friday came a day after the militaries of South Korea and Japan said they detected the North launching an ICBM from an airport near capital Pyongyang in its first long-range test since 2017.

The launch extended a barrage of weapons demonstrations this year that analysts say are aimed at forcing the United States to accept the idea of North Korea as a nuclear power and remove crippling sanctions against its broken economy that has been further damaged by pandemic-related difficulties.

The Hwasong-17 ICBM, which was fired on a high trajectory to avoid the territorial waters of neighbors, reached a maximum altitude of 6,248 kilometers (3,880 miles) and traveled 1,090 kilometers (680 miles) during a 67-minute flight before landing in waters between North Korea and Japan, Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency said.

The agency claimed the test met desired technical objectives and proved that the ICBM system would be promptly operated during wartime conditions.

The South Korean and Japanese militaries had announced similar flight details, which analysts say suggested that the missile could reach targets 15,000 kilometers (9,320 miles) away when fired on normal trajectory with a warhead weighing less than a ton. That would place the entire U.S. mainland within striking distance.

Believed to be about 25 meters (82 feet) long, the Hwasong-17 is the North’s longest-range weapon and, by some estimates, the world’s biggest road mobile ballistic missile system. The missile was first revealed in a military parade in October 2020 and Thursday’s launch represented its first full-range test.

The KCNA published photos of the missile leaving a trail of orange flames as it soared from a launcher truck on the airport’s runway and Kim smiling and clapping as he celebrated with military officials from an observation deck.

The agency paraphrased Kim as saying that his new weapon would make the “whole world clearly aware” of the North’s bolstering nuclear forces. He vowed his military to acquire “formidable military and technical capabilities unperturbed by any military threat and blackmail and keep themselves fully ready for long-standing confrontation with the U.S. imperialists.”

South Korea’s military responded to Thursday’s launch with live-fire drills of its own missiles launched from land, a fighter jet and a ship, underscoring a revival of tensions as nuclear negotiations remain frozen. It said it confirmed readiness to execute precision strikes against North Korea’s missile launch points as well as command and support facilities.

Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters the United States requested an open Security Council meeting on the launch and looks forward to having it on Friday.

The United States also imposed fresh sanctions against five entities and individuals located in Russia and North Korea over transferring sensitive items to the North’s missile program, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said.

Thursday’s test was North Korea’s 12th round of weapons launches this year and represented the most provocative test since U.S. President Joe Biden took office.

North Korea’s resumption of nuclear brinkmanship reflects a determination to cement its status as a nuclear power and wrest badly needed economic concessions from Washington and others from a position of strength, analysts say. Kim may also feel a need to trumpet his military accomplishments to his domestic audience and drum up loyalty as he grapples with economic difficulties.

The North’s tests this year also included demonstrations of a purported hypersonic weapon, a long-range cruise missile and an intermediate range missile potentially capable of reaching Guam, a major U.S. military hub in the Pacific.

The U.S. and South Korean militaries had assessed that the North was preparing a full-range test of the Hwasong-17 following their analysis of two North Korean midrange launches in recent weeks, which they said included components of the new ICBM.

Following a highly provocative streak in nuclear explosive and ICBM tests in 2017, Kim suspended such testing in 2018 ahead of his first meeting with then-U.S. President Donald Trump.

But negotiations derailed after the collapse of the second Kim-Trump meeting in February 2019 when the Americans rejected North Korean demands for a major release of crippling U.S.-led sanctions against the North in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities.

The North’s previous ICBMs demonstrated potential range to reach the American homeland during three flight tests in 2017. The development of the larger Hwasong-17 possibly indicates an aim to arm it with multiple warheads to overwhelm missile defenses.

Kim presided over a ruling Workers’ Party meeting on Jan. 19, where Politburo members issued a veiled threat to end his moratorium on ICBM and nuclear tests, citing U.S. hostility.

South Korea’s military has also detected signs that North Korea was possibly restoring some of the tunnels at its nuclear testing ground that were detonated in May 2018, weeks ahead of Kim’s first meeting with Trump.

Some experts say the North may resume nuclear testing in coming months to claim it acquired an ability to build nuclear warheads small enough to fit on some of its new delivery systems, including the hypersonic missile.",https://globalnews.ca/news/8708545/north-korea-icbm-2022/,2022-03-24
Global News,"Fire torches seats, suite area at Denver Broncos’ stadium",C,"Firefighters extinguished a blaze that torched several rows of seats and a suite area at the Denver Broncos’ stadium on Thursday.

The fire broke out on the fourth level at Empower Field at Mile High just after 2 p.m. and spread to the third level, where it burned at least six rows of seats in two sections. Firefighters quickly brought the blaze under control but were trying to determine if it had spread to other areas of the football stadium, which seats 76,125 people.

Stadium officials said in a statement on Twitter that the fire occurred in a construction zone near the East Club Lounge. At least 100 people were attending an event on the second level, but the stadium was otherwise empty.

About 75 firefighters were on scene at the height of the blaze. No injuries were reported.

Denver Fire Department
@Denver_Fire
#DenverFireDepartment crews are extinguishing a fire at Mile high stadium, 1701 Bryant. Unknown cause at this time, but fire affected has affected the suite are and the third level seating area.

Footage from a news helicopter showed several firefighters using water hoses to extinguish the blaze, which sent a large plume of black smoke billowing out of the stadium near downtown Denver. The Denver Fire Department tweeted several photos showing large flames spreading through the seating area.

Capt. Greg Pixley, a spokesman for the fire department, said it appears the fire originated in the suite but was partially suppressed by a sprinkler system. It then spread to the seats, which are made of plastic.

“This type of plastic that the seats are composed of burns with not only significant ferocity, very large flames, but also produces a tremendous amount of black smoke,” he said.

Investigators have not said what caused the fire, which burned at least 1,000 square feet (93 square meters).

A welder’s torch was blamed for starting a similar fire that burned plastic seats in the west stands of the old Mile High Stadium in January 2002.

“Our firefighters have an experience with this type of fire fight. … Any time that you have a fire on an upper level, you’re going to have to move a great deal of equipment to that environment. So our firefighters brought a number of heavy pieces of hose and equipment, saws and the like, to be able to help them extinguish this fire,” Pixley said Thursday.",https://globalnews.ca/news/8708442/denver-broncos-stadium-fire/,2022-03-24
Global News,Thousands of Canadian seniors scramble to file taxes following federal error,C,"It has been a taxing time for tens of thousands of Canadian seniors who haven’t been able to file their 2021 tax returns yet.

Global News has heard from a number of seniors scrambling to meet the May 2, 2022 deadline, due to their federal slips not yet arriving.

Dave Sim, 80, of Calgary has been checking his mailbox daily — but no luck yet.

“This is getting ridiculous,” he told Global News.

Employers and other payers have a deadline of Feb. 28 to provide an information slip, usually a T4 Statement of Remuneration Paid, which informs the recipient and the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) exactly how much was earned in the previous year.

But this year, some seniors faced a delay that was no fault of their own.

“It gets a craw in my backside,” Sim said. “I can’t believe they (federal government) can’t adhere to their own law.”

Sim is on Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) and is worried if he doesn’t get the information to the CRA on time, he may not receive the various benefits he’s entitled to and can’t go without.

“No we can’t. We’ll have to go looking to borrow money from the family.”

Shirley Maier operates Total Tax & Accounting in Calgary. Not only has she, as a senior, faced a delay personally, so have many of her clients.

“I had quite of a few of them panicking,” she said.

She agreed that the biggest concern she’s hearing is the possible loss of much-needed benefits if the deadline is missed.

“You have to file by the due date, which this year is May 2,” she said. “And if you’re entitled to some supplements, those begin in July.

“So if you’re late filing, you could very well miss your first payment.”

Federal government response
Global News reached out to the federal government for a response.

In a statement, Employment and Social Development Canada officials said:

“There will be no impact as individuals have until May 2, 2022 to file.”

It went on to describe what happened.

“In August 2021, Service Canada issued the One-Time Payment of $500 for Older Seniors (OTP) to 3.4 million seniors who will be 75 by June 2022. Service Canada is obligated to issue a T4A tax slip to recipients.

“However, due to an administrative error, a limited number (67,797) of OTP recipients received an incorrect tax slip in which the payment amount of $500 was entered into the document twice.”

The statement also said Service Canada acted immediately to correct the error and prevent further incorrect tax slips from being sent. It then sent amended tax slips in time for the tax filing season.

But Maier questioned that response, adding she too got her slips late, and she is not 75 years old, so it could not have just happened to those 75 years or older.

Global News put that question to the government, but has not yet heard back.

Officials did say seniors are able to log in to their “My Account” on the CRA website to get the updated and correct information.

But Maier said that’s not really an option for all her senior clients.

“First of all, they don’t have computers,” she said. “Second of all, they don’t have printers. And third of all, they don’t have the wherewithal to sign up for My Account at Revenue Canada or Service Canada.”

Sim does his own taxes but said he will not do them online.

“I am old school,” he said. “I like to have the paper and know what I’m doing with it. Then I enter it on the tax return.”

Federal officials said all seniors affected by the error should receive their tax slips no later than the week of March 14, a deadline that has already passed for Sim.

Global News,COVID-19 wastewater data shows cases are rising again across Canada,C,"Surveillance of wastewater data is suggesting that COVID-19 cases are on the rise again in Canada as provinces have eased public health restrictions.

The resurgence is taking place in Ontario, Alberta, Saskatchewan and parts of British Columbia, according to an analysis by Global News.

“The reality is that as all of the restrictions come off in terms of masking and the other measures which have been in place for some period of time, we can expect that more cases are going to be out there,” said Dr. Steve Hrudey, chair of the research advisory group of the Canadian Water Network COVID 19 Wastewater Coalition.

“The next few days to weeks are going to be important to watch,” he said.

The wastewater signals are correlating with the reported infections through testing, but they paint a more accurate and full picture of how prevalent COVID-19 actually is in the community, experts say.

People infected with COVID-19 can shed the coronavirus through their stool, even if they do not have any symptoms, making the testing of a community’s sewage an important tool that can work in tandem with clinical testing data, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC).

“Wastewater testing provides a true picture of COVID-19 community health, especially in the current situation when resources for clinical testing may be limited in some areas,” said Anna Maddison, a PHAC spokesperson, in an emailed statement to Global News.

So what is Canada’s sewage water telling us about the latest COVID-19 spread?

Ontario
In the province of Ontario, following a dip in February, COVID-19 cases started spiking in early March, coinciding with the province’s phased reopening.

This is according to the Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table, which is monitoring data from across 101 wastewater treatment plants, pumping stations and sewer sheds in 34 public health units.

Dr. Peter Juni, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of Toronto and scientific director of Ontario’s COVID-19 Science Advisory Table, said since Tuesday they have seen a “relatively steep increase” in coronavirus prevalence in the wastewater consistently in all regions in the province.

He said together with test positivity, the wastewater data is an early indicator that “as expected, we’re seeing a resurgence now.”

“There is a lag between what we are seeing in wastewater and in case counts,” Juni said.

“It remains to be seen how much of what we’re seeing in wastewater will eventually translate also into hospital occupancy,” he added.

Juni said since only 10 per cent of all infections are reported through testing, the actual case count in the province is likely 10 times higher.

“These 2,000 cases are more like 20,000 cases. In fact, when we use wastewater directly to triangulate case counts, we estimate that we’re at between 20 and 25,000 cases of infections daily,” he said.

Alberta
It’s a similar story in Alberta, where an upward trend started in early March, according to wastewater samples collected, processed and reported by teams at the University of Alberta and the University of Calgary.

This data covers more than 80 per cent of Alberta’s population.

Hrudey, professor emeritus at the University of Alberta, said recent data does suggest that cases are climbing back up in the province, but not dramatically so as of yet.

Saskatchewan
Researchers at the University of Saskatchewan are keeping a close eye on the wastewater trends of COVID-19 in Saskatoon, Prince Albert and North Battleford.

As of March 16, the viral load in Saskatoon’s wastewater increased by 66.3 per cent compared to the weekly average of the previous week.

“This increase in viral RNA load is indicative of an increase in SARS-CoV-2 infections in Saskatoon, which — in a partially vaccinated population — may or may not be reflected by new case numbers in upcoming weeks,” the USak researchers noted.

“The trend over the last three weeks has been increasing which indicates a double wave for the Omicron wave driven by the BA.2 subvariant,” they said.

In Prince Alberta, the viral load in wastewater was up by 96.1 per cent and in North Battleford by 93.2 per cent, data showed.

British Columbia
However, in British Columbia, the increase is less prominent for now.

This is according to the surveillance at five wastewater treatment plants, presenting 50 per cent of the province’s population.

Of the five regions being monitored by the B.C. Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) and Metro Vancouver, COVID-19 prevalence was only seen rising in Fraser and North Shore.

What the sewage data can tell us about COVID-19
Experts say wastewater surveillance has proven to be an effective tool for tracking COVID-19 trends and predicting future outbreaks.

“When you’re using wastewater surveillance, it’s a tool that helps you recognize very early how much community activity there is before people start becoming sick,” said Dr. Donald Vinh, an infectious disease specialist and medical microbiologist at the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC).

It is also a harbinger of increased hospitalizations and deaths, he said.

Going forward, wastewater monitoring is going to be very important, both in the short term for COVID-19 and in the longer term for other types of germs, Vinh said.

However, this type of surveillance also has its limitations as it does not indicate which individuals, households or age groups are infected, he said.",https://globalnews.ca/news/8705760/covid-wastewater-data-cases-rising-canada/,2022-03-24
Global News,Hidden room above Lviv train station shelters traumatized Ukrainian women and babies,C,"Valentina Kurushenko ran through a field, carrying her six-week-old granddaughter, as Russian shells exploded over her hometown of Kherson.

Kurushenko fled the Russian-occupied city on Friday with her 22 year-old daughter and drove for two days, covering almost 900 km, to reach Lviv, a safe haven in western Ukraine for thousands fleeing Russian troops.

Now, the trio wait in a small, hidden room above Lviv train station’s still crowded platforms, alongside dozens of other women and young children who have left everything behind to escape death in some of Ukraine’s most besieged cities.

“Our house is destroyed. Only the walls are remaining,” Kurushenko says through a translator, rocking her sleeping granddaughter in her arms as her daughter sits, head bowed, on a mattress nearby.

“We managed to escape to here without almost anything.”

It is the same story for many of the women in this room, tucked away on the third floor of the grand Lviv-Holovnyi railway station, an imposing Art Noveau building that stands sentinel over the busy platforms.

While the refugee flows have slowed as the war in Ukraine enters its fourth week, Lviv mayor Andriy Sudovyi estimates the train station is still welcoming about 10,000 people per day, from its peak of about 60,000 — but this could rise again if Russian aggression in other areas continues to escalate.

More than 200,000 refugees remain in Lviv, Sadovyi said, and the refugee crisis was costing the city $1 million per day.

As of March 19, it’s estimated 3.4 million people have fled Ukraine, while 6.5 million within the country have been displaced. Many of those people head for Lviv, renowned as the country’s cultural heart, and a western city which has been largely untouched by the devastation wrought elsewhere.

The streets of Lviv, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, remain relatively calm as strikes bear down on Mariupol, Mykolaiv and Kyiv, but Russian forces fired a warning shot at the city late last week, hitting an aircraft repair facility at the airport.

Further strikes on the humanitarian hub that the city has become seem likely. But for now, for many, it is the safest place in the country.

A cacophony of confusion
As the train doors open on carriages from Kyiv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Ternopil, crowds of predominantly women and children flood the platforms, toting small suitcases and plastic bags — whatever they could gather in time.

Many of them have left fathers, husbands and brothers behind; men of fighting age, between 18 and 60, are not allowed to leave the country under a presidential decree, in case they get called up to fight.

While most of the incoming refugees head straight out the station’s main entrance, converging on a makeshift humanitarian centre outside, complete with medical tents, food stalls and a man playing ‘Let It Go’ on the piano, other, more vulnerable, refugees are directed in another direction.

Up two flights of stairs, and through a set of large wooden doors, is a safe space set aside for women and young children who need emergency shelter while they figure out their next steps.

Thin mattresses are laid out side-by-side on the floor, blankets and pillows strewn across their surface. A food bench has been erected at the front, brimming with hot drinks, bread and fruit. The room is a cacophony of confusion — babies wailing, children screaming with joy as they run after each other, unaware of the danger they’ve just left behind, and mothers cajoling those who won’t quiet.

Kurushenko and her daughter found a brief moment of respite here as they await transportation to get to Poland to stay with relatives. As Kurushenko describes her escape, there is a weary, haunted look on her face, typical of many others in this room.

The port city of Kherson, near the border of the Russian-annexed Crimean peninsula, was  one of the first in Ukraine to fall under Russian control. Home to more than 280,000 people, much of the outskirts of the city are now destroyed.

On Monday, Russian soldiers used stun grenades and gunfire to break up a protest in the city. Videos from the scene show hundreds of protesters approaching a city square before being forced to run away after automatic gunfire breaks out.

Kurushenko says Russians occupied her home before it was shelled and almost completely destroyed.

She describes her escape from the city as “running through a field under the shelling.” Her husband remains in Kherson in the city’s self defense unit, as does her daughter’s partner. Her daughter does not raise her head the entire time we speak to her mother, instead staring transfixed into her mostly empty suitcase.

'I can't live under the shelling anymore'
Nearby, Alena Seitch sits on a mattress, her hand placed protectively on the back of her sleeping one-year-old son, as her eight-year-old son wanders around in the background, eating a cookie. The family arrived in Lviv from Sumy, in north-east Ukraine, through a humanitarian corridor. Sumy has been subjected to intense Russian shelling.

Seitch was supposed to travel to Poland where she had organized refugee accommodation, but arrived in Lviv to the news that was no longer available. Now, she’s planning on staying with relatives in a town nearby.

“I can’t live under the shelling anymore. I’m not ready to sleep in a train station,” she says, through tears.

“I had a train to Poland, but when I realized no one will take us there and won’t provide us with accommodation, I changed the ticket and I reached out to my relatives.”

Seitch is a professional gymnast, demonstrated by her delicate posture as she sits on the mattress, her left leg bent underneath her right, her right leg extended in front of her and toes pointed.

She was a gymnastics trainer before the war, she explains, showing off videos of the highly decorated young girls she trains in Sumy on her phone, competing at past international competitions. Her girls have all escaped Ukraine, she says, because “they are rich and could do it.”

Seitch has not eaten in four days, because she is nervous and stressed. She says she stayed in Sumy for as long as she could, before the sound of explosions became too much. Her mother remains there, because she refused to leave her home.

“When you’re hearing the shelling all the time you think you’re going to be buried under this building,” Seitch says.

Everything she is doing is “a sacrifice for my children,” she says, the impact on whom she is visibly distressed over.

While her one-year-old is too young to understand what is happening, she says her eight-year-old has started wetting the bed and even now in Lviv, in relative safety, he holds his head in his hands and adopts the fetal position every time he hears an air raid siren.

“He’s very, very strong. He is a sportsman like me, but because of this situation, our nerves have mostly reached their limit,” she says.

Drivers deliver orphans from cities under fire
Every woman in this room has a similarly distressing story. Another mother of two, called Anya, arrived here with her sister and her two young children. She says her parents remain behind in the basement of her home.

“I had a call with my parents…. and they said to us a shell had landed, like, not far from them but they didn’t know where exactly. Now they don’t have a mobile connection.”

Volunteers rush around in the background delivering hot tea and snacks to vacant faces as children somersault across mattresses nearby. A group of volunteers carrying a stretcher wave people out of the way as they deliver a small figure, draped in a blanket, to another room at the back of the hall.

Olha Slushinska stands at the front of the room and directs newcomers. Her eyes become glassy as she speaks of the people she has met over the past three weeks.

She remembers a mother and baby arriving the first day they opened this room, the day after the war broke out, on Feb. 25. The baby was totally naked, draped in a blanket. That moment has stuck with her.

Volunteers have come from all over, she says, including an Italian man who showed up not speaking a word of English or Ukrainian and just left yesterday.

Orphans and children are also arriving without parents and are being sent to nearby churches and refugee camps set up inside Lviv schools and kindergartens.

She speaks fondly about a man who is driving back and forth from here to the front lines, picking up orphans and delivering them here. She hasn’t heard from him in a couple of days and is worried.

Shlushinksa isn’t sure of the capacity of the room but says it is always full, especially at night. She watches women silently grieving, “passing on the emotion to their children.”

“Each person is very emotional. One person can seem very stable and do emotional things very easily,” she says.

Slushinska has worked here since the beginning of the war and will continue to do so for as long as it continues. She feels duty-bound to do so.

“I feel that for people out there it’s more difficult than here. I know a lot of women are in basements seeing explosions,” she says.

“So we are trying to support these people as much as possible.”",https://globalnews.ca/news/8697696/lviv-train-station-women-babies/,2022-03-21
Global News,Feds table bill to protect the number of Quebec seats in House of Commons,C,"The federal government has tabled legislation to ensure Quebec does not lose a seat when Canada’s electoral map is redrawn.

It presented a bill Thursday to protect Quebec’s voice in Parliament after it faced losing a seat in an upcoming redistribution based on population.

The bill would prevent Quebec’s number of seats dropping to 77 from its current tally of 78.

The legislation comes days after a commitment by the Liberal government to protect the number of Commons seats in Quebec in the text of a deal with the NDP.

If approved by Parliament, the bill amending the Constitution Act would make sure that the number of MPs from each province does not drop below the number they had before the last election.

Because Quebec’s population has declined, it stood to lose an MP in the upcoming redistribution of seats, while other provinces with growing populations, including Alberta, would gain MPs. The last time a province lost a seat in a redistribution was in 1966.

The move follows a motion tabled by the Bloc Québécois rejecting the proposal to redraw the electoral map in a way that reduces the province’s political weight in the House of Commons.

A number of government departments worked on the text of the bill, but it will be championed through Parliament by Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Dominic LeBlanc.

“The seat allocation and the electoral boundaries readjustment process is an important part of our democracy. It ensures the House of Commons reflects the changing nature of Canada’s demographic profile and that all Canadians’ voices are effectively heard,” said LeBlanc.

On Thursday, Pablo Rodriguez, the government’s Quebec lieutenant, said the bill is “realistic” and would “solve the problem today, right now in the most practicable way possible for Quebec.”

Ten independent electoral boundaries commissions will report on any changes needed to electoral districts following the seat allocation. The commissions will hold public hearings later this year before submitting their reports on new electoral districts to Parliament.",https://globalnews.ca/news/8708249/feds-table-bill-to-protect-the-number-of-quebec-seats-in-house-of-commons/,2022-03-24

The premier made the news public on social media Thursday afternoon.

In a Twitter post, Legault said he began experiencing COVID-19-like symptoms earlier in the day and a screening test came back positive.

“I feel well,” Legault wrote in French, adding he will be following public health guidelines and work remotely for the next five days.

Legault, who is 64, also urged Quebecers to remain cautious.

He pointed to a recent rise in daily cases as evidence that the virus is still present in Quebec.

“Let’s continue to be careful. We’ll get through this together!” he wrote.

The Washington Post,U.S. asylum officers will have larger role in border screenings under new Biden policy,C,"The Biden administration is preparing to implement a new border policy later this spring to ease massive backlogs in U.S. immigration courts by giving U.S. asylum officers a bigger role in screening migrants, officials announced Thursday.

Under the new policy, asylum officers at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services will have the authority to grant humanitarian protection to migrants taken into custody along the border. If the officers determine an asylum seeker does not qualify, the case will be forwarded to a U.S. immigration judge, reaching the courts at a more advanced stage in the process, officials said.

The goal of the rule change will be to complete asylum cases within months, not years, as has become the norm in a U.S. immigration court system crippled by 1.6 million pending cases.

“The current system for handling asylum claims at our borders has long needed repair,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement. “Through this rule, we are building a more functional and sensible asylum system to ensure that individuals who are eligible will receive protection more swiftly, while those who are not eligible will be rapidly removed.”

Biden officials have describe the “asylum officer rule” as one of the administration’s most consequential policy changes at the border. But under the implementation plans officials have described, it appears doubtful the new rule could have a major impact in the coming months when migration levels are high, and climbing higher.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection made more than 1.7 million arrests along the Mexico border during the 2021 fiscal year that ended in September, a record. Illegal crossings this year are on pace to exceed that total, and the number of migrants taken into U.S. custody this month is on pace to be the highest since last August, preliminary CBP figures show.

Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, U.S. agents have used the Title 42 public health order to rapidly expel or deport most migrants, including asylum seekers. But under normal immigration proceedings, some migrants have avoided deportation or stalled the process by expressing a fear of harm or persecution if returned to their home countries.

They are typically able to live and work legally in the United States while their asylum cases are pending, and the slow pace of the process is widely viewed as an incentive to file meritless claims. A 2020 DHS report found 89 percent of the Central American migrants who arrived as part of a family group between 2014 and 2020 remained in the United States, most with pending immigration cases.

Officials declined to say how many asylum officers they have added or how many migrants they expect to be able to screen under the new procedures once the changes take effect in late May or early June.

“There will be a very careful, slow ramp-up of cases into this system,” said a USCIS official who briefed reporters on the condition that the official would not be identified. “We do not anticipate having a large number of individuals placed in this process in the first weeks and months as well make sure the process functions the way we anticipate that it should.”

Doris Meissner, director of the U.S. policy program at the Migration Policy Institute in Washington, said the timetables outlined by the administration would be a “significant reform.” The policy outlines an asylum process that would be fully adjudicated in six months or less.

“If accomplishing that requires starting with modest numbers of cases, that makes sense from a standpoint of resources and ensuring the process works effectively,” said Meissner, whose 2018 reform recommendations were used by the Biden administration to develop the rule change.

The new policy change will not apply to unaccompanied children or teens who arrive without a parent. It will only apply to individuals the government is seeking to deport using the fast-track process known as expedited removal proceedings.

The Biden administration first announced its plans for the policy change last August, triggering a public comment period that drew 5,000 submissions, officials said.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/03/24/us-asylum-officers-will-have-larger-role-border-screenings-under-new-biden-policy/,2022-03-24

NORTH MACEDONIA!!! ONE OF THE GREAT UPSETS OF ALL TIME 🤯

AS IT STANDS, ITALY ARE OUT OF THE WORLD CUP!

North Macedonia, which gained independence amid the dissolution of Yugoslavia in 1991, has a population of just over 2 million, considerably less than Rome alone. The Balkan nation will play Portugal on Tuesday with a chance to qualify for the World Cup for the first time.

Italy, meanwhile, will spend another four years trying to get back to a tournament in which it has been highly successful. The Azzurri have won the World Cup four times, second only to Brazil (with five) and tied with Germany, and they have twice been runners-up. Before 2018, the last time Italy failed to qualify for the World Cup was 1958.

In between the two recent failures on the world stage, Italy won the 2020 European championship, a triumph that only serves to underscore how improbable Thursday’s result was. In fact, the country had never lost a World Cup qualifying match at home; it entered the day with a 48-0-11 record.

The Washington Post,Sen. Manchin launches new push for ‘all of the above’ energy bill,C,"Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) has restarted talks with fellow Democrats about reviving the party’s climate and social spending bill, according to two people familiar with the matter, as administration officials search for oil and gas policies that could make the measure more palatable to him.

Manchin, who has traveled in the past week with Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, has told staff members and colleagues that the legislation must be voted on before senators leave town in August, according to the two people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations.

Manchin, who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, has said that he wants the bill to take an “all-of-the-above” approach to energy policy, these people said, and that it’s still possible to reach a deal that includes billions of dollars’ worth of provisions to tackle climate change, cut prescription drug costs and update the tax code.

He has also indicated that he wants the Biden administration to make some concessions related to oil and gas drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and natural gas exports, they added. The current five-year plan for offshore oil and gas leasing in federal waters expires June 30, and the Interior Department is running behind schedule in drafting a new one, which has frustrated drilling proponents.

Without a new five-year plan, the federal government cannot auction off oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico once the current one expires. Administration officials are looking at what policies aimed at boosting domestic energy production they can offer to win over Manchin’s support, according to one of the individuals familiar with these discussions, including possible offshore lease sales that Interior has said can move forward in light of a recent appellate court ruling.

A spokeswoman for the Interior Department, Melissa Schwartz, declined to comment.

Manchin spokeswoman Sam Runyon declined to say whether the senator was open to restarting negotiations over the bill, which President Biden had named the Build Back Better Act.

“Senator Manchin is always willing to engage in discussions about the best way to move our country forward,” Runyon said in an email. “He has made clear that we can protect energy independence and respond to climate change at the same time.”

Manchin’s still-strained relationship with the White House could complicate any negotiations, according to the individuals briefed on the talks. The relationship soured dramatically in late December, when White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain had a hand in drafting an unusually bitter statement excoriating Manchin for coming out publicly against the social spending bill.

It is unclear whether a deal can take shape by the end of July, after which point it will become difficult to move major legislation in advance of the midterm elections. And the Senate’s attention is occupied by the confirmation hearings for Biden’s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson.

White House national climate adviser Gina McCarthy on Thursday said Biden is ready to reengage with Manchin on tax credits and other policies aimed at boosting clean energy and electric vehicles.

Biden will “talk to Senator Manchin and anybody else” about the provisions, McCarthy said at an event hosted by the American Council on Renewable Energy, adding, “I am optimistic, but I am not naive. I think we’ll have an ability to move this forward.”

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), one of Congress’s most vocal climate advocates, said in an interview Wednesday that Manchin appears to be onboard with the clean energy tax credits as well as a fee on emissions of methane, a potent planet-warming gas.

Manchin spent last Friday with Haaland and Granholm as they promoted provisions in the bipartisan infrastructure law in his home state of West Virginia.

Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) — who had tried unsuccessfully to win Manchin’s support for a program shifting power companies away from fossil fuels — said she was encouraged to hear of the “good discussion” on Friday between Manchin and Granholm, who both traveled to Paris this week for the International Energy Agency’s ministerial meeting.

“There seems to be the contours for a good agreement, especially on the clean energy tax credits,” Smith said in an interview Wednesday.

Manchin on Friday praised the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for reconsidering a policy launched last month to evaluate how pipelines and other natural gas projects affect climate change, and its approval of three new pipeline projects.

“Energy security for America and our allies is dependent on FERC’s ability to move much needed energy infrastructure projects forward,” he said in a statement. “To do so they must maintain clear and predictable policies that strike the right balance between energy security, affordability and environmental considerations.”

Biden administration and European officials also announced a new partnership Friday to redirect gas exports to Europe, part of a broader push to reduce Europe’s dependence on Russian energy amid the war in Ukraine. Under the agreement, the United States will work with other nations to increase liquefied natural gas exports to Europe by at least 15 billion cubic meters this year, with the aim of providing larger shipments in the future.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/03/24/manchin-build-back-better-climate/,2022-03-24
The Washington Post,Small lab that got $187 million for covid testing put patients in ‘jeopardy’,C,"The drive-through coronavirus testing site, a metal shipping container in the parking lot of an Indianapolis shopping mall, gave Bridgette Alexander pause.

The man administering tests at the site, run by a company called O’Hare Clinical Lab Services, was wearing jeans and a leather jacket, not medical scrubs or a gown. He moved among the cars without changing gloves, she said. He asked for her driver’s license but not her insurance card.

But Alexander was feeling ill and desperate to make sure she didn’t pass covid-19 to her husband, a kidney transplant recipient. The rapid test came back negative that day, Dec. 23, providing temporary relief, she said.

Five days later, still sick, she went to a hospital. The test there came back positive. Her husband soon fell ill, too. He was hospitalized with covid-19 in mid-January and has remained on a ventilator since then, Alexander said.

While false negatives occur on antigen tests, Alexander now believes the first test was wholly unreliable. “I felt like the O’Hare results affected me. If I had been given real results, I could have been more cautious,” she said. “I could have done more.”

Once a small lab based out of a suburban strip mall that provided clinical tests for nursing homes and assisted-living centers near Chicago, O’Hare morphed into a testing juggernaut during the pandemic, setting up more than 100 pop-up coronavirus testing sites across the country, some little more than the shipping containers, records show.

In just 15 months, the company collected $187 million in federal money, according to government records, as it shifted its business focus and emerged as one of the nation’s largest test providers through a new program that reimbursed providers for the costs of testing the uninsured.

Last month, federal regulators suspended O’Hare’s license to operate a lab and cut off federal payments, previously unreported documents obtained by The Washington Post show. The sanction capped a string of safety concerns that date to the lab’s foray into coronavirus testing in late 2020 and, in some cases, allegedly put people at risk of serious injury or death, according to interviews and an examination of records by The Post.

O’Hare’s rise illustrates the shortcomings of the federal government’s approach to coronavirus testing and provides a portrait of a freewheeling segment of the testing industry that ballooned during the pandemic amid a massive infusion of government money.

Absent a robust public health testing infrastructure, the federal government directed billions of dollars to private health companies to provide coronavirus testing for the uninsured, creating lucrative opportunities for large, established firms as well as more obscure companies with spotty safety records.

The lab director who was responsible for attesting to O’Hare’s safety procedures and worked for O’Hare during most of the pandemic told The Post that she resigned because she had been kept in the dark about the company’s network of pop-up locations. Two other former employees said in interviews that they did not do the jobs attributed to them on documents O’Hare submitted to health regulators last year that listed the lab’s key safety personnel and their roles.

In addition to collecting samples that were sent back to O’Hare’s lab in Chicago for PCR testing, the remote sites offered free rapid antigen tests, tests that were not authorized under O’Hare’s license, records show. Patients complained repeatedly to attorneys general in multiple states that they never got their testing results from O’Hare, documents show.

One remote site in Wisconsin had no electricity or running water and only a kerosene generator for warmth despite the need to keep rapid tests at room temperature, a federal inspection shows. A federal inspection at the main O’Hare site in Chicago in December 2020 found lab workers moved back and forth between the lab and an adjacent open kitchen for breaks in their protective gear.

State health inspectors in Indiana witnessed “deficiencies in the performance of testing” at the site Alexander visited and one other, according to federal inspectors who cited the state findings — without greater detail — in a more extensive report explaining why reimbursements were stopped until O’Hare could demonstrate it had a credible plan to improve.

“O’Hare Clinical Lab made some mistakes due to the extensive and sudden demand for its services during the pandemic,” Stephen Lee, an attorney for O’Hare, said in an emailed statement in response to The Post’s findings. “O’Hare Clinical Lab has been working to address the issues raised by regulators in late 2021. O’Hare has suspended all testing until it resolves all regulatory issues.”

The lab did not address most of the detailed questions posed by The Post.

In a statement for this story, the federal agency that regulates clinical labs, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, cited its sanctions against O’Hare in February that halted further payments to the lab and suspended its license.

“Throughout the pandemic, CMS has taken swift and aggressive action to identify and investigate fraud and support law enforcement agencies,” the statement said. The agency is “committed to preventing fraud and protecting people with Medicare from falling victim to scams.”


The Post review is based on lab inspection reports and license applications, court documents, state incorporation records, consumer complaints filed in multiple states, and interviews with patients and the three former O’Hare employees.

O’Hare ranked eighth among more than 30,000 companies that have been reimbursed a total of $11.3 billion for providing testing to the uninsured, according to a government database. Most of the other top 10 companies are well-established, publicly traded commercial labs, such as Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp.

But O’Hare’s work is not alone in drawing attention from regulators and other authorities.

The FBI has executed search warrants at the locations of two other Chicago coronavirus testing companies that also set up pop-up sites and collected tens of millions of dollars for carrying out coronavirus testing of the uninsured, searches reported by USA Today and Block Club Chicago. The FBI declined to comment on any investigations into the labs. The two labs, Doctors Clinical Laboratory and LabElite, also rank among the nation’s top 25 government-funded providers of testing for the uninsured, having collected $152 million and $77 million under the program, respectively.

The scrutiny of the testing companies comes as the Biden administration announced in early March that the Justice Department would appoint a chief prosecutor and create a task force to investigate fraud in the government’s pandemic spending.

O’Hare’s expansion into coronavirus testing was overseen by Mohamed Siraj, who took over management of the lab in September 2020 and now owns it, according to documents and interviews.

In recent years, Siraj, 49, has managed companies focused on real estate investment, website design and laundry service, as well as storefront medical clinics and a same-day surgical center, according to court and state incorporation records.

Siraj in a brief phone call declined an interview and referred a Post reporter to an attorney, who in turn directed the request to a public relations firm. Siraj did not respond to another request to talk left at his office or to an interview request sought among a list of questions posed to the company.

O’Hare’s beginnings
O’Hare started modestly.

Launched in 2006, its clients were mostly nursing homes and assisted-living centers in the Chicago area, and it never generated more than $2 million in annual revenue over the following decade, according to Frank Perez, one of two founders. Perez, 55, stepped down as co-owner in 2016, and the other founder, Mohd Emad Jaber, took over sole ownership of the lab, Perez said. Jaber declined to comment through an attorney, Josh Herman.

O’Hare told regulators last year that Jaber, 64, had a master’s degree in clinical lab sciences and 40 years of experience.

As far back as 2015, regulators found lapses at the lab, according to interviews and documents obtained from the Illinois Department of Public Health through public records requests.

That year, O’Hare was temporarily ordered to stop cholesterol testing after it failed multiple examinations of its testing procedures, according to a government-approved lab accreditation organization called COLA. In an interview, Perez described the failure as a minor error by a lab worker and said the issue was resolved. O’Hare passed examinations the following year, according to COLA.

In 2019, an inspector for CMS found the lab was not properly documenting storage requirements and expiration dates for lab materials and was violating regulations that require written procedures for handling patient specimens. The lab accepted the findings and said it would fix the labeling problem and update its policies, according to the federal inspection report.

The following year, O’Hare moved to its current location on the far West Side of Chicago, on the third floor of a brick office building that it shares with a charter high school. The move coincided with Siraj’s involvement in the lab. O’Hare signed an agreement in September 2020 that made one of Siraj’s companies, Chicago Polyclinic, the management firm of the lab with responsibility for O’Hare’s operations, marketing and accounting, according to a letter provided by a spokesman for O’Hare. O’Hare declined to answer questions about exactly when the move and the new ownership occurred.

Siraj also helped finance O’Hare during the pandemic and would later manage its pop-up testing sites, O’Hare’s attorney, Lee, said in the emailed statement.

Chicago Polyclinic, launched in May 2020, is set among appliance and electronics shops and restaurants on the far North Side of Chicago. The clinic’s storefront advertises services for pain management and laser hair removal, as well as chiropractic services. It also advertises medical treatment after auto accidents and work injuries and promises “top settlement guaranteed.”

By December 2020, with the pandemic raging, O’Hare began performing only coronavirus testing, according to CMS records. It also began submitting claims to the federal government for testing the uninsured, according to a spokesman for the federal Health Resources and Services Administration.

Collecting payments from the government was relatively easy: Health-care providers entered a patient’s name into an electronic portal, along with other information, and attested that the patient did not have insurance. The payment to the provider would be made by direct deposit within 30 days, according to the HRSA website. The government reimbursed $100 per PCR test, according to the HRSA website. O’Hare’s lawyer said in a statement that the lab did not bill the government for rapid tests it performed at its remote sites.

The same month that O’Hare began receiving payments, a federal inspector visited its lab, documents show.

Touring on Dec. 30, 2020, the inspector found glaring safety violations: Specimens were tested in an area beside the open kitchen, which workers passed through without removing their gloves, masks or lab coats, according to the report.

The lab had already done 15,000 coronavirus tests at that point but still had not run its procedures through the verification process required to show its tests yielded accurate results, the inspector found.

Additionally, O’Hare was not reporting test results to public health officials as it was supposed to, according to the report. O’Hare lab workers explained to the inspector that they regularly gave the test results to the company’s accountant, who worked at a separate location, and they said they believed he was manually faxing the results to Illinois health officials.

The inspector also found that the lab director, who was not named in the report, was unqualified to run a “high-complexity laboratory.” The lab lacked other highly trained personnel required under federal regulations, too. And there were not enough qualified lab workers to perform either the volume or complexity of coronavirus tests they were doing, according to the inspection.

At the time, O’Hare was advertising seven walk-in sites for coronavirus testing — all in the Chicago area — according to an archived version of the lab’s website.

Problems and promises
O’Hare quickly tried to address the problems, according to documents it provided to regulators, including by bringing Smaranda Badescu aboard as the new lab director in January 2021.

A doctor and microbiologist, Badescu, 82, was in retirement but maintained the credentials and board certification to run a high-complexity lab. A native of Romania, she came to the United States when she was 50 and had worked as director of another Chicago lab, she said in a brief interview outside her home in February.

She told The Post that O’Hare “was a mess” before she came on and that Jaber, one of the lab’s founders, hired her to help set it right. “They were desperate,” she said.

She said she agreed to the job with conditions: She would mostly work remotely because she no longer felt comfortable driving on the highway, and she needed to care for her ill husband, she said. She estimated she visited the lab three times in person in total during her year with O’Hare. Badescu worked with regulators to get the lab in compliance, documents show.

The new lab director “solved and corrected many problems,” O’Hare wrote in a response to regulators on March 30 of last year, documents show.

O’Hare also told regulators that the lab had hired other qualified scientists and medical personnel, submitting a roster of employees and their credentials to the Illinois Department of Public Health. The roster, dated March 31, listed nine lab employees in all.

When contacted by a reporter, two of the people on the roster said that they had done little or no work for the lab.

Abdel Abdelhadi, identified as O’Hare’s quality assurance and regulatory officer, said through his lawyer that he never agreed to take on that role.

“Mr. Abdelhadi acted as an outside consultant to O’Hare Clinical Lab Services in a limited capacity in 2021,” attorney Eric Pruitt wrote. “He never served as O’Hare’s Quality Assurance and Regulatory Officer, nor did he serve in any other oversight or supervisory role within the lab. Any document or communication with regulatory authorities suggesting otherwise is incorrect and was made without Mr. Abdelhadi’s knowledge or authorization.”

Javed Nazir, a doctor of internal medicine in a Chicago suburb, is listed on the roster as the lab’s clinical consultant, a position that is required under federal regulations.

“I am on paper, but I don’t do anything for them,” he said when reached by phone in February, before hanging up. He declined to comment when a reporter later visited his office in La Grange, about 15 miles southwest of Chicago.

O’Hare also told federal regulators in January 2021 that it was performing only PCR tests and that it was analyzing specimens in only one location: its lab in Chicago. It repeated those claims in a document to regulators in March.

Pop-up sites proliferate
At the same time, O’Hare was taking steps to open new pop-up sites, according to court records.

Under a Jan. 26, 2021, agreement, O’Hare promised to pay a newly formed company called Express Covid Tests to set up more collection sites, according to a contract in a lawsuit Express filed in Illinois state circuit court.

O’Hare would pay $35 for each sample collected at the sites for PCR testing, as long as they numbered a least 5,000 a month, according to a copy of the contract — signed by Siraj for O’Hare — that was filed with the lawsuit. The contract provides that O’Hare would then seek reimbursement from the federal government or from insurance companies. It does not specify where the sites would be.

In its lawsuit, Express alleged that O’Hare owed it $241,000. The lawsuit, filed in December, is still in its early stages. O’Hare has not yet filed a response in court. Both O’Hare and Express declined to comment on the lawsuit.

In addition to collecting samples to send back to the lab in Chicago for PCR testing, the pop-up sites also offered free rapid antigen tests at each location, tests that were not authorized under O’Hare’s license.

Lee, the company’s attorney, acknowledged the error in the statement to The Post. “O’Hare’s management company mistakenly assumed in 2021 that antigen tests could be performed at collection sites,” he wrote.

Badescu said she was unaware of the more than 100 remote sites and therefore never developed safety procedures for them or training for site workers. Badescu said she also became increasingly busy with caring for her husband, whose condition worsened before he died of covid in December.

She said that at one point last year she asked Jaber where the PCR samples arriving at the lab were coming from. Jaber, who was still working as general supervisor of the lab, responded, “ ‘You shouldn’t worry, the management is taking care of it,’ ” Badescu recalls. O’Hare’s attorney said Jaber is no longer an employee or owner of the lab and that Siraj now owns O’Hare.

Siraj wrote a letter to Badescu on Nov. 24, 2021, saying he took “full responsibility for rolling out the antigen testing” without getting formal approval from O’Hare for expanding the rapid testing. O’Hare provided The Post a copy of the letter.

By late last year, O’Hare advertised testing collection sites beyond Illinois, in Kentucky, Louisiana, Florida, Wisconsin, Indiana, Minnesota, Massachusetts, California and Tennessee, according to an archived version of its website.

Some of the remote locations were set up without required permits from local authorities, according to the local officials. In Florida’s Miami-Dade County, for example, O’Hare advertised five testing sites. Each would have required a business permit from the county, said county spokeswoman Natalia Jaramillo. She said there were none on record. The company did not address The Post’s questions about approvals from local authorities.

As O’Hare extended its reach, samples for PCR testing were flooding into the Chicago lab.

O’Hare had told federal regulators it expected to perform 180,000 covid-19 PCR tests during all of 2021, according to a document it submitted in January 2021. But it would administer vastly more — some 284,000 tests in November and December 2021 alone — according to data the company provided to The Post.

A pivotal inspection
Among the O’Hare sites was a shipping container placed in the parking lot of an outlet mall in Pleasant Prairie, Wis., a village just south of Milwaukee in Kenosha County.

The county’s public health director, Jen Freiheit, told The Post she recalled getting a phone call from a representative of O’Hare last fall alerting her that the testing site was coming online. Testing options were limited at the time, so Freiheit said she was enthusiastic.

“They sounded legit,” she said about the O’Hare representative.

In late October, Kenosha County listed the O’Hare location on its website as a recommended testing option for both rapid and PCR tests. But soon after, Freiheit and other officials began getting complaints about the O’Hare site, including reports of collection workers not wearing protective equipment and patients not getting their results, she said.

She forwarded the complaints to state health officials and the county removed the location from its website, she said.

On the afternoon of Nov. 3, a CMS inspector visited the Pleasant Prairie site in response to a complaint. The inspector found a 10-foot-by-10-foot metal pod with a sign advertising “Free Covid testing.”

Inside, workers were performing rapid antigen tests that are supposed to be kept at room temperature to work properly. But it was in the low 40s outdoors, and the pod had only a small kerosene heater that emitted little heat, according to the report. It also lacked electricity, running water and a refrigerator.

The workers had collected 65 patient samples to send back to Chicago for PCR testing. None were labeled with patient information, as required, leading the inspector to conclude that the lab “failed to ensure positive identification and optimum integrity of a patient’s specimen from the time of collection through completion of testing and reporting of results.”

A week later the inspector went to O’Hare’s Chicago lab to investigate further. Asked for documentation showing that the workers at 50 collection sites advertised on its website had been properly trained, O’Hare produced records for only 15, the report shows.

The inspector also found that the samples tested by O’Hare were first sent to Siraj’s Chicago Polyclinic. Chicago Polyclinic did business under the name Devon Polyclinic, according to state corporation records. Devon performed tasks related to tracking and labeling O’Hare’s samples but was not authorized to do so, the inspector wrote.

The inspection, previously reported by Block Club Chicago, found the O’Hare lab had put patients in “immediate jeopardy.”

In response, O’Hare sent a letter on Nov. 24 to all the operators of its pop-up sites telling them to stop performing rapid antigen tests, according to CMS documents. But the Indianapolis site Alexander and her 17-year-old daughter Mariah went to in December was still offering those tests, and testing continued into mid-January, when the Indiana state inspectors were at the location and found “deficiencies in the performance of testing,"" federal records show.

By late last year, more than 45 complaints about O’Hare had poured in to state attorneys general in Florida, Illinois, Missouri and Kentucky, most from people who said they never received their results, according to records reviewed by The Post.

Mike Bass of Louisville was feeling rundown and achy when he scoured for a testing site in late December and was drawn to O’Hare’s advertising free, fast results and walk-ins. He has never received a record of his test results, he said.

After standing in line for about an hour with about 15 people, Bass said he had a rapid test from the lone employee who handled everything from passing out clipboards to swabbing noses and packing samples. He said he was told verbally he was negative.

But the 50-year-old began doubting the outcome as his symptoms persisted and took another rapid test the next day at a drugstore. That test showed he was positive, as did a PCR test at a university, Bass said.

Thinking about the plumbers and other contractors he had seen waiting at O’Hare, he said, “all these guys who were probably testing ‘negative’ that day, and going back to work,” Bass said. “Doing electrical work in someone’s house, or working at a bar, thinking that they’re fine.”

O’Hare declined to comment on individual cases.

O’Hare’s lab certification on the line
In January, after the Wisconsin inspection and the follow-up visit to O’Hare’s Chicago lab, O’Hare struggled to prove to regulators that it had addressed testing problems, CMS documents show.

Twice that month, O’Hare asked for extensions — that CMS granted — to make its case for why it should not be sanctioned.

When the company submitted paperwork, CMS found the explanations were “not credible” and stated that O’Hare still had not provided key information about its operation, including a list of all of its collection sites, a Feb. 10 letter to O’Hare obtained by The Post shows.

The letter also notified O’Hare that CMS was suspending O’Hare’s license and barring it from receiving Medicare or Medicaid money for any lab services.

Additionally, the CMS letter said, regulators had visited two O’Hare collection sites in Indiana in January and found still more violations.

The letter said O’Hare’s certificate to operate a lab would be revoked on April 11, unless the company appealed and persuaded the agency to reverse its decision at a hearing.

Badescu said she learned about the pop-up sites from the inspection report out of Wisconsin. She resigned from the lab in January and said she filed a complaint with a law enforcement agency but declined to identify the agency or elaborate on what her complaint contained.

In retrospect, she said, she feels the lab hired her believing she would not raise red flags.

“I think in their mind, they thought, she is female, she’s 82, she won’t see,” she said.

She said she was not involved in the lab’s billing or financial side and was surprised the lab had received $187 million from the federal government.

“I don’t understand how,” she said. “It’s absolutely unbelievable.”

The Washington Post,Deaths outpace births in most counties as U.S. growth slowed in 2020,C,"Almost three-fourths of all U.S. counties reported more deaths than births last year, a development largely caused by the pandemic, which contributed to a dramatic slowing in the overall population growth of the nation, according to data released Thursday by the Census Bureau.

Low fertility rates, which have persisted since the end of the Great Recession, and the continuing demographic shift toward an older population also combined to create the smallest population increase in 100 years, said Kenneth Johnson, a sociology professor and demographer at the University of New Hampshire.

Johnson said he expected the data to show a natural decrease but was surprised at its scale. Natural decrease occurs when a population records more deaths than births. “I think one of the most important findings is the fact that almost 2,300 counties had more deaths than births in them. That’s unheard of in American history,” he said.

He said the impact of the coronavirus, along with other trends that limited population growth, had created a “perfect storm,” and that one would have to go back at least to the 1918 flu pandemic to find anything like it.

The data also offered statistical backing to widespread anecdotal evidence suggesting that millions of Americans moved out of the largest cities in the nation, including the District, during the pandemic.

Whether for safety from infectious disease or convenience during shutdowns, millions of residents traded cities for suburbs or larger suburbs for smaller ones. Many migrated farther into rural counties or resettled to second homes in vacation areas, such as the Catskill Mountains or the Delmarva Peninsula.

The two largest cities in the nation, Los Angeles and New York, suffered the sharpest losses as a result of internal migration. Los Angeles County lost over 179,750 people in net domestic migration, while New York County lost over 113,640.

California, Oregon and Mississippi had the most counties negatively affected by international migration losses, while Alaska, Louisiana and Illinois had the most counties affected by losses caused by domestic migration within the United States.

Of course, the outflows from some states meant gains in others. Maricopa County in Arizona, which includes Phoenix, received the most people, with more than 46,860 flowing in, from other areas of the United States.

“I’m very surprised by this because I didn’t think it was going to be as dramatic, the domestic migration piece of it,” said William Frey, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, who analyzed the data and its impact on the Washington region. “It may be a blip, and I think it is, but it’s certainly noteworthy. I think that’s the bigger demographic pattern here.”

Frey said that although outward domestic migration from these and other major cities had been underway for many years, its effect had been masked by increases in foreign immigrants, but those numbers also slowed during the pandemic.

The data released Thursday covered roughly 3,140 counties, more than 380 metropolitan statistical areas and over 540 smaller locales known as micropolitan statistical areas. The period covered by the data, July 2020 to July 2021, also coincided with some of the peak rates of the spread of the coronavirus, as reflected in reported cases.

In that time, nearly 75 percent of all U.S. counties experienced a natural population decrease, compared with 55 percent of all counties in 2020 and 45 percent in 2019, the Census Bureau found. In Maine, Delaware, Rhode Island and New Hampshire, the natural population decrease occurred in every county.

The District recorded a loss of 20,040 people, driven mostly by domestic migration, while the Washington metropolitan area lost more than 29,000 people, Frey said. Montgomery County experienced a loss of more than 6,410 people, Prince George’s County reported a decline of nearly 10,300, and Fairfax County’s population declined by over 8,750. Prince William County added more than 1,730 people, Frey found.

The committee will meet Monday to consider a report recommending holding two former Trump White House officials — former trade and manufacturing director Peter Navarro and former communications chief Daniel Scavino Jr. — for criminal contempt of Congress. If the committee approves the matter, the House would vote on whether to refer Navarro and Scavino to the Justice Department for prosecution.

The bipartisan Jan. 6 panel is investigating the 2021 storming of the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob that tried to stop the confirmation of Joe Biden’s electoral college win, an attack that led to five deaths and left some 140 members of law enforcement injured.

The committee subpoenaed Scavino, along with several other former Trump advisers, last September, but an attorney for Trump instructed the group not to comply with congressional investigators. Trump’s legal team tried to argue that the former aides were protected by executive and other privileges, but President Biden rejected the executive privilege claims last month.

Scavino could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday.

Last month, the committee subpoenaed Navarro, who has written and publicly discussed the effort to develop a strategy to delay or overturn certification of the 2020 election. In a statement to Politico Thursday, Navarro called the committee’s impending contempt vote “an unprecedented partisan assault on executive privilege” and continued claiming executive privilege.

“Until this matter has been settled at the Supreme Court, where it is inevitably headed, the Committee should cease its tactic of harassment and intimidation,” Navarro told Politico. “I would be happy to cooperate with the committee in expediting a review of this matter by the Supreme Court and look forward to arguing the case.”

Scavino and Navarro are among the latest in high-profile Trump White House officials facing repercussions for refusing to comply with the Jan. 6 committee’s subpoenas. Last year, former Trump adviser Stephen K. Bannon was indicted on charges of contempt of Congress, which prompted warnings from some Republicans of “payback” that they could do the same to Democrats if they retake control of the House majority in November.

Mark Meadows, a former chief of staff in the Trump White House, also refused to cooperate with the committee, leading to the House voting to hold him in contempt of Congress as well in December.

The Jan. 6 committee’s legal battles in its effort to subpoena records that would help committee members investigate the insurrection have not been limited to individuals. Earlier this month, the Republican National Committee filed a lawsuit against the Jan. 6 committee seeking to block the panel’s subpoena of data from Salesforce, an RNC software vendor.

In its subpoena of Salesforce, the Jan. 6 committee said it needed performance metrics and analytics related to Trump’s campaign to investigate if Trump and the RNC used the software vendor’s platform to disseminate false statements about the 2020 election, citing evidence that many rioters were motivated by those false claims. The RNC’s lawsuit argued that the request went beyond the scope of the congressional committee’s subpoena power.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/24/jan-6-committee-trump-navarro-scavino-contempt-congress/,2022-03-24
The Washington Post,Former guerrilla member running for president of Colombia envisions new Latin American left,C,"MEDELLÍN, Colombia — Even before the pandemic, Jimy Alejandro Carmona was going hungry.

Having left school after the sixth grade, the young man found occasional work cleaning up trash on the streets of his neighborhood overlooking Colombia’s second-biggest city. But it was barely enough to feed his mother, his sister and himself and pay their $117 rent. Some days — many days, during the peak of the country’s coronavirus crisis — they hardly ate anything.

His desperation led him to join the thousands of Colombians last year who protested a government they said had made life even harder for the poor in one of the most unequal countries in the world. That desperation had now led him to a metro station in Medellín to hand out campaign newspapers for a man he says could lift him out of hopelessness: Gustavo Petro, a former guerrilla member-turned-politician who has his best chance yet of becoming the first leftist president in Colombia’s history.

At the very least, Carmona would make $9 a day in the process.

As Colombians prepare to vote in the presidential election in May, scores of young, struggling people are backing Petro, a former mayor of Bogotá and third-time presidential candidate. The 61-year-old senator, who was a member of the 19th of April Movement, or M-19, in the 1980s, gained more than twice as many votes in this month’s primary elections as the leader of the right-wing coalition and six times as many as the leading centrist candidate.

Governments are shifting to the left across Latin America, a region hit hard by the pandemic’s economic assault, where widening inequality is fueling discontent. Chile this month swore in 36-year-old former student activist Gabriel Boric as president, following wins by leftist candidates in Bolivia, Peru and Honduras. Former Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is the favorite to win the October election in Latin America’s largest country.

Petro told The Washington Post he envisions a progressive “axis” between Chile, Colombia and Brazil. He said he aims to usher in a new Latin American left, built not on extracting natural resources like governments past but on protecting the environment and advancing industrialization.

“We will propose to Latin America a new path,” Petro said.

That path, if Petro were to win, would include ending new oil exploration to move the country toward renewable energy. It would mean boosting the local agriculture industry by renegotiating trade agreements with the United States. It would mean taxing the 4,000 wealthiest Colombians. On Wednesday, he announced that Francia Márquez, an Afro Colombian human rights and environmental activist, would be his running mate.

In a country that has never been led by a true leftist, Petro’s lead in the polls is generating panic elsewhere on the political spectrum. A phenomenon known as the “Petro clause” has appeared in contracts, stating they’ll take effect only if he loses.

Petro has been careful to distance himself from the socialist governments of Cuba and Venezuela, but conservatives fear the relationships he might build with their leaders. He told The Post that better relations with the government of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro would help the countries revive trade and regain control of a border taken over by drug trafficking groups.

In the May vote, he’ll probably face the most opposition here, in the traditionally conservative department of Antioquia, the cradle of the country’s right-wing parties and the birthplace of former president Álvaro Uribe, one of the country’s most powerful and polarizing politicians. The two key candidates competing against Petro are both former mayors of Medellín: the conservative Federico Gutiérrez, 47, and the centrist Sergio Fajardo, 65. Petro won twice as many primary votes as Fajardo in his own department, but Gutiérrez was the clear winner in Antioquia, bringing in three times as many votes as Petro.

Still, Petro’s young campaign volunteers here are convinced the city is changing. Four years ago, the second time Petro ran for president, he hardly campaigned in Antioquia. This time, his rallies have packed public plazas across the department.

Carmona, at the metro station, wrapped the Colombian flag around his back as he handed a woman a campaign newspaper with Petro’s face on the cover.

“If Antioquia changes,” the headline read, “Colombia changes.”

Changing the system

Each time Petro has run for president, his candidacy has galvanized an opposition fearful he’d turn Colombia into Venezuela. But the prospect of “Castro-Chavismo” is no longer as powerful a boogeyman for Colombians, Sergio Guzmán said.

“People are so fed up with the status quo that becoming Venezuela is not what frightens them the most,” said Guzmán, director of the consulting firm Colombia Risk Analysis. “What frightens them the most is staying the way we are.”

For the first time in nearly two decades, Uribe is no longer seen as strong enough to sway an election. The security hard-liner is celebrated for his hardhanded approach against armed rebel groups and despised for presiding over repeated alleged human rights violations. But he is now best-known for handpicking the deeply unpopular current president, Iván Duque, who critics say has done little to improve the country’s security or economic well-being.

About 1.6 million Colombians fell out of the middle class during the pandemic. Violence in many parts of the country has increased, as have the killings of social leaders and environmental activists. Frustration over a proposed tax revision and broader discontent over inequality fueled months of protests last year. In a recent Ipsos survey, 84 percent of Colombians said their country was moving in the wrong direction, the second-highest rate among 28 countries surveyed.

Petro’s crowd-rousing speeches have often focused on what he says many of these problems come down to: hunger.

“Decreasing hunger requires change, change to an economic system that has reached its end,” Petro told a large crowd in Medellín this month. “Change to a social system that has produced a society that is profoundly unjust.”

What would it take to change the system? The primaries brought big wins for Petro’s leftist coalition in Congress, but not enough to win a majority. Petro would have to work with a divided legislature to pass his agenda. But he’s already announced he would declare an economic state of emergency to combat hunger if elected, a proposal criticized by some constitutional law experts.

“This proposal is part of a tendency of a certain Latin American left that the only way to make profound social changes is through a strong president who does not agree or seek consensus with political forces through Congress, but uses mechanisms of executive orders instead,” said law professor Rodrigo Uprimny, who sat temporarily on the country’s constitutional court.

Some U.S. critics worry a Petro presidency would strain relations with Washington. The candidate has suggested changing the extradition treaty between the two countries. A former U.S. official in Colombia said a Petro victory could complicate the long-running partnership in combating drug trafficking.

Petro argues that counterdrug policies over the last several decades have been a failure and that aerial eradication of coca has done nothing to reduce the flow of cocaine to the United States. He would focus instead on crop substitution.

“The main concern is whether he’s committed to work within the system to promote change,” said Michael Shifter, president of the D.C.-based Inter-American Dialogue, “or whether he’s willing to destroy the system.”

If no candidate wins a majority in May, the two top will go to a runoff in June. Petro and his rivals have alleged voting fraud in the country’s electoral system. On Monday, Petro announced he would no longer participate in debates until “voting transparency” is guaranteed.

Resistance builds

Carmona was agitated as he arrived at the metro station. He had been passing out Petro’s newspapers on a street nearby, he said, when a police officer called him a “guerrilla fighter.”

Fellow campaign worker Valentina Álvarez saw just how much opposition Petro would have to overcome to win over Medellín voters. She’d been insulted, sworn at, approached by a man who yelled in her ear: “I’m not voting for him.”

A man to whom she tried to pass a newspaper made the sign of the cross and kept walking. One woman said, “I’ll take one because it’s your job” and then tossed it in the trash.

Across Medellín and Colombia, an anti-Petro resistance is once again gaining force. Conservative politicians and the traditional establishment are rallying behind Gutiérrez. Several civic groups in Antioquia have organized “to help citizens understand the importance of Colombia’s economic model,” according to a Medellín business executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss political matters.

“If Petro comes to power, he’s going to install communism in the country,” the executive said.

Petro called such claims “unfounded.”

“It’s logical, because Colombia has had such a democratic deficit that only a few families have governed for two centuries,” he said. “When the possibility arises that this history will change … it scares them because they see it as abnormal, when it should be normal in any democratic country on earth.”

He added: “Any entrepreneur should not be afraid of a government program that seeks to increase national production.”

Gutiérrez has frequently criticized Petro’s “populist projects.” He recently blasted a Petro proposal to use pensions to fund social programs, calling it “dangerous.”

“He wants to spend money that does not belong to him and wants to expropriate it, just as he wants to do with lands and private property,” Gutiérrez said. Petro has denied the accusation.

Petro has begun creating alliances with people who might seem counterintuitive, such as a Christian leader with thousands of followers on the Caribbean coast. But he’s drawn criticism from liberals for ties to a conservative former Medellín mayor and a local politician accused of domestic violence.

Aides from his time as mayor of Bogotá have accused him of refusing to listen to advisers and displaying authoritarian tendencies.

“The way he does politics, his alliances, his decisions, not opposing gender-based violence … those types of things lose him points,” said Sara Tufano, a feminist and sociologist who once campaigned for him. “He’s not an easy person to work with. He’s not a conciliatory person.”

Petro called such criticism “fake news.”

Carmona has a tattoo on his right arm of a crown. Below it is the name “Sandra,” his mother.

The day before, he said, “she didn’t have a bite to eat all day long.” He wept.

“We’re tired of being robbed. We’re tired of putting up with hunger. We’re tired of walking around looking for jobs and not finding any,” Carmona said. “Where are the opportunities? I don’t see any.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/03/24/colombia-election-gustavo-petro/,2022-03-24
The Washington Post,"Dubai ruler denied custody of kids, as U.K. court deems him bad dad",C,"LONDON — He is one of the richest real estate moguls in the world, the prime minister of the United Arab Emirates and the ruler of the emirate of Dubai, the flashy party town and jet-setter hub in the Middle East. And, according to British courts, he’s a seriously bad dad.

A British family judge ruled Thursday that Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum inflicted domestic abuse on an “exorbitant scale” against then-wife Princess Haya, awarding her sole custody of the couple’s two children.

In a written judgment, the senior family court judge, Andrew McFarlane, stated that Mohammed had “consistently displayed coercive and controlling behaviour with respect to those members of his family who he regards as behaving contrary to his will.”

Mohammed is a close ally of both Britain and the United States.

The two-year legal battle — the divorce, financial settlement and custody fight — cast an unflattering light on the lavish lifestyles and jaw-dropping spending of Dubai’s ruling family, as well as the extent of Mohammed’s attempt to control his ex-wife, including the use of Israeli spyware.

The case began with Haya, the 47-year-old daughter of the late King Hussein of Jordan and Mohammed’s sixth and youngest wife. She said she feared for her life.

The princess first escaped to Germany, then London in 2019, with the couple’s children: son Zayed, now 10, and daughter al-Jalila, now 14.

In December, a British judge awarded Haya a record-breaking settlement — in excess of $720 million — in her custody battle.

In addition to payments for 24/7 security, the court awarded Haya millions to cover the costs of the upkeep of her two homes, near Kensington Palace in London and in the suburban town of Egham in Surrey, as well as vacations, clothes and salaries for staff.

The costs were diligently itemized — $500,000 for food during vacations; $368,000 to maintain three horses and other pets for the children; $51,000 to replace two Somersault sunken trampolines the family had owned at its palace in Dubai.

Last year, the court heard that Mohammed had allegedly sought to buy a home near Haya’s and issued threats, including a text message that said, “We can find you anywhere.”

Earlier in the proceedings, the court revealed that the ruler of Dubai used the Israeli NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware to hack the phones of his estranged wife and members of her inner circle.

In Thursday’s ruling on child custody, McFarlane noted Mohammed’s failure to appear in court and his “absence of any acceptance of responsibility, expression of remorse or understanding of the impact of this behaviour on the mother.”

Going forward, the judge said, the father will be limited to “indirect contact” with his children, allowed to see them through the phone but not in person.

Haya, in a statement, said, “The last few years have been a frightening journey and yet the sanctuary, protection and extraordinary compassion we have experienced in England have strengthened our belief in the enduring power of both humanity and justice.”

Mohammed’s representatives told the Guardian newspaper: “He loves his children and cherishes their love for him. He has always cared and provided for them, and always will. He maintains his denial of the allegations made in these contentious proceedings.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/03/24/dubai-mohammed-prince-court-uk/,2022-03-24
The Washington Post,New Zealand to take in hundreds of asylum seekers held in detention,C,"Australia has accepted a nearly decade-old offer that would allow New Zealand to resettle hundreds of asylum seekers that Australia has held at offshore processing centers on the island nation of Nauru — a policy that has come under criticism from human rights groups.

Since 2013, Australia has redirected people arriving by boat without visas to the detention camps on Nauru, a Pacific island nation around 2,000 miles from Australia’s shores, or Manus Island in Papua New Guinea. Australia also maintains a policy that prevents arrivals from ever resettling in Australia.

The same year, New Zealand’s then-Prime Minister John Key offered to take in 150 of the detainees for three years. Since then, Kiwi leaders have reiterated the offer, including Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern: “We remain ready and willing to help,” Ardern’s office said in 2018.

Australia has rebuffed the offer, saying that maintaining its hard-line immigration stance is a deterrent for future undocumented, and dangerous, sea journeys. The Aussies have also voiced concern that refugees brought to New Zealand would travel back to Australia for permanent settlement.

New Zealand Immigration Minister Kris Faafoi in a Thursday statement said he was “pleased that Australia has taken up the offer,” and glad that New Zealand is able to provide “resettlement outcomes for refugees who would otherwise have continued to face uncertain futures.”

Even as Australia accepted the new policy, Australian officials reiterated their strong border policies.

“This arrangement does not apply to anyone who attempts an illegal maritime journey to Australia in the future. Australia remains firm — illegal maritime arrivals will not settle here permanently. Anyone who attempts to breach our borders will be turned back or sent to Nauru,” Australian Minister for Home Affairs Karen Andrews said in a statement.

The Australia-run offshore processing centers have been controversial. Human rights groups said they constitute an international law violation and have denounced the centers’ conditions. Human Rights Watch in 2016 said refugees on Nauru suffer neglect and inhumane treatment — and even said the “government’s failure to address serious abuses appears to be a deliberate policy to deter further asylum seekers.”

Around 112 refugees remain in Nauru and 105 in Papua New Guinea, according to the Refugee Council of Australia. Its data shows that 3,127 people have been sent offshore since July 2013 — with around 1,100 brought to Australia for temporary purposes and 993 settled in the United States. Australia announced in October that it would end its detention deal with Papua New Guinea, though its arrangement with Nauru would remain.

Rights groups have sounded the alarm of a mental health crisis on Nauru. The Refugee Council of Australia said that experts described people transferred to Nauru as “among the most traumatized they have seen,” and Doctors Without Borders has also reported widespread severe mental health conditions, including self-harm and attempted suicide.

One 23-year-old Iranian refugee set himself on fire in protest of conditions in Nauru in 2016, in front of three Canberra-based United Nations refugee agency officials. He died in a hospital two days after, and his partner has sued the Australian government for negligence. The same week, on the same island, a 21-year-old Somali asylum seeker set fire to herself.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/03/24/nauru-new-zealand-australia-refugee-offshore/,2022-03-24
The Washington Post,Supreme Court says official’s First Amendment rights not violated by censure,C,"The proper response for elected officials censured by their colleagues for their public criticism is not to sue but to keep criticizing, the Supreme Court decided Thursday.

The court unanimously threw out a lawsuit by a member of a community college board in Texas who said the formal reprimand he received from his colleagues was the kind of retaliatory action by a government body that the First Amendment forbids.

But Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, writing for himself and his eight colleagues, said members of Houston Community College’s Board of Trustees were within their rights to censure member David Wilson, just as he had the right to criticize their past actions.

“In this country, we expect elected representatives to shoulder a degree of criticism about their public service from their constituents and their peers — and to continue exercising their free speech rights when the criticism comes,” Gorsuch wrote.

He added: “The First Amendment surely promises an elected representative like Mr. Wilson the right to speak freely on questions of government policy. But just as surely, it cannot be used as a weapon to silence other representatives seeking to do the same.”

Wilson was more than just a vocal critic of his colleagues; he regularly accused fellow board members of corruption and, at one point, hired a private investigator to determine whether one lived in the proper district. The board in 2018 formally censured him for behavior “not only inappropriate, but reprehensible.”

Wilson sued, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit said the lawsuit could continue. Although there were other punishments involved, the Supreme Court took the case to decide the relatively narrow issue of whether a verbal censure amounted to retaliation forbidden by the First Amendment.

“As it comes to us, too, the censure did not prevent Mr. Wilson from doing his job, it did not deny him any privilege of office, and Mr. Wilson does not allege it was defamatory,” Gorsuch wrote. “At least in these circumstances, we do not see how the Board’s censure could have materially deterred an elected official like Mr. Wilson from exercising his own right to speak.”

Gorsuch said that Congress has been censuring members since the 19th century and that “elected bodies in this country issued no fewer than 20 censures in August 2020 alone.”

Gorsuch said that didn’t mean all censures are alike, and that such condemnation sometimes might not be acceptable, depending upon the recipient.

“It may be, for example, that government officials who reprimand or censure students, employees, or licensees may in some circumstances materially impair First Amendment freedoms,” he wrote. Or “when the government interacts with private individuals as sovereign, employer, educator, or licensor, its threat of a censure could raise First Amendment questions.”

But in cases in which the combatants are equal members of an elected board, “argument and counterargument” are the acceptable weapons for disputes, not litigation, Gorsuch wrote.

The Washington Post,FBI warns of online ‘sextortion’ cases targeting teens,C,"FBI officials issued a warning Thursday following an increase in “sextortion” reports of teenage boys being targeted online by scam artists who entice them to share explicit content and then later extort money from the victims, officials said.

Authorities say scammers pose as young girls online via social media platforms and convince victims to produce sexual images and videos, according to statements released by the federal investigators. The victims typically range from 14 to 17 years old.

In other instances, victims are encouraged to engage in explicit activity over video and the scammer secretly records the acts, FBI officials said. The scammers later attempt to extort money from victims by threatening to post the content online.

Scammers ask for payment via cash apps and even with gift cards, said Special Agent Barbara Smith, who supervises the child exploitation and human trafficking task force at the FBI Washington Field Office. But even after some victims pay, the victims continue to be extorted.

Smith said similar extortion schemes targeting men and boys have operated for years. But in the past six months, reports to the FBI out of the District and Northern Virginia increased from one report a month to two or three each week, she said in an interview Thursday.

“This has been going on for several years; what’s new is the frequency, and more children are falling victim to this scam,” Smith said. These financially motivated sextortion schemes that capture children are actually overshadowing the traditional child predator sextortion schemes that they have.”

Investigators say the suspected scammers are abroad and offenders may have hundreds of victims worldwide.

“We recognize victims may feel embarrassed and thus hesitant to come forward and report these incidents,” said Wayne Jacobs, special agent in charge of the Washington Field Office’s criminal/cyber division. “The most effective way to disrupt these criminals is through awareness, education, and having important discussions with your children about their online safety.”

Smith’s task force is involved because juveniles are producing pornographic images that can later be spread through underground networks across the Internet.

Victims are being asked to come forward so agents can upload the illegal images to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children database to track them in case they appear in other investigations, Smith said.

Agency officials suggest parents limit who has access to social media accounts; block or ignore messages from strangers online; and to be suspicious of people their children meet in an online game or app and ask to start talking to them on a different platform.

Parents should encourage children to report suspicious behavior to adults, FBI officials said.

“This is very traumatic for many high school, middle school-aged students, and we want to make sure they are getting the victims’ services they need,” Smith said.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/03/24/fbi-warns-online-sextortion-scams-target-teens/,2022-03-24
The Washington Post,"Parkland shooting survivors return to D.C., with a grim message",C,"Jaclyn Corin, a survivor of the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., hopes lawmakers looked out the U.S. Capitol windows on Thursday and saw a grim representation of their failures.

On the National Mall on Thursday morning, activists used more than 1,100 body bags to spell out “Thoughts and prayers,” a condolence often invoked after mass shootings — and one that gun-violence-prevention activists decry as hollow, as more people continue to die.

“This is still happening, and we need to step back into this to keep pushing and coercing our president and Congress to do something,” said Corin, 21, a co-founder of March for Our Lives and a government major at Harvard University. “If they continue to pursue a pathway of inaction, only more people are going to die.”

In the wake of the Parkland shooting, in which the attacker fatally shot 14 fellow students and three staff members, the survivors and other teenagers sparked a political movement demanding an end to school shootings and everyday gun violence. Four years ago Thursday, Corin and other survivors led hundreds of thousands of demonstrators in the District and across the country in protests to demand action. But the handful of activists gathered on the Mall on Thursday offered a much starker message.

Under gray skies, survivors of the Parkland shooting and others who had lost family and friends to shootings said they worked to elect President Biden and members of Congress who promised to act but did not. Surrounded by the body bags — bags stuffed with inflatable balloons that made them seem all too real — they said they were four years older and frustrated. While Democrats took the White House, Senate and House in 2020, no federal gun-control legislation has been passed.

“I want this moment to act as a reminder of how angry and passionate we all felt back then,” Corin said. “The march in 2018 brought together so many people in this country in one collective mission to save lives.”

Since the Parkland shooting, more than 170,000 people in the United States have died from guns, organizers said, citing Gun Violence Archive data. Each body bag in the installation on the Mall represents more than 150 deaths.

Corin and others are calling on Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) to bring universal background checks to the Senate floor for a vote and are asking supporters to sign a petition, with a goal of 1.2 million signatures. A substantial majority of Americans — 89 percent — support requiring background checks for all gun buyers, according to an April 2021 Quinnipiac University poll. In response to a query from The Post, Schumer’s office pointed to his February comment to a reporter that he believes “very, very strongly” in continuing to pursue such legislation.

Still, Corin called such a step the “bare minimum” and emphasized that the group is also asking Biden to do more to combat gun violence.

David Hogg, a Parkland survivor and a 21-year-old Harvard University student, said those who care about gun violence should be ready to mount primary challenges against elected officials who have not worked for change. Politicians who say they support gun-control measures who do nothing, Hogg said, are worse than gun rights supporters, who are clear about where they stand: “At least the NRA doesn’t lie.”

Trevon Bosley, 23, said he lost a brother and a cousin to shootings in Chicago in the mid-aughts. Though he’s been active in the anti-gun-violence movement since then, he said the crisis has only worsened.

“We don’t care about thoughts and prayers,” he said. “I wake up and listen to sirens. You asked us to vote for you, and we did. We are not seeing the fruits of our labor.”

Last month, on the four-year anniversary of the school shooting, Manuel Oliver, father of Parkland shooting victim Joaquin Oliver, balanced on a construction crane near the White House, demanding a meeting with Biden and policies to combat gun violence. While he was 150 feet in the air, he unfurled a sign with a photo of his late son’s face.

Oliver and his wife, Patricia Oliver, were hoping to bring attention to the initiative they launched with March for Our Lives and Guns Down America called Shock Market, which tracks gun violence since Biden’s inauguration.

On Thursday, Oliver said politicians shouldn’t expect support from survivors if they haven’t delivered results.

“Do they think we’re going to do the same thing we did a couple of years ago?” he said. “We’re not making that mistake again.”

The administration did not respond to a request for comment Thursday but previously pointed to actions the president has taken or attempted to take in the past year. The White House has claimed meaningful successes, including the hundreds of millions of dollars in stimulus funding that, at the administration’s urging, states and cities are using to address gun violence at the local level.

During the 2018 March for Our Lives, speakers did not focus just on mass shootings at suburban, White schools. They also emphasized the experiences of the far more common shootings that leave one or two young people dead and often affect predominantly Black and Hispanic students in poor neighborhoods.

Since Parkland, at least 89,000 students have been exposed to gun violence on K-12 campuses during regular hours, according to a database from The Washington Post. In 105 shootings between February 2018 and the end of January, 28 people were killed and 90 were wounded. There were 42 school shootings in 2021 alone — more than in any other year since at least 1999 — despite ongoing closures of many schools during the pandemic.

In D.C. and Maryland suburbs, homicides soared in 2021 to levels not seen in more than a decade, largely driven by firearms.

In Montgomery County, which approached a number of killings not seen in at least 46 years, Police Chief Marcus Jones said he has “never seen the amount of guns and gun activity that is currently on our streets.” Christopher Geldart, the District’s deputy mayor for public safety and justice, told residents at an October meeting on Capitol Hill that there is “a gun crisis in the city.”

Four years ago, students from Parkland and the D.C. region turned their pain into inspiration, believing they could persuade adults to enact legislation that protects future generations from gun violence.

But in the absence of change, Daud Mumin, a 20-year-old from Salt Lake City who’s co-chair of the board of directors for March for Our Lives, said the body bags on the Mall reflect a “very dark reality.”

“Both nationally and in D.C., we’d love the conversation to be a reckoning of the past four years,” said Mumin, who graduated from Westminster College in December with a degree in justice studies. “We’re putting pressure on Congress, we’re putting pressure on the president, and we’re urging people to join this movement and to join in putting pressure on their respective politicians and legislators to really take this issue seriously.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/03/24/parkland-protest-dc-gun-violence/,2022-03-24
The Washington Post,Spring to pause in eastern U.S. as significant cold spell arrives,C,"Balmy weather has prevailed over much of the eastern United States during March, but the month’s final weekend promises a return of more wintry conditions. The lion and lamb seem to have traded places.

Temperatures this weekend into early next week are to expected plummet 10 to 20 degrees below normal over much of the eastern third of the nation. Snow is expected in the higher mountains of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, as well as downwind of the Great Lakes. Along the Interstate 95 corridor, low temperatures will plunge below freezing.

Milder weather will try to return by the middle of next week, but, on balance, chillier-than-average weather may hang around for the next seven to 10 days or so.

How cold and when?
Chilly air will begin spilling into the eastern United States on Friday, but the core of the cold arrives over the weekend and lasts through early next week. That’s when temperatures will generally be about 10 to 20 degrees below seasonal norms. In some areas on Monday, the departures from normal could be as much as 30 degrees.

These departures translate to the following temperatures in these cities:

Chicago: Highs near 40 Saturday through Monday, with lows in the 20s.
Cincinnati: Highs 40 to 45 Saturday through Monday, with lows in the 20s.
Nashville: Highs in the mid-to-upper 50s Friday through Sunday, with lows in the 30s.
Raleigh: Highs in the mid-to-upper 50s Saturday through Monday, with lows in the 30s.
Washington: Highs near 55 on Saturday, 45 to 50 Sunday, and near 45 Monday. Lows near 30 Sunday and Monday (20s in suburbs).
Buffalo: Highs near 35 Sunday and 25 to 30 on Monday. Lows near 20 Sunday through Tuesday. Some accumulating snow is possible Sunday.
New York: Highs 45 to 50 Sunday and 35 to 40 on Monday. Lows 25 to 30 Monday and Tuesday.
Boston: Highs near 50 Sunday, near 35 Monday and near 40 Tuesday. Lows in the 20s Monday and Tuesday.
These temperatures are much more typical of late February or early March, rather than late March.

On Sunday and Monday, the Upper Midwest, Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, most of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast will all endure freezing early-morning temperatures. In Washington, these temperatures will probably end the peak bloom of the cherry blossoms.

Gusty winds will intensify the cold. Forecast wind chills on Monday morning dip into the teens in the northern Mid-Atlantic and single digits in much of the interior Northeast. Subzero wind chills are even possible in the mountains.

Where snow is possible
A vigorous high-altitude disturbance will drop from the Upper Midwest on Friday into the northern Mid-Atlantic on Saturday. It will generate periods of snow in the central and northern Appalachian Mountains and also enhance lake-effect snow bands downwind of the Great Lakes on Friday night and Saturday.

Even at lower elevations, ice pellets or graupel could mix with rain showers, including along the I-95 corridor from Washington to Boston on Saturday afternoon.

As a second disturbance passes through the Northeast on Sunday, more snow showers are possible downwind of the Great Lakes and on the westward facing slopes (upslope areas) of the Appalachians.

At least several inches of snow could fall downwind lakes Erie and Ontario, as well as in the high elevations of the Appalachians. Amounts will tend to increase with elevation.

The cause of the cold pattern
Weather systems are favorably configuring themselves for this wintry pattern. Significantly, a blocking zone of high pressure is setting up over Greenland. That’s forcing the jet stream, which divides cold air and warm air, to dive south over eastern North America. This is reflected by the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). When the NAO is negative, the weather over the eastern U.S. tends to be colder than normal.

Such a pattern was seldom seen during the core winter months, which resulted in generally above-normal temperatures.

Weather models show this negative NAO pattern persisting for a week to 10 days, although it will probably be strongest through early next week. As it weakens after that, forecast models simulate more variable temperatures in the eastern United States.

While the East shivers amid this pattern, the West will simmer. Temperatures are forecast to be 10 to 30 degrees above normal from the western Plains to the Pacific Coast Saturday through Monday.

Record highs in the 80s and 90s are forecast over interior California and southern Arizona on Friday. Over the weekend, record highs well into the 70s are predicted to spread through Nevada and southern Idaho on Saturday to parts of Wyoming and Colorado on Sunday, including Denver.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2022/03/24/spring-pause-eastern-us-snow/,2022-03-24
The Washington Post,Alex Jones said he was too sick for a deposition — then taped his show,C,"Alex Jones’s lawyers told a judge on Tuesday that the Infowars founder was too sick to answer questions under oath at his court-ordered deposition the next day.

Their arguments were similar to those they had made the day before in a written motion requesting a postponement in the court case in which relatives of those killed in the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School sued him for calling the massacre a “giant hoax.” A delay was necessary, they said, because a doctor “remains firm in his initial recommendation that Mr. Jones neither attend a deposition nor return to work” since he “stands at serious risk of harm.”

But Jones was at work right around the time they were making those very arguments to the judge, they later conceded. Specifically, he was at his recording studio in Austin in the middle of broadcasting four hours of “The Alex Jones Show.” Just as his lawyers were about to argue he was too sick to testify, Jones warned listeners that a cabal of global elites plan to start a nuclear war or otherwise trigger a global crisis in the coming months to cover up massive financial crimes they’ve committed over the decades.

Connecticut state Judge Barbara Bellis denied the motion for a postponement. But Jones didn’t show for the deposition scheduled Wednesday. Bellis has now ordered Jones to appear Thursday to give sworn testimony. Opposing lawyers requested the judge issue a warrant for Jones’s arrest if he fails to show again.

Jones’s lawyers and Infowars did not respond Wednesday night to a request for comment from The Washington Post.

Jones is being sued by multiple families whose relatives died in the mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. For years, Sandy Hook families have said Jones was grifting off claims that the shooting — in which 20 children and six school staffers were killed — was a “false flag” operation staged by “crisis actors.” During a 2019 deposition, he renounced those statements and admitted the shooting had happened, blaming his previous false claims on “a form of psychosis.”

“I talk four hours a day, and I can’t remember what I talked about sometimes a week ago,” Jones said during that deposition.

In 2018, several of them sued Jones for defamation in Texas and Connecticut. In November, after years of litigation, Judge Bellis ruled that Jones was liable by default in the Connecticut case after he and his companies refused to obey court orders to provide financial records and other documents, The Post reported.

Bellis said Jones and his companies engaged in “a pattern of obstructive conduct” that thwarted the normal court process and prevented the Sandy Hook families from pursing their case.

After the judge ruled against Jones, the case moved to a phase in which a jury will eventually decide how much Jones will have to pay in damages, which is why the deposition is still necessary.

Attorneys representing several Sandy Hook families said in filings that Jones was supposed to be deposed late last year, but the proceeding had been delayed several times. During a deposition, lawyers for the families would have the opportunity to ask Jones questions on the record under oath. His answers might later be used in a trial if the case doesn’t come to a settlement.

In requesting another postponement, one of Jones’s lawyers, Norman Pattis, said in a court filing Monday that he had received a phone call earlier that day about his client’s health. The caller, whom Pattis didn’t identify in his motion, told him that Jones was being cared for by a doctor for “medical conditions that require immediate, and possibly, emergency testing.” Pattis told the court he then spoke with someone claiming to be that doctor, who recommended Jones not go through with the deposition.

Jones asked his lawyer not to disclose his medical conditions or the identity of the doctor caring for him in the court record, Pattis said. His attorneys submitted earlier this week to the judge a letter that was supposedly from the doctor.

It didn’t sway her. In denying his motion, Bellis acknowledged that the health problems the doctor outlined were “potentially serious."" But, the judge continued, they weren’t serious enough for Jones to obey the doctor’s orders to stay home and rest, opting instead to keep broadcasting from his studio.

“Mr. Jones cannot unilaterally decide to continue to engage in his broadcasts, but refuse to participate in a deposition,” she wrote in her order denying his motion.

An attorney representing the Sandy Hook families suing Jones called the doctor’s note and the sickness claim “completely bogus.”

The “obvious gambit,” lawyer Christopher Mattei wrote in court documents, “represents yet another threadbare attempt to delay these proceedings and to shield Mr. Jones from an experience that puts him in peril — not because he is ill but because he will be under oath and bound to tell the truth.”

Mattei later denounced Jones’s bid for a delay as “a cowardly display intended to cheat the plaintiffs of their right to put him under oath and ask him questions,” Connecticut Public Radio reported.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/03/24/alex-jones-sandy-hook-deposition/,2022-03-24
The Washington Post,Russia trade bill stalls in Congress as senators quarrel over sanctions,C,"A bill that would add Russia and Belarus to a short list of pariah states that do not enjoy preferential U.S. trade status has stalled in the Senate as lawmakers spar over whether to attach other measures, such as a ban on Russian oil and gas imports.

The trade bill passed the House on a 424-to-8 vote last week, and Democrats are pushing to quickly pass it in the Senate so President Biden can sign it as he meets with key allies in Europe later this week to strategize further responses to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

“It is so important we show unity right now [as] President Biden meets with our European allies,” Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in floor remarks Wednesday. “Swift Senate action, combining Democrats and Republicans with one voice supporting [an end to Russia’s trade preferences] would do just that.”

But Sen. Mike Crapo (Idaho), the top Republican on the powerful Senate Finance Committee, objected to Schumer’s request to immediately pass the House bill — citing the other chamber’s decision to drop language on banning Russian energy imports that had previously been included in a handshake agreement between key congressional leaders.

“None of this is controversial, and all of it is necessary,” Crapo said Tuesday, calling the trade and energy bills “complementary.”

Both the trade sanctions and the energy import ban have already been the subject of executive action by Biden. But many in Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, have pushed for congressional action to codify Biden’s orders and show bipartisan comity in the quest to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin for his decision to invade Ukraine.

But accord has been hard to come by in recent months. After moments of talks, Democrats and Republicans could not come together on a Russia sanctions bill ahead of the late-February invasion — a package that some senators believed would show Western resolve and perhaps deter Putin from further action.

Since the invasion, lawmakers of both parties have pushed Biden to do more to deliver military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine and take a series of escalating steps to punish Russia. A $13.6 billion Ukrainian aid package was included in a vast spending bill that Biden signed into law earlier this month.

But bills to crack down on Russian trade, ban its energy imports, impose new restrictions on U.S. companies doing business in Russia, demand war-crimes investigations, transfer MiG jets and other materiel to Ukraine, and other measures have yet to reach Biden’s desk because of political and policy tussles.

A deal, however, appeared to be within reach Wednesday. After Schumer and Crapo sparred on the floor, the two men agreed to keep negotiating in hopes of sealing a deal to advance the trade and energy bills before the Senate finishes its business for the week on Thursday.

The energy import ban, like the trade bill, had broad bipartisan support in the House. But some senators, including Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Joe Manchin III (D-W-Va.), raised concerns about language in the House bill that would delay the ban for 45 days — potentially giving importers more time to arrange and settle transactions.

Crapo on Wednesday said he would agree to drop that provision to speed up action on the energy ban legislation, which he said would “demonstrate to the Ukrainian people and our NATO allies that Congress is committed to cutting off Russia’s funding for its war effort” and potentially persuade U.S. allies who are more dependent on Russian oil and gas to follow suit.

“I’m willing to make these concessions to get this done,” he said. “My view is that we should act quickly.”

But he warned that other senators could have requests of their own for additions or subtractions that could obstruct a deal. Passing the legislation this week would require the consent of all 100 senators.

One potential complication is that the House trade bill includes a permanent expansion of the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, a law that gives the U.S. government broad authority to impose sanctions on those found to have engaged in human rights abuses or serious acts of corruption.

A handful of House conservatives cited that provision — which expands applicability of the Magnitsky law from those engaging in “gross” human rights violations to merely “serious” violations — in opposing the legislation last week. One lawmaker, Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.), said the change could give a president the power to “threaten other countries to turn on their Christian heritage and change their laws to align with the views of the current White House.”

But Crapo said he supported its passage, and no senator has publicly objected. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) said Wednesday that allowing the Magnitsky Act, named after an anti-corruption crusader who died in a Russian prison, to expire would “send exactly the wrong message at the most critical time” and called for immediate passage of the extension.

“Look, there are burned bodies in the streets of Ukraine. There are mass graves to bury the dead. There are Ukrainians who are melting snow in order to drink water to survive. So it’s truly mind-boggling that we cannot get this legislation passed,” said Menendez.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/23/russia-trade-senate/,2022-03-23
The Washington Post,Metro outlines plan to gradually return suspended rail cars through summer,C,"Metro unveiled a plan Thursday that would gradually ease a train shortage through the summer, proposing a path to service beginning in May for its suspended rail cars as the transit agency records its highest ridership levels of the pandemic.

The plan outlines the eventual return of Metro’s 7000-series rail cars, which have been sidelined since a Blue Line train derailed in October. The transit agency said it is continuing to work toward a long-term solution to a five-month train shortage that has removed 60 percent of its fleet amid a federal safety investigation.

Metro’s proposal has been in the works for three months but offers no cause or solution for the mysterious defect that has plagued the wheels of nearly two dozen 7000-series cars, forcing all 748 out of service. The plan is Metro’s most detailed accounting yet of how the agency hopes to begin emerging from its biggest crisis in seven years, coming amid reduced public confidence and a pandemic that has battered its finances.

The tentative timeline for the return of increased rail service came during a Metro board meeting Thursday in which transit officials said the Silver Line extension to Loudoun County would be delayed until at least summer because of “nonnegotiable” construction issues. The 11-mile extension, built by the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, has faced numerous delays and originally was scheduled to be completed in July 2018.

Metro’s new proposal for boosting rail service doesn’t provide immediate service upgrades but relies on adding trains over several months to reduce wait times that are frustrating commuters. Metro had previously said the 7000 series would not return before April.

Faced with trains and stations becoming increasingly busy — as well as the task this year of opening the six-station Silver Line extension — Metrorail is hoping for quick approval from its regulatory agency for an automated wheel screening system to test, then reinstate, its 7000-series cars.

The safety commission suspended use of the cars until Metro could prove it solved the problem or could operate the trains safely. Metro experts and safety commission officials say cars can return safely if they are regularly monitored for the slightest signs of wheel movements. The defect’s slow progression allows for early detection long before it becomes significant enough to derail a train.

If Metro’s plan — which had not been submitted Thursday — wins the support of the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission, the transit agency would reduce Green and Yellow line waits to 15 minutes by May with an influx of older trains, while gradually phasing the 7000 series into service this summer. By the end of summer, transit officials said, the returning cars would help to reduce waits on the Blue, Orange and Silver lines to 15 minutes, with less time at stations served by multiple lines. Those wait times are comparable to off-peak frequencies before the pandemic.

“As Congressional and regional leaders have made clear, our ability to work together toward our common goal is crucial as our customers, businesses, employers, and governments are counting on us to get back to work and restore normalcy following the worst public health crisis in a generation,” Metro Board Chairman Paul C. Smedberg said in a letter laying out the plan to the safety commission.

The suspension of Metro’s most advanced and previously most reliable cars has challenged the agency at a time when ridership and revenue continue to suffer from the prevalence of telework. Still, demand is high among riders for frequent and reliable service as passengers seek social distancing onboard and the shorter wait times they were accustomed to before the pandemic.

Trains that had been running at 20 percent of pre-pandemic levels have recently been carrying more passengers, creating standing-room conditions during peak hours, partly because of the limited number of trains in the system. On Tuesday, Metrorail reported about 245,000 trips, the biggest daily total since the pandemic began and nearly 40 percent of early 2020 levels.

@wmata
On Tuesday, March 22, about 245,000 trips were taken on Metrorail, the highest ridership recorded since the pandemic began. Welcome back! 👋#wmata

Metro is the nation’s third-largest rail transit system, with a fleet of about 1,200 rail cars. The 7000-series cars, built by Kawasaki Rail, entered service in 2015 at a cost of about $2 million apiece.

Metro’s recent troubles began when a National Transportation Safety Board investigation into the derailment outside the Arlington Cemetery station revealed that wheels on one car had shifted two inches farther apart, causing them to slip from the track. Investigators ordered emergency inspections of the fleet and learned that a small number of cases had been found during routine inspections as early as 2017. Then, last year, occurrences of the flaw grew significantly.

In December, the safety commission lifted its suspension, allowing Metro to use the cars under a plan that would monitor the wheels for increased spacing or shifting through daily inspections.

But the commission reimposed the suspension about two weeks later, when inspectors learned that Metro was not following its plan. Metro also determined that hand-measuring the spacing between wheels daily was unfeasible.

Transit officials at the time said they would take three months to search for the cause of the malfunction while scouring the railroad industry for technology that could automate the measurements.

Metro General Manager Paul J. Wiedefeld said Thursday the cause of the defect continues to elude Metro’s engineers and experts, who suspect a mix of factors. Wiedefeld said Metro’s investigation is in a testing phase that includes re-creating operational conditions that might shed light on the flaw.

“As the cause appears to be a combination of factors, I do not expect a near-term solution,” he said.

With ridership, road congestion and gas prices rising, Wiedefeld said Metro’s immediate strategy to head off crowding on trains involves restoring 50 of its 6000-series cars, which are mostly unavailable since the model was taken out of service in November 2020 because of multiple train separations.

The transit system has rebuilt much of the “coupler” system, and it began slowly phasing in the cars in October. Wiedefeld said Metro hopes to have the 50 additional cars back in service by May, if the safety commission certifies them. The cars would provide an additional seven or eight six-car trains, on top of at least 50 that Metro has in service.

At the same time, Wiedefeld said, Metro will work toward getting the safety commission’s approval for a digital gauge to measure wheelsets that Metro plans to use along multiple automatic wayside inspection stations. The stations, which will be installed along the track in the coming weeks, take measurements as trains pass.

Metro plans to use both the automatic and manual measurement methods until it can slowly shift fully to the automatic measurements.

Smedberg on Thursday urged the safety commission to act quickly.

“We cannot wait until the end of these safety processes and protocols to get approvals,” he said. “We need timely decisions to be made as we go, or this will continue to drag on.”

Safety commission spokesman Max Smith said his agency is in daily contact with Metro, but added that the commission can’t act unless Metro submits a plan to operate the trains safely.

“[Metro] has not submitted a 7000 series return-to-service plan to us as required by and described in our order, so we do not have any specific action item,” he said. “We continue to work with them closely to make sure that they’re sharing information with us and that we can provide any feedback as soon as we can.”

Wiedefeld also told the board Thursday that because of continuing issues with construction of the Silver Line, he does not expect passenger service to begin on the line’s second phase until at least July.

While the transit agency had not set a date for when the extension would begin carrying passengers, earlier timelines laid out by the agency indicated service could begin in the first half of this year.

“This is critical to getting people out of cars as they head back to work to alleviate road congestion,” Smedberg said. “But it’s also very critical to the region’s economy.”

Thursday’s update from Metro was a stark contrast to the update offered to the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority Board at its meeting last week. Board members were told the Silver Line was continuing to move forward and that outstanding issues were being resolved.

MWAA officials said they continue to work closely with contractors to fix issues standing in the way of opening the rail line. In response to criticism of MWAA’s management of the project, authority spokesman David Mould noted the complexity of building the rail line.

“A project of this size and this importance is a very complicated thing,” he said. “A lot of issues are expected to come up. We believe that everyone is working well together. We believe we are making good progress toward the goal of providing a safe, reliable system.”

The delay is proving costly for the airports authority. Last week, project officials told the board it paid Capital Rail Constructors, the contactor responsible for building the rail line, an additional $4 million for its continued oversight of the line, which will continue until Metro is ready to move to the next phase in the project’s completion.

The issues Metro has raised include a lack of building occupancy certificates, missing certifications for a yard signal system and orange, boot-shaped cable connector assemblies that provide power for the rails.

“I know the board shares my extreme disappointment that we will not be cutting the ribbon together on the Silver Line this spring,” Wiedefeld said. “The reality is, we don’t control when the airport and their contractor finish their work. We don’t control that. So once they do that, once they’ve done their work, then we get in to do what we do.”

Fairfax County Board of Supervisors Chairman Jeffrey C. McKay (D-At Large) said delays have become commonplace for the project.

“I’m very frustrated by this latest setback,” he said in a text message. “While these new specific problems may fall on [the airports authority] and the contractor, at the end of the day, my frustration throughout these non-relenting delays is with all parties involved.”

Also Thursday, Maryland state Sen. Malcolm L. Augustine (D-Prince George’s) lodged a complaint with Metro’s board about Hitachi Rail’s process in choosing a Hagerstown site to build Metro’s 8000-series cars. The company announced last week it selected a 41-acre site for a 307,000-square-foot factory that will assemble 256 Metro cars starting in 2024. The $2.2 billion contract for the project, which includes an option for 800 more cars, included a stipulation that a plant be built in the Mid-Atlantic region.

Augustine, a former Metro board member, said the county was interested in the factory and asked Hitachi about the selection process twice last year, but did not get a reply. Augustine said a site within Metro’s service area would have created local jobs and increased cooperation and synchronicity between Metro and Hitachi.

“I have not heard back from Hitachi on this matter, but I felt it very important for me to bring this to your attention for immediate review and we will be doing the same from Annapolis,” he said.

In a statement Friday, Hitachi Rail officials did not say whether Prince George’s was considered for the factory. The company selected the Hagerstown site because of its proximity to Washington and other rail markets across the Northeast, the statement said. The company plans to use its Hagerstown factory to build cars and trams for other agencies after the Metro contract.

“We firmly believe our decision will benefit not only Washington County but the State of Maryland and the nation,” the statement said.

Metro board members also unanimously approved a $2.2 billion operating budget for fiscal year 2023, which begins July 1. The budget is funded with nearly $1.2 billion in subsidies from Maryland, Virginia and D.C., $375 million in revenue and $681 million in federal coronavirus relief money. The budget includes fare cuts and discounts intended to lure more riders, including $2 fares from 9:30 p.m. until close and discounts for weekly and monthly passes.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2022/03/24/dc-metro-return-ntsb-cars/,2022-03-24

""I want to express my profound sorrow. Slavery was abhorrent. And it should never have happened,"" William said at a state dinner hosted by Jamaica’s governor general and attended by local dignitaries and senior politicians.

""While the pain runs deep, Jamaica continues to forge its future with determination, courage and fortitude,"" William said in his remarks. ""I strongly agree with my father, the prince of Wales, who said in Barbados last year that the appalling atrocity of slavery forever stains our history.”

""The strength and shared sense of purpose of the Jamaican people, represented in your flag and motto, celebrate an invincible spirit,"" he continued. ""It is this same spirit that spurred on the Windrush generation, who came to the United Kingdom to help rebuild after the Second World War.

'PROFOUND SORROW': Britain's Prince William expresses “profound sorrow” over the “appalling atrocity of slavery” during a speech in Kingston, Jamaica. The country's PM has told the prince that he intends to cut ties with the monarchy. https://abcn.ws/37QBhux

William's speech came just hours after he and Kate met with Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness, who told them that while he was ""happy"" to welcome them to Jamaica, the country is on its way to becoming a republic.

Jamaica becoming a republic would mean removing Queen Elizabeth, William's grandmother, as its head of state.

Meeting the Prime Minister @AndrewHolnessJM and his wife here in Jamaica this morning 🇯🇲

As monarch, Queen Elizabeth is the head of the British Commonwealth, representing 54 nations, including Belize, Jamaica and the Bahamas, which William and Kate will visit next.

Another Caribbean country, Barbados, became a republic last year, no longer pledging allegiance to the queen.

William and Kate, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, are on a goodwill tour to Belize, Jamaica and the Bahamas to celebrate the queen's Platinum Jubilee, marking her 70 years on the throne.

The Cambridges were forced to cancel one of their first stops in Belize over the weekend when protests led by indigenous people broke out ahead of their arrival.

On Tuesday, the day of William and Kate's arrival in Jamaica, dozens of protesters gathered in Kingston to protest the visit.

A group known as the Advocates Network, which describes itself as a ""non-partisan alliance of individuals and organizations advocating for human rights and good governance,"" also published an open letter protesting the royals' visit, saying that British rule has ""perpetuated the greatest human rights tragedy in the history of humankind.""

Robert Nesta Morgan, who holds the position as minister without portfolio within Jamaica's government -- a spokesperson for Jamaica's government -- told ABC News that there is consensus within the country, and agreement between the Jamaican government and opposition leadership that the country is ""moving towards becoming a republic.""

""We already have political independence. We're an independent country,"" he said. ""But there is a symbolism as to who is the head of state that many persons, including inside and outside of government, wish to change.""

Prime Minister Holness appointed Marlene Malahoo Forte, the country's former attorney general, to be the minister of constitutional affairs, which took effect in January. Her new role, in part, oversees and advises the government as it seeks to transition to republic status.

Malahoo Forte told the Jamaica Observer in December that Holness gave her instructions for the constitution to be amended for the purposes of becoming a republic.

In addition to the calls for Jamaica to become a republic, activists have also been demanding slavery reparations in many of their demonstrations around William and Kate's visit.

William did not mention reparations in his remarks on slavery Wednesday.

In July, Jamaica announced plans to ask Britain for compensation for the Atlantic slave trade in the former British colony, according to Reuters, noting the total amount could be ""billions of pounds.""

Morgan told ABC News this week that people in Jamaica are looking for ""recognition of the damage"" done by slavery.

""The pursuit of reparations is not dependent on the acknowledgment of the oppressor that they have oppressed someone. It is based on the experience of those who are oppressed,"" he said. ""There are many persons in our society who have been fighting really hard for many decades for a recognition of not just the damage that slavery has done to our society, but also a recognition of the need to do repairing of that damage through reparations.""

William and Kate have so far not commented publicly on the controversy surrounding their visit.

While in Jamaica, the couple played soccer with locals and visited a teacher's college to talk about early childhood development, a particular focus of Kate's work.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge

But some New Yorkers who are still required to show proof of vaccination are calling foul on what they see as a double standard.

New York City Mayor Eric Adams announced Thursday that he was dropping the mandate that all city-based athletes and performers show proof of vaccination to take part in their game or event. Adams said his decision was based on the city's low COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations and the city's goal to restart its economy.

""We have to be on the field in order to win,"" Adams said during a news conference at Citi Field, where unvaccinated Mets players will no longer have to worry about not playing when the baseball season begins next month.

Until Thursday’s announcement, unvaccinated athletes could not play home games, because venues required everyone to be vaccinated for entry. Visiting players and entertainers, however, were exempt.

This affected the Brooklyn Nets after its star point guard, Kyrie Irving, repeatedly refused to get vaccinated.

Irving was listed inactive during the first three months of the season but was called up in January for road games. He scored 43 points in his last game Wednesday against the Memphis Grizzlies.

Adams said the old rules put teams and performers at a disadvantage.

""This is about putting New York City performers on a level playing field,"" Adams said.

Broadway performers represented by Actors Equity previously agreed to mandatory vaccinations.

""Broadway theatres anticipate no change in our protocols based on this announcement. We continue to evaluate our COVID safety protocols for audiences, cast and crew, in concert with our unions and medical experts,"" Charlotte St. Martin, the president of The Broadway League, said.

The mayor added that the decision will help the venues and employees who work in the arenas and entertainment venues and local businesses.

But not everyone was thrilled with the mayor's decision, particularly some unions representing city workers who are required to show proof of vaccination to work.

""There can’t be one system for the elite and another for the essential workers of our city. We stand ready to work out the details with the mayor, as we have been throughout this process,"" Harry Nespoli, president of the Uniformed Sanitationmen’s Association, said.

City Council Speaker Adrienne E. Adams also expressed concerns about the ""ambiguous messages"" sent to New Yorkers about vaccine requirements.

""This exemption sends the wrong message that higher-paid workers and celebrities are being valued as more important than our devoted civil servants, which I reject. This is a step away from following sensible public health-driven policies that prioritize equity,"" she said in a statement.

Earlier in the month, the mayor dropped the requirement for indoor businesses and venues, including movie theaters, to have their customers show proof of vaccination and wear a mask. He also dropped the mask mandate for schools and is set to drop the mask mandate for children 2- to 4-years old.

As of Thursday, 77.5% of all New Yorkers were fully vaccinated, and 36.3% of residents had received their booster dose, according to the city's Health Department.

The mayor and health department have repeatedly stressed that the COVID-19 vaccines are the most effective way of preventing hospitalizations and death caused by the virus and encouraged more New Yorkers to get their shots.",https://abcnews.go.com/Health/york-city-vaccine-mandate-rollback-prompts-concerns-double/story?id=83648663,2022-03-24
ABC News,Oscar-nominated film 'CODA' being adapted into stage musical from Deaf West Theatre,C,"Three-time Oscar nominee ""CODA"" is headed from the screen to the stage.

Vendôme Pictures and Pathé Films have teamed up with the Tony Award-winning Deaf West Theatre to develop the film, which is up for best picture at the 94th Academy Awards, into a musical.

DJ Kurs, the artistic director for Deaf West Theatre, said in a press release it's the organization's mission to ""be the artistic bridge between the Deaf and hearing communities"" and added that they're ""truly excited and honored to embark on this live iteration of a story that brings together both sides of the aisle and addresses the ways that we move throughout the world.""

The film follows the story of a 17-year-old girl named Ruby Rossi (Emilia Jones), who is a CODA (child of deaf adults) and the only hearing member of her family. Ruby's family -- father Frank (Troy Kotsur), mother Jackie (Marlee Matlin) and brother Leo (Daniel Durant) -- depend on her to communicate with others, especially when it comes to running their fishing business, but she has dreams of attending music school and becoming a singer.

""In the movie there is a scene where the Deaf members of the Rossi family, confronted with an inaccessible school performance, take in Ruby's song through the joy of others in the audience,"" Kurs said. ""This is an opportunity, then, to bring the story full circle by bringing it back to members of the Deaf community and by making the music accessible through our signed and sung live adaption of the movie.""

""CODA,"" which premiered at Sundance in January 2021 and was released by Apple TV+ in August 2021, is making history as the first film starring a predominantly deaf cast in leading roles to be nominated for the best picture Oscar.

ABC News,Full House' alum Dave Coulier opens up about sobriety,C,"""Full House"" alum Dave Coulier is opening up about how he cut alcohol out of his life.

""I was kind of the sad clown,"" the 62-year-old actor exclusively told ""Good Morning America"" on Friday. ""I had to really take an inner look at myself to see, OK, this is something that I need to change.""

Coulier shared a lengthy Instagram post the day prior in which he said, ""I was a drunk. Yes. An alcoholic."" He followed that up by sharing he's been sober since Jan. 1, 2020.

The comedian told ""GMA"" that admitting he was an alcoholic was ""hard"" because ""that was something that I thought other people were,"" but he realized his drinking was ""very, very thinly disguised as 'let's have a great time.'""

""I'm having the best time of my life. I feel healthier than I ever have,"" he said of how he feels today. ""You have to feel like you want to change and improve your life and let it come from the inside outward.""

Coulier's Instagram post included a photo of an injury he sustained to his face while he was drinking.

""When I drank, I was the life of the party. I could make people laugh until they fell down. In this picture I was the one who fell down,"" he recounted. ""Not because I was playing hockey or doing the things I love - like chopping wood or doing construction, golfing, fishing or flying airplanes. I was hammered and fell up some stairs made of stone.""

Coulier told ""GMA"" this photo signified the final straw that led to his decision to give up alcohol for good.

""That was pretty much it,"" he said. ""My wife was out of town, so I had to send her that picture and she started crying. And at that point I realized, wow, I need to fix this.""

Coulier said he loved having ""beers with the boys"" but eventually came to the realization that, as he put it in the Instagram caption, ""I loved booze, but it didn't love me back.""

""I decided to make a decision for my own well-being, my family and for those around me who I love so dearly,"" he said.

Coulier called out his wife of nearly eight years, Melissa, specifically for supporting his sobriety and staying by his side throughout the journey.

""The psychological and physical transformation has been amazing,"" he concluded. ""The sky is more blue, my heart is no longer closed, and I enjoy making people laugh until they fall down more than ever before.""

Sheena Greitens said when her mother confronted Eric Greitens about the incident, ""he told her that he did so to prevent [Sheena] from doing anything that might damage his political career,"" court documents obtained by ABC News said.

ABC News,Closing arguments set in Cowboys for Trump founder 1/6 trial,C,"WASHINGTON -- An elected official from New Mexico went to trial with a judge — not a jury — set to decide if he is guilty of charges that he illegally entered the U.S. Capitol grounds on the day a pro-Trump mob disrupted the certification of Joe Biden's presidential election victory.

U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden is scheduled to hear attorneys' closing arguments Tuesday for the case against Otero County Commissioner Couy Griffin, whose trial in Washington, D.C., is the second among the hundreds of people charged with federal crimes related to the Jan. 6, 2021, siege.

The judge heard testimony Monday from three government witnesses. Griffin's lawyer said he doesn't plan to call any defense witnesses.

The case against Griffin is unlike most of the Capitol riot prosecutions. He is one of the few riot defendants who isn't accused of entering the Capitol or engaging in any violent or destructive behavior. He claims he has been selectively prosecuted for his political views.

Griffin, one of three members of the Otero County Commission in southern New Mexico, is among a handful of riot defendants who either held public office or ran for a government leadership post in the 2 1/2 years before the attack.

He is among only three riot defendants who have asked for a bench trial, which means a judge will decide his case without a jury.

Griffin, a 48-year-old former rodeo rider and former pastor, helped found a political committee called Cowboys for Trump. He had vowed to arrive at the courthouse on horseback. Instead, he showed up Monday as a passenger in a pickup truck that had a horse trailer on the back.

Griffin is charged with two misdemeanors: entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds and disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds.

A key question in Griffin’s case is whether he entered a restricted area while Pence was still present on Capitol grounds, a prerequisite for the U.S. Secret Service to invoke access restrictions.

Griffin’s attorneys said in a court filing that Pence had already departed the restricted area before the earliest that Griffin could have entered it, but Secret Service inspector Lanelle Hawa testified that Pence never left the restricted area during the riot.

Hawa said agents took Pence from his office at the Capitol to a secure location at an underground loading dock on the Capitol complex. Pence remained in the loading dock location for four to five hours and never left the security perimeter before the joint session of Congress resumed on the night of Jan. 6, Hawa testified.

Defense attorney Nicholas Smith asked Hawa if it was Pence's decision to remain there for hours.

“I can't answer that,” she said.

Smith said prosecutors apparently believe Griffin engaged in disorderly conduct by peacefully leading a prayer on the Capitol steps.

“That is offensive and wrong,” Smith told the judge during his brief opening statements.

Prosecutors didn’t give any opening statements. Their first witness was Matthew Struck, who joined Griffin at the Capitol and served as his videographer. Struck has an immunity deal with prosecutors for his testimony.

After attending then-President Donald Trump’s “Stop the Steal” rally on Jan. 6, Griffin and Struck walked over barriers and up a staircase to enter a stage that was under construction on the Capitol’s Lower West Terrace for Biden’s inauguration, according to prosecutors.

Prosecutors played video clips that showed Griffin moving through the mob that formed outside the Capitol, where police used pepper spray to quell rioters.

“I love the smell of napalm in the air,” Griffin said in an apparent reference to a line by Robert Duvall's character in the war movie “Apocalypse Now.”

After climbing over a stone wall and entering a restricted area outside the Capitol, Griffin said, “This is our house … we should all be armed,” according to prosecutors. He called it “a great day for America” and added, “The people are showing that they have had enough,” prosecutors said.

Struck testified that he and Griffin went to the Capitol to find a place to pray. Smith asked Struck if anybody appeared to be “riled up” by the prayer that Griffin led.

“They started chanting, ‘Pray for Trump,’” Struck replied. “It looks like they’ve been calm and they’re listening to Couy.”

In a court filing, prosecutors called Griffin ""an inflammatory provocateur and fabulist who engages in racist invective and propounds baseless conspiracy theories, including that Communist China stole the 2020 Presidential Election.""

Griffin's attorneys say hundreds if not thousands of other people did exactly what Griffin did on Jan. 6 and haven't been charged with any crimes.

“The evidence will show that the government selected Griffin for prosecution based on the fact that he gave a speech and led a prayer at the Capitol, that is, selected him based on protected expression,” they wrote.

More than 770 people have been charged with federal crimes related to the Capitol riot. More than 230 riot defendants have pleaded guilty, mostly to misdemeanors, and at least 127 of them have been sentenced. Approximately 100 others have trial dates.

Earlier this month, a jury convicted a Texas man, Guy Wesley Reffitt, of storming the Capitol with a holstered handgun in the first trial for a Capitol riot defendant. Jurors also convicted him of obstructing Congress from certifying the Electoral College vote on Jan. 6, of interfering with police officers who were guarding the Capitol and of threatening his two teenage children if they reported him to law enforcement.

Reffitt's conviction on all charges could give prosecutors more leverage in negotiating plea deals in many other cases or discourage other defendants from going to trial. The outcome of Griffin's trial also could have a ripple effect, helping others to decide whether to let a judge or a jury decide their case.",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/capitol-riot-trial-opens-cowboys-trump-founder-83592184,2022-03-22
CNN,"Six high school-aged girls killed in a crash with semitruck had come to rolling stop, witnesses say",C,"The car driven by six high school-aged girls who died in a crash with a semitruck on Tuesday came to a “rolling stop” at a stop sign before entering the highway, witnesses said, according to an ongoing National Transportation Safety Board investigation, as the first victim was identified on Friday.

The girls were riding in a small passenger vehicle when it collided with a semitruck at an intersection in the city of Tishomingo, about 122 miles south of Oklahoma City.

On Friday, one of the victims was identified as 15-year-old Brooklyn Triplett. Brooklyn’s grandmother, Vada Triplett, confirmed her granddaughter’s death to CNN.

“Brooklyn was an amazing girl. She stood up for her beliefs and did not keep quiet when she felt someone was wronged.” Triplett told CNN. “She was so funny, witty and smart. Words can’t describe the wonderful light she had.”

There is a stop sign regulating traffic at the intersection where the crash occurred and the posted speed limit for the highway is 50 mph. Witnesses said the Chevy entered US-377 after making a “rolling stop” at the stop sign and was hit by the semitruck on the front-left, which pushed it off the roadway, according to the update.

The semitruck then veered off the road and came to stop in a private driveway off the highway. The driver of the truck was uninjured, the statement said.

The investigation is continuing and the NTSB, in coordination with the Oklahoma Highway Patrol, has sent a team of four investigators and a family assistance specialist to Oklahoma to look into several issues.

They will be evaluating highway conditions, like lighting and weather conditions, as well as accident histories at the site and potential reasons behind human error. They will also examine the vehicle’s compliance with federal and state regulations.

Investigators will reconstruct the crash events and analyze physical evidence and vehicle damage, the statement said.

The team’s on-scene work is expected to conclude by Monday and a preliminary report is expected late next month. The full investigation – which would include probable cause and any contributing factors – will be completed in the next year or two.​​

​”On behalf of our students, staff, families, and community I want to thank you for your thoughtfulness, prayers and encouragement,” said Bobby Waitman, Tishomingo Public Schools superintendent, in a statement.

CNN,Wife of Mark Meadows appears to have used invalid address on North Carolina voter forms,C," Debra Meadows, the wife of former congressman and Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows, signed voter forms attesting she resided at a Macon County, North Carolina, mobile home that reports indicate the couple never lived in.

On registration forms, both Debra and Mark Meadows indicated their residency at the Scaly Mountain mobile home would begin September 20, 2020 – one day after their voter registration forms were dated.

The North Carolina voter registration form instructs a person to provide their residential address – “where you physically live.” It is signed “under penalty of perjury.” A person is also required to check a box indicating whether they have lived at the address for 30 or more days. If not, a person must list the date they moved to that residence. Both Mark and Debra Meadows checked “no” and listed September 20, 2020.

The Washington Post first reported details about Debra Meadows’ voter forms.

Last week, the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation confirmed to CNN that its Special Investigations Unit is investigating allegations that Mark Meadows registered to vote in 2020 at a home where he never resided. The investigation is being carried out in conjunction with the North Carolina State Board of Elections.

In response to a question Wednesday from CNN whether Debra Meadows is also under investigation, the State Bureau of Investigations said it is “early into this ongoing investigation” and as it moves forward “information will be shared with the prosecutor who will make a determination as to whether any additional persons could be subject to the investigation.”

The Macon County district attorney’s office deferred comment to the state attorney general’s office. The North Carolina State Board of Elections referred all questions pertaining to the investigation to the SBI.

A spokesman for Mark Meadows declined to comment. CNN has also reached out to Debra Meadows via her email with Right Women PAC, for which she is the executive director.

The investigation followed a report in The New Yorker magazine that Meadows registered to vote weeks before the 2020 election at a mobile home in Macon County, where he allegedly never lived or even visited.

The article quoted the unnamed former owner of the McConnell Road property in Scaly Mountain as saying that Meadows’ wife “reserved the house for two months at some point within the past few years – she couldn’t remember exactly when – but only spent one or two nights there” and that Meadows himself had never even “spent a night in there.”

Debra Meadows voted early in person – known as one-stop voting in North Carolina – in Macon County in the 2020 general election. The box on her one-stop application certifying that she was a registered voter in the county and had “resided at the address noted above for 30 days immediately prior this election” was checked. The address listed is the Scaly Mountain mobile home. At the top of the form, it warns that “fraudulently or falsely completely this form is a Class 1 Felony.” Debra Meadows signed the one-stop application on October 26, 2020, the same day state records show she dropped off her husband’s absentee ballot.

An absentee ballot request form for Mark Meadows was submitted the first week of October 2020, with a request to send the ballot to an Alexandria, Virginia, address. The signature on that form is redacted; however, North Carolina State Board of Elections spokesperson Patrick Gannon told CNN that the signature says Mark Meadows. Gannon said it is not clear why Debra Meadows’ information is included in a section for requesting an absentee ballot for a relative. There is also a warning on the absentee ballot request form that “fraudulently or falsely completing this form is a Class 1 felony”.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/24/politics/debra-meadows-mark-north-carolina-voter-form/index.html,2022-03-24
CNN,Kemp signs income tax refund bill into law as Perdue blasts move as 'desperate attempt to get votes',C,"Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp on Wednesday signed a bill that will make hundreds of dollars available to some Georgians in the coming weeks.

Passed by the Republican-controlled legislature earlier this month, the legislation uses more than $1 billion of surplus government funds to provide income tax refunds for state residents who filed returns in 2020 and 2021.

“When the government takes in more than it needs, I believe those dollars should be returned to the taxpayer,” Kemp, a Republican, who is up for reelection this year, said in a statement.

Like many states, Georgia has benefitted from strong tax revenues, which has helped it build up a surplus. It has collected nearly $20 billion in taxes from the start of the fiscal year in July to the end of February, an increase of 16% from the same period a year earlier. Revenue from individual and corporate income taxes, as well as sales taxes, have all grown by double digits so far this fiscal year.

The tax refunds are not the only break that Peach State residents will receive. Kemp and lawmakers also recently suspended the state’s 29.1-cent tax on gas and 32.6-cent tax on diesel, though the end of May.

Kemp’s move mirrors efforts in states across the country to provide relief to their residents in the face of inflation. In California, for example, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has proposed using billions in surplus state funds to dole out $400 debit cards and free public transit for 3 months to help Californians offset the high cost of gas.

Former Sen. David Perdue, who is challenging Kemp in the Republican primary, blasted the Georgia governor’s move as an “election year giveaway and “a desperate attempt to get votes.” The primary is set for May 24, and former President Donald Trump will campaign for Perdue on Saturday.

At a campaign event attended by CNN earlier this month, Stacey Abrams, Kemp’s opponent in the 2018 gubernatorial race and the likely Democratic nominee in this year’s race, called Republicans out for bucking federal Covid relief efforts but still disseminating the funds.

“We have had investments made in the state over the last few years. But let’s be clear about where those dollars came from. As we see these massive amounts of money being passed out in this election year. I want us to remember it’s not who put their name on the cards but who bought the gift. And while there might be a K name on the card, it’s Biden and Warnock who got the money here,” Abrams said at the time.

CNN,Biden says he would be 'fortunate' if Trump ran against him again,C," 
President Joe Biden on Thursday dismissed the challenge posed by a potential rematch with Donald Trump in 2024, saying he’d be “very fortunate” to face Trump again despite polling suggesting that such a contest would be very close.

The remarks are especially notable coming during an emergency overseas trip with Western allies, many of whom fear a return to the America First — and largely anti-NATO — politics of Trump at a time of heightened anxiety about European security.

Between meetings with world leaders in Brussels to coordinate the global response to Russia’s war with Ukraine, Biden was asked in a news conference if he was concerned about whether American foreign policy would remain stable if someone else became president.

Biden told reporters that he’s not thinking about 2024.

“I don’t criticize anybody for asking that question. But the next election – I’d be very fortunate if I had that same man running against me,” Biden told reporters, referring to Trump.

Trump has not formally announced a reelection bid but remains the single most popular figure in the Republican Party and has openly hinted that he will again seek the White House.

Biden said on Thursday that the next election is far off and that he is focused on the upcoming midterms this November.

“So, we’re a long way off in elections, a long way off. My focus of any election is on making sure that we retain the House and the United States Senate so that I have the room to continue to do the things that I’ve been able to do, in terms of grow the economy and deal in a rational way with American foreign policy and be the leader of the free world,” Biden said.

Trump’s nationalist approach to foreign policy sought to break away from several longstanding US foreign policy traditions – inciting trade wars with the European Union, pulling back the US’ contribution to NATO’s collective budget and accusing NATO allies of freeloading off American generosity. Since his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump asserted that some NATO member countries hadn’t made requisite financial contributions for their common defense, suggesting the US would not have to fight for allied members if they had not fulfilled their obligations.

Biden has sought to brand his presidency as one in which the US has returned to the diplomatic stage following an era of isolation under Trump. And he’s repeatedly argued that America has a leading role to play in ensuring democracies persevere over autocracies.

Biden and the White House have previously indicated that the President intends to run for reelection and that he plans to have Vice President Kamala Harris continue on as his running mate.

Biden told ABC News in December that he plans to run again, but suggested added that he’s “a great respecter of fate.”

“Fate has intervened in my life many, many times. If I’m in the health I’m in now – I’m in good health – then in fact I would run again,” Biden continued.

The President also said at the time that he would be up for a rematch against Trump, jokingly responding, “You’re trying to tempt me now.”

“Sure. Why would I not run against Donald Trump? (If) he’s the nominee, that increases the prospect of running,” Biden added.

A recent Wall Street Journal poll revealed that a majority of registered voters don’t believe that Biden will run for a second term in 2024. Less than 1 in 3 respondents expect him to run again.

CNN,North Korea fires first suspected ICBM since 2017,C,"Seoul, South Korea
CNN
 — 
North Korea has fired what is believed to be its first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) in more than four years as Western leaders gather in Brussels for a security summit.

The suspected ICBM flew to an altitude of 6,000 kilometers (3,728 miles) and to a distance of 1,080 kilometers (671 miles) with a flight time of 71 minutes before splashing down in waters off Japan’s western coast on Thursday, according to Japan’s Defense Ministry.

Thursday’s launch is North Korea’s 11th of the year, including one on March 16 which is presumed to have failed. Analysts said the test could be the longest-range missile yet fired by North Korea, exceeding its last ICBM launch in November 2017.

Japan’s Vice Defense Minister Makoto Oniki told reporters Thursday the missile’s altitude would suggest it is a “new type of ICBM,” a potential sign North Korea is closer to developing weapons capable of targeting the United States.

North Korean state media later appeared to confirm Oniki’s assessment, announcing the launch of a Hwasong-17 missile, the country’s newest known ICBM variant.

The US joined allies South Korea and Japan in strongly condemning the launch Thursday and called on North Korea to refrain from further destabilizing acts.

US President Joe Biden is currently in Belgium, where he is attending a G7 summit alongside Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. The gathering is part of a series of meetings, including an extraordinary NATO summit, as Western leaders seek to align their responses to Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine. A European Council meeting will also take place Thursday.

According to analysts, the recent spate of North Korean missile tests suggest the country’s leader, Kim Jong Un, is attempting show an increasingly turbulent world that Pyongyang remains a player in the struggle for power and influence.

“North Korea refuses to be ignored and may be trying to take advantage of global preoccupation with the war in Ukraine to force a fait accompli on its status as a nuclear weapons state,” Leif-Eric Easley, associate professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, told CNN.

“North Korea is nowhere near initiating aggression on the scale of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But Pyongyang’s ambitions likewise exceed self-defense as it wants to overturn the postwar security order in Asia, added Easley.

Thursday’s test also comes just two weeks after South Korea elected a new conservative President, Yoon Suk Yeol, who is expected to take a harder line against North Korea than outgoing office holder President Moon Jae-in.

In response to Thursday’s suspected ICBM test, South Korea’s military launched several warning missiles for the first time since 2017, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said in a text sent to reporters.

“Our military is monitoring North Korean military’s movements and have confirmed that we have the capability and posture to accurately strike the origin location of the missile launch and command and support facilities any time North Korea launches a missile,” the JCS said.

Provocative act
Analysts said North Korea appeared to have conducted a so-called lofted missile test Thursday. “This is a tactic often employed by them to test longer range systems without more provocatively overflying another country,” said Joseph Dempsey, research associate for defense and military analysis at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.

He said the preliminary data of Thursday’s test indicate it could be a Hwasong-17, a much larger ICBM than the Hwasong-15 tested in 2017.

Kim Dong-yub, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, said data indicates Thursday’s missile could have a maximum range of about 15,000 kilometers (9,320 miles) – theoretically putting it within reach of the continental United States, depending on the weight of the warhead it would carry – and about 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles) further than the Hwasong-15.

Despite the potentially extended range, Kim said Pyongyang has still yet to demonstrate its ability to master the technology required to enable a warhead to successfully re-enter the Earth’s atmosphere into the final stages of flight.

US response
Pyongyang’s other most recent launches, on February 26 and March 4, were likely intended to test a new ICBM system, the US Defense Department said earlier this month.

The US Indo-Pacific Command announced earlier this month that the US is intensifying “intelligence, readiness and surveillance collection activities” related to North Korea following the recent missile launches.

The move is a signal from the Biden administration that it needs to strengthen its military posture to ensure the US and allies in the region like South Korea and Japan are protected against North Korea’s missile tests.

The command said they have “ordered intensified Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance collection activities in the Yellow Sea, as well as enhanced readiness among our ballistic missile defense forces in the region.”

Earlier this month, the US military staged exercises on and around the Korean Peninsula to show its readiness in the wake of North Korean activity, including simulating ballistic missile defense systems.

The US Army’s 35th Air Defense Artillery Brigade moved to a remote location, “occupying its wartime defensive position, emplacing the Patriot missile system, and executing air and missile defense operations under a simulated combat scenario,” US Forces Korea said in a press release.

And at sea, F-35 and F/A-18 fighter jets flying off the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln along with US Air Force assets based in the region put on a show of force in the Yellow Sea off the western coast of South Korea, according to a statement from the US Navy’s 7th Fleet in Japan.

CNN,Manhattan prosecutor who quit team investigating Trump insists ex-President is guilty,C,"A former Manhattan prosecutor who investigated Donald Trump and his business empire said in his resignation letter obtained by CNN that the former President was “guilty of numerous felony violations” in connection to his annual financial statements.

“His financial statements were false, and he has a long history of fabricating information relating to his personal finances and lying about his assets to banks, the national media, counterparties, and many others, including the American people,” Mark Pomerantz wrote in the letter. “The team that has been investigating Mr. Trump harbors no doubt about whether he committed crimes — he did.”

Pomerantz and Carey Dunne, two senior prosecutors on the team, resigned last month – one day after Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg informed them that he wasn’t prepared to move forward with criminal charges. The resignations followed weeks of internal debate and discussion over the strength of the evidence against Trump and whether it could pass the hurdle of proving a crime.

Trump has not been charged with a crime.

According to Pomerantz, the previous district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr., had “concluded that the facts warranted prosecution, and he directed the team to present evidence to a grand jury and to seek an indictment of Mr. Trump.”

Bragg took over in January. His office insists that the investigation is ongoing and has announced that another attorney has been appointed to lead the team.

“The investigation continues,” said Danielle Filson, spokeswoman for the district attorney. “A team of experienced prosecutors is working every day to follow the facts and the law. There is nothing more we can or should say at this juncture about an ongoing investigation.”

According to Pomerantz, the investigation has been suspended pending further developments. “I believe that your decision not to prosecute Donald Trump now, and on the existing record, is misguided and completely contrary to the public interest,” he wrote to Bragg. “I therefore cannot continue in my current position.”

Pomerantz also warned that a failure to prosecute will undermine public confidence in the justice system and “the bedrock proposition that ‘no man is above the law.’ ” He added that the “ability to establish what happened may erode with the further passage of time.”

Pomerantz declined to comment about the letter to CNN.

Ronald Fischetti, an attorney for Trump, disputed Pomerantz’s characterization of the case.

“There just was not sufficient evidence to charge my client,” Fischetti told CNN. “Believe me, I’ve worked on this case for longer than Mark was there. I know the evidence that he has, he doesn’t have one live witness who would take the stand and point a finger at Donald Trump and say that he was corrupt. Not one.”

“In my opinion, I think Alvin Bragg should get credit for what he did. He decided this case based on the lack of evidence, not based on politics,” Fischetti said.

CNN,Tencent stock tumbles after China crackdown hits growth,C,"Hong Kong
CNN Business
 — 
Tencent’s stock suffered a sharp drop after the company reported its slowest-ever growth due to a bruising crackdown by China on the country’s tech sector.

Shares in the Chinese social media and gaming giant tumbled around 6% in Hong Kong on Thursday after its US-listed shares closed 5.4% lower on Wall Street.

The stock plunge came after Tencent (TCEHY) reported revenue of 144.2 billion yuan ($22.6 billion) for the fourth quarter of 2021, up 8% from a year earlier. That’s the slowest revenue growth since the company listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2004.

Tencent’s annual revenue for 2021 was up 16% compared to the previous year, slowing from the 28% growth it recorded in 2020.

Co-founder Pony Ma and president Martin Lau joined an earnings call on late Wednesday and acknowledged that 2021 was a “challenging year” for Tencent and China’s internet industry more broadly. Since November 2020, Chinese authorities have launched a sweeping crackdown in an effort to rein in big players in industries ranging from tech and finance to gaming, entertainment and private education.

The internet industry has faced “fundamental changes and challenges,” Lau said during the call, adding that “new regulations have been introduced” to correct industry misbehavior and promote fair competition, user protection and data security.

These “structural industry challenges” have affected Tencent’s financial performance, leading to slower revenue growth as the company adjusted to the new environment, Lau said.

Both Ma and Lau endorsed Beijing’s crackdown on the tech industry, reiterating regulators’ words that the government restrictions will help end the industry’s “reckless expansion” and “frothy growth.”

“We are proactively embracing changes to better align ourselves with a new industry paradigm,” Lau said, adding that the company will focus more on user value, tech innovation, and social responsibility.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/23/tech/tencent-earnings-q4-2021-china-crackdown-intl-hnk/index.html,2022-03-23

CNN Business
 — 
Mackenzie Scott said Wednesday she has donated more than $3.8 billion to 465 organizations since June.

In a Medium post, Scott said her team’s focus in the past nine months continued to be helping underrepresented people from various backgrounds and communities. The billionaire philanthropist gave money to Planned Parenthood locations across the United States as well as to organizations helping at-risk children, minorities, refugees and rural health access, according to the post.

Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, recently gave $436 million to Habitat for Humanity — her largest known donation to date — and $133.5 million to educational nonprofit Communities in School, according to previous statements from the organizations.

“When our giving team focuses on any system in which people are struggling, we don’t assume that we, or any other single group, can know how to fix it. We don’t advocate for particular policies or reforms,” Scott wrote. “Instead, we seek a portfolio of organizations that supports the ability of all people to participate in solutions. This means a focus on the needs of those whose voices have been underrepresented.”

With an estimated net worth of $55 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Scott is well known for her philanthropic behaviors and surprise donations to organizations. Scott signed the Giving Pledge in 2019, a non-binding agreement launched in 2010 by Warren Buffett and Bill and Melinda Gates for billionaires to promise to give away their wealth to those in need.

CNN,Arizona is the first state to accept digital driver's licenses on iPhones,C,"iPhone owners with an Arizona driver’s license or state ID can now upload either to their Apple Wallet, marking the first time a US state has supported digital versions of this type of identification in the app. But the uses remain very limited, for now.

Starting Wednesday, Arizona residents with TSA PreCheck can present their digital driver’s license or state ID by tapping their iPhone or Apple Watch at select Transportation Security Administration checkpoints in Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. However, they’ll still need their physical IDs to fly home if traveling to a state that’s not in the Apple program — in other words, any other state in the country.

iPhone users will also still need to show their physical ID to, for example, enter a bar, get documents notarized or show law enforcement at traffic stops, both in other states and in Arizona. Apple said it is exploring more ways for people to use digital verification in the future.

Last year, Apple (AAPL) teased it was working with several states on the initiative, including Georgia, Connecticut, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma and Utah. Apple (AAPL) originally noted on its website that the feature would launch last year, but the company told CNN Business it was a complicated process to implement and it’s been working closely with the states to make this available as soon as possible.

On Wednesday, Apple announced plans to also introduce the feature to Colorado, Hawaii, Mississippi, Ohio and Puerto Rico.

The rollout is part of Apple’s ongoing effort to boost support for its digital wallet. Apple already offers features such as digital credit cards, movie tickets, car keys, boarding passes and gift cards. These features offer the promise of an added layer of convenience, push iOS users deeper into its ecosystem of services, and make the iPhone even more central to our lives.

To ensure the ID is official, the user will have to take a selfie after scanning and uploading a picture of their driver’s license or state ID card. The user will also be required to complete facial and head movements, similar to how Face ID is activated. The upload will be “securely provided” to the state for verification, according to Apple.

Once activated and approved, users can tap their iPhone or Apple Watch on the identity reader at the security checkpoint and the agent will see the information required to fly. It works similarly to how people use the Wallet to make purchases at card readers.

Apple previously said information on the IDs is “encrypted and protected against tampering and theft.” Biometric authentication is also used to ensure the proper person is using the phone or watch.

On their iPhone or Apple Watch, users will be shown which specific information is requested by the TSA. The user can agree to provide that information with Face ID or Touch ID, without having to unlock their iPhone. All information is shared digitally, so users do not need to show or hand over their device to present their ID.

Driver’s license and state ID support on Apple Wallet is available on iPhone 8 or later running iOS 15.4, and Apple Watch Series 4 or later running watchOS 8.4 or later.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/23/tech/apple-drivers-license/index.html,2022-03-23
CNN,"John Kerry plans to stay in climate envoy role through late 2022, says climate action in Congress is 'imperative'",C,"
John Kerry, President Joe Biden’s Special Envoy for Climate, told CNN he plans to stay in his current role through at least the next major international climate summit in November.

“There’s no plan to do otherwise at this point in time, certainly,” Kerry told CNN Thursday. “I haven’t even thought about anything else right now.”

Kerry said he plans to attend the 2022 UN climate summit – COP27 – in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, to press other countries to raise their climate ambitions, slash methane and carbon emissions, and transition to renewable energy faster.

People close to Kerry told CNN in November that it was widely assumed he would step down after COP26 in Glasgow.

Countries promised at that summit to come to COP27 with plans in-hand on how to slash their fossil fuel use. And while the final deal from COP26, the Glasgow Climate Pact, made an unprecedented mention of the role of fossil fuels in the climate crisis, it failed to secure a commitment to phase out the use of coal – which has a significant impact on global warming and creates harmful air pollution.

“We hope to go to Sharm el-Sheikh with a clear roadmap of what has been accomplished with respect to those promises made, and what has been done to raise the level of ambition and commitment from those who haven’t yet done that,” Kerry said. “That’s our current target, with this effort here. We’re currently gearing up to try to make sure that we can get done all the things I just described.”

Action from Congress ‘is absolutely imperative’
Kerry spoke to CNN from Paris, where he was attending the International Energy Agency’s annual ministerial meeting. Domestic policy crept into the Climate Envoy’s conversations Wednesday night, when Kerry told CNN he had dinner with West Virgina Sen. Joe Manchin, Democrats’ key swing vote on climate legislation, who was also attending the IEA meeting.

“We talked and shared a table last night at dinner and we had a nice conversation about it all,” Kerry told CNN, not going into details about what was discussed.

Climate action in Congress is riding on Manchin’s shoulders, after he torpedoed Biden’s Build Back Better legislation, which included more than $500 billion in clean energy measures.

Manchin has said he’s supportive of clean energy tax credits. But amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Manchin – the chair of the Senate Energy Committee – has also called for more fossil fuel production in the US to help Europe move away from Russia’s natural gas.

“I think he is definitively concerned about doing some of the things he thinks ought to be done,” Kerry said. Whether that takes shape in a bill “is up to him and the folks he’s negotiating directly with” in the White House.

Speaking at the IEA on Wednesday, Manchin described what he considers an ideal US energy transition, including promoting carbon capture and sequestration for fossil fuels, passing clean energy manufacturing tax credits and providing more funding for advanced nuclear reactors.

But Manchin also expressed skepticism about the shift to electric vehicles, a key plank of Biden and Democrats’ climate plans.

“I’m a little bit skeptical of the electric vehicles that everyone’s moving to as rapidly as they are,” Manchin said. “I’m very much concerned about the supply chain. I am very much concerned about being totally relying on China to supply the necessary resources we need to have that transition happen.”

But Kerry said he is still optimistic a climate action bill will pass through Congress.

“It’s not going to be Build Back Better; it’s going to be something different,” Kerry said. “My hope is we’re going to pass it. I feel like there’s greater potential that we will do that than some people may believe. I trust that there’s some real possibility of getting climate legislation passed as part of something.”

He added that the US taking legislative action on the climate crisis is “absolutely imperative.”

“I don’t want to speculate what happens if we don’t,” Kerry told CNN. “I’m going to count on doing it, because we’ve got to do it.”

Helping Europe wean off Russian natural gas
Biden on Friday is expected to make a major announcement on increasing US liquid natural gas shipments exports to help Europe transition away from Russian fuel – which some climate advocacy groups oppose, fearing it would require new infrastructure that would produce fossil fuel for years to come.

Kerry said the natural gas announcement will mark “a beginning, it’s not the end of the process.”

Other countries are planning to increase their natural gas exports to Europe as well; Kerry met with Israel’s IEA delegation and said that country stepping up their gas production could account for about 10% of what Russia currently supplies to Europe.

But the US climate envoy said non-fossil fuel options – like electric heat pumps – have also been part of the conversation. Heat pumps are energy-efficient heating systems that can replace natural gas furnaces.

“There’s a lot of discussion going on right now about heat pumps specifically and about other things that we can do to assist Europe to minimize the impact of the loss of Russian gas and oil,” Kerry said. “Not all these plans have been carved in stone at this point. I think heat pumps are a very real alternative to the burning of fuel that takes place today.”

Kerry said he thinks it makes the most sense for Europe to manufacture their own heat pumps, and for the US to jump in and manufacture more if the demand grows.

“Europe makes terrific heat pumps,” Kerry said. “I would imagine the Europeans are hot to trot in their own market here; I don’t think they’re sitting around waiting for the US to necessarily do it. But where it might be necessary – yes, it makes sense for other markets to contribute the products where the demand exists.”

Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico recently told CNN he’s been having discussions with top economic officials in the White House about increasing the US production of heat pumps to send to Europe.

Heinrich said he met with National Economic Council Director Brian Deese and White House American Rescue Plan coordinator Gene Sperling last week and pushed the idea of ramping up heat pump production.

“There’s certainly a lot of interest,” Heinrich told CNN of the meeting, adding Sperling and Deese “are both very aware of what we’re pushing, and seem receptive.”

CNN,Jackson expected to be first Black woman confirmed to US Supreme Court this week,C,"Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson is expected to be confirmed as the first Black woman Supreme Court justice this week, after a bipartisan group of senators voted on Monday to advance her nomination.

After the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 11-11, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called for a vote to break the deadlock and send her nomination to the floor. Every Democrat and three Republican senators -- Susan Collins of Maine, Mitt Romney of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska -- voted in support of Jackson.
Senate Republican and Democratic leaders agree that Jackson is a well-qualified nominee, but almost all GOP senators are expected to oppose her. Jackson, 51, sits on DC's federal appellate court and had been considered the front-runner for the vacancy since Justice Stephen Breyer announced his retirement. Jackson previously worked as a clerk for Breyer, a federal public defender, an attorney in private practice, a federal district court judge and a member of the US Sentencing Commission.
""Justice Jackson will bring to the Supreme Court, the highest level of skill, integrity, civility and grace,"" said Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin, the Judiciary Committee chairman, in explaining his support for her on Monday. ""This committee's action today is nothing less than making history. I'm honored to be part of it.""
But the vast majority of Senate Republicans will oppose her, citing concerns with her judicial philosophy, or lack thereof, her sentencing in some criminal cases and her advocacy for certain clients. So far, only three Senate Republicans -- Collins, Romney and Murkowski -- have said they would support Jackson.
""My support rests on Judge Jackson's qualifications, which no one questions; her demonstrated judicial independence; her demeanor and temperament; and the important perspective she would bring to the court as a replacement for Justice Breyer,"" said Murkowski on Monday. ""It also rests on my rejection of the corrosive politicization of the review process for Supreme Court nominees, which, on both sides of the aisle, is growing worse and more detached from reality by the year.""
Some GOP senators said on Monday they were not swayed by Jackson's assertion that she does not have a judicial philosophy per se but instead a methodology that ensures she rules impartially.
""The judge must call balls and strikes,"" said Texas GOP Sen. John Cornyn, alluding to Chief Justice John Roberts' metaphor comparing a judge to an umpire. ""And given what I've seen, and her unwillingness to disclose her judicial philosophy, and disavow an expansionist view of unenumerated rights, I have concerns that Judge Jackson will be pinch hitting for one team or the other.""
Other Republican senators portrayed Jackson as a pawn of the ""radical left."" Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said he believed ""she will prove to be the most extreme and the furthest-left justice ever to serve on the United States Supreme Court."" Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton said Jackson would ""coddle criminals and terrorists."" And Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley lambasted her sentencing decisions in some child pornography cases.

Democrats said that some Republicans were fear-mongering and cherry-picking cases, noting she authored over 550 cases in her eight years as a district judge and had already been confirmed by the Senate to three prior positions. California Sen. Dianne Feinstein said that Jackson ""had the very low reversal rate of only 2%."" Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal said the GOP had engaged in ""meritless demagoguery"" and ""concocted outrage."" And New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker noted Jackson's support from law enforcement groups, including the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the Fraternal Order of Police, and those advocating for victims like the National Children's Alliance.
One potential Republican vote for Jackson was South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who supported Jackson a year ago for her current job. But he said last week that he would oppose her, citing her sentencing for cases of child pornography and representation of detainees at Guantanamo Bay.

Graham, a member of the Judiciary Committee, said that while Jackson exhibits ""exceptionally good character,"" she was too lenient in sentencing those cases and had an ""activist zeal"" in calling former President George W. Bush and former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld war criminals in legal briefs as she advocated for a detainee.
""My decision is based upon her record of judicial activism, flawed sentencing methodology regarding child pornography cases and a belief Judge Jackson will not be deterred by the plain meaning of the law when it comes to liberal causes,"" said Graham.
An in-depth CNN review of the child pornography cases showed that Jackson had mostly followed common judicial sentencing practices. It has become a norm among judges to issue sentences below the guidelines in such cases that don't involve producing the pornography itself. As for her advocacy for Guantanamo detainees, Jackson argued that they had been tortured and subjected to other inhumane treatment but did not explicitly use the phrase ""war criminal."" Jackson's four detainee clients were not convicted and were eventually released from Guantanamo.
Durbin refuted Graham on both issues on the Senate floor last week, calling Jackson ""in the mainstream of sentencing"" of child pornography cases and saying Republicans have also voted for President Donald Trump's judges who ""do exactly the same thing she does."" He said it was a ""gross exaggeration and unfair on its face"" to say that Jackson had called Bush administration officials ""war criminals.""
It's rare for the Senate Judiciary Committee to tie on a Supreme Court nomination. But nomination battles have become increasingly contentious, and the current Senate is split 50-50, so there are an even number of Democrats and Republicans on the panel, rather than the majority party holding more seats.

Over the past five decades, the panel has deadlocked once -- over Clarence Thomas, who was facing sexual harassment allegations. Fifteen justices -- William Rehnquist, John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, John Roberts, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Neil Gorsuch , Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett -- passed the committee during that timeframe.
In 1987, Democrats who controlled the committee voted to unfavorably recommend President Ronald Reagan's nominee Robert Bork on ideological grounds. And in 2020, Democrats boycotted a committee vote on Barrett, arguing that the chamber should not consider President Donald Trump's lifetime appointment to the court while the country was voting in the presidential election.
In the Trump era, Senate Republicans strengthened the conservatives' grip on the court from 5-4 to 6-3, after holding up President Barack Obama's nominee Merrick Garland during another election year -- 2016 -- and then confirming Gorsuch in 2017, and Coney Barrett in 2020 to replace the late Ginsburg. Jackson's confirmation would likely replace a liberal -- Breyer -- with another.
""I think all indications are that Judge Jackson is going to be a liberal activist from the bench,"" said Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell on Fox last week. ""But the good news for people like me, is the Court is still 6-3.""
""We made massive changes over the last four years that I think put the Court in a very solid position with a great number of judges who believe in the quaint notion that maybe a judge ought to follow the law,"" he added.

CNN,Tokyo's iconic Nakagin Capsule Tower to be demolished,C,"One of Japan's most distinctive works of contemporary architecture, the Nakagin Capsule Tower in Tokyo, will be demolished this month, according to the building's new owners.
The decision ends years of uncertainty surrounding the eye-catching structure, which once offered a futuristic vision of urban living but had recently fallen into disrepair.
Completed in 1972, the tower comprises 144 factory-built units arranged around two concrete cores. Each 10-square-meter (108-square-foot) ""capsule"" features a porthole-style window, with appliances and furniture built into the structure of each home.

The building is considered a prime example of Metabolism, an architectural movement that emerged from the ruins of World War II with a radical new vision for Japan's cities. As well as embracing technology and mass production, the avant-garde group's members looked to nature for inspiration, with structural components treated like organic cells that could be ""plugged"" into a larger whole or later replaced.
The Japanese architects who treated buildings like living organisms
The building's designer, Kisho Kurokawa -- one of Metabolism's youngest adherents -- had originally envisaged the Tokyo tower's capsules being replaced every 25 years. But they instead grew dilapidated and outdated, with many of the apartments now sitting empty, used for storage and office space, or rented out to architecture enthusiasts on a short-term basis.
In 2007, the owners' association voted to sell the tower to a property developer that intended to demolish and replace it. But the firm filed for bankruptcy during the 2008 recession, and the site's fate was thrown into years-long limbo.

Owners again agreed to sell in 2021, and the building was acquired by a group of real estate firms operating under the name Capusule Tower Building (CTB). A spokesperson for the joint venture, Takashi Shindo, told CNN over the phone that the last residents moved out last month, with demolition scheduled to begin April 12.
Preservationists had long expressed hope that the building might be saved -- including Kurokawa, before his death in 2007. Petitions and campaigns have called for the structure to be protected as an example of Japan's architectural heritage. (Although the Metabolism movement proved influential, very few of its proposals were ever realized, making Nakagin Capsule Tower a rare living example of the group's philosophy.)
The organization behind the conservation campaign, the Nakagin Capsule Tower Building Preservation and Regeneration Project, asked city authorities to intervene -- and even considered applying for protected status with UNESCO. But neither approach proved successful, according to project member Tatsuyuki Maeda, who acquired 15 of the capsules between 2010 and the building's sale last year.

""Japan does not have the legislation to preserve this kind of architectural culture,"" he said over the phone. ""It is unfortunate that one of the country's most representative examples of modern architectural heritage will be lost.""

Maeda said that efforts to raise the 2 to 3 billion yen ($16 million to $24 million) required to renovate the tower and remove asbestos were hampered by the Covid-19 pandemic. The project has since shifted focus towards raising funds to refurbish and repurpose individual units in the hope that institutions might look to acquire ""unplugged"" capsules.
Maeda said the project has received around 80 inquiries, with the Centre Pompidou in Paris among the museums to have expressed interest in obtaining one, he added. The Museum of Modern Art in Saitama, Japan, meanwhile has a unit in its collection already.

Kurokawa's architecture firm, which continued operating after his death, announced that it intends to preserve the building in a ""digital space.""
""We are determined to preserve the capsules, even if the building is demolished,"" said Maeda. ""Dozens of capsules with relatively little aging will be recovered and rehabilitated.
""There is no doubt that the building was famous, but the Capsule Tower also had a certain charm that appealed to people. Everyone who stayed there was creative in his or her own way, and the community that formed was truly fascinating. I am sad to see it go, but I hope it will live on in a new form.""

CNN,Footage of Prince as an 11-year-old unearthed by news station,C,"(CNN)A CNN affiliate station in Minneapolis stumbled upon a rare gem -- archival footage of the late, great icon Prince at 11 years old, supporting public school teachers on strike.

Staffers at WCCO were combing through the station's archives for old clips from a local teachers' strike in 1970 to include in a piece about a more recent strike when they spotted a familiar face in one of the clips.
An interviewer in the 1970 clip asked a young boy whether most of the kids present at the strike were in favor of their teachers picketing. The boy, wearing a very familiar smirk, replied, ""Yup.""
""I think they should get some more money, because they work extra hours for us, and all that stuff,"" he said in the clip.

The staff at WCCO were certain that the boy they'd spotted was Prince -- the only thing they were missing was footage of the boy saying his name. So, to confirm his identity, the station reached out to Prince's old friend and schoolmate Terrance Jackson, who'd known the Purple One since kindergarten and even performed with him in his first band, Grand Central.
When WCCO anchor Jeff Wagner showed Jackson the footage, Prince's old friend laughed in glee. And when he listened to a young Prince speak, Jackson was speechless and teary.
""Wow, that was him,"" Jackson said after pausing in awe, confirming that the boy in the clip was indeed a preteen Prince Rogers Nelson. ""I'm totally blown away.""
The young musician was already playing guitar and the keyboard by the time the video was shot, Jackson said.
Prince, who in 2016 died of an accidental overdose of fentanyl, is widely beloved in Minneapolis -- and he loved it back throughout his life, often recording at his studio and home, Paisley Park, outside the city. After he died, WCCO uncovered donations he made to organizations throughout the city that he didn't discuss publicly, including funding for a school and over $1 million through his own charity.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/04/entertainment/prince-childhood-footage-wcco-archives-cec/index.html,2022-04-04
CNN,Jon Batiste privately married Suleika Jaouad before her bone marrow transplant,C,"(CNN)Jon Batiste quietly married Suleika Jaouad, his longtime girlfriend, in February.

Jaouad, who is the author of the cancer memoir ""Between Two Kingdoms,"" said the event happened right before she was scheduled for a bone marrow transplant. She had been diagnosed with leukemia for the second time.
""We got married the day before I was admitted to the hospital to undergo my bone marrow transplant,"" she told ""CBS Sunday Morning.""
Jaouad continued: ""We have known that we wanted to get married, I think, from the first week that we started dating. That's when Jon first brought up the topic of marriage to me. So, we've had eight years. This is not, you know, a hasty decision!""
She added that her diagnosis wasn't actually a factor in the two tying the knot.
""He said to me, 'I just want to be very clear, I'm not proposing to you because of this diagnosis. It's taken me a year to design your ring. So, just know this timing has nothing to do with it. But what I do want you to know is that this diagnosis doesn't change anything. It just makes it all the clearer to me that I want to commit to this and for us to be together. But once we realized we had this tiny window before the bone marrow transplant, we decided to go for it.""
She said the wedding was ""tiny"" but perfect.
""And I'll tell you, we walked into that bone marrow transplant unit on cloud nine. We were so happy, so brimming with love and positivity from this beautiful evening that we'd had. And I really believe that that carried us through,"" she said.

CNN,Denzel Washington speaks publicly about Will Smith Oscar slap,C,"(CNN)Denzel Washington spoke publicly about his interaction with Will Smith on Oscar night and what happened after Smith slapped Chris Rock on stage.

Washington was a guest and speaker at Bishop T.D. Jakes' leadership summit on Saturday. During the two-hour discussion about faith and his award-winning acting career, Washington was asked about the infamous slap and what happened afterward.
""Well, there's a saying when the devil ignores you, then you know you're doing something wrong,"" Washington said in video of the exchange posted on Jakes' verified Twitter account.
""You know, the devil goes, 'Oh, no, leave him alone, he's my favorite. Don't bother him.' Conversely, when the devil comes at you, maybe it's because you're trying to do something right. And for whatever reason, the devil got a hold of that circumstance that night.""

At the Academy Awards, Smith walked to the stage and slapped Chris Rock, who was presenting at the time, after he made a joke about Jada Pinkett Smith's shaved head.
Shortly after the incident, Smith won his first Academy Award and offered his apologies to the Academy and others for the earlier incident.
During his acceptance speech, Smith said that prior to his win, fellow nominee Washington shared some wisdom with him: ""At your highest moment be careful, that's when the devil comes for you.""
Washington said during Saturday's discussion that he, along with actor and producer Tyler Perry, prayed with Smith after the incident.
""Fortunately, there were people there, not just me, but others in the gap,"" Washington told Jakes. ""Tyler Perry came right immediately, right over there with me.""
Washington would not say what the three men spoke or prayed about after the incident.
""Who are we to condemn?"" Washington asked. ""I don't know all the ins and outs of the situation, but I know the only solution was prayer.""
Smith issued an apology on Monday in a statement on Instagram, calling his behavior ""unacceptable and inexcusable.""",https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/03/entertainment/denzel-washington-will-smith-oscar-slap/index.html,2022-04-03
CNN,Kanye West drops out of Coachella,C,"(CNN)Kanye West has backed out of headlining Coachella, a source close to the artist confirmed to CNN Monday.

West, who now goes by Ye, had been set to be one of the headliners of The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival along with Billie Eilish and Harry Styles.
The source said that West did not want to take the stage in the midst of his divorce battle with Kim Kardashian and in the wake of his one-sided feud with ""Daily Show"" host Trevor Noah.
In the past several weeks West has taken to social media to air his grievances about co-parenting issues with Kardashian.
He was suspended from Instagram for 24 hours for posting a racial slur aimed at Noah after the late-night host voiced his concern about West's feuding with Kardashian.
A performance by Ye at Sunday's Grammy Awards was also subsequently canceled, according to three sources close to the artists, citing his ""online behavior.""
Ye did not attend the event but won two Grammys.
The annual event is held over two weekends at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, California, and this year is scheduled to take place April 15-17 and April 22-24.
West had earlier threatened to quit Coachella after Eilish made a comment he perceived to be bashing Travis Scott - something Eilish denied.

CNN,"At least 13 dead, nearly 50 injured in weekend shootings around US",C,"(CNN)At least 13 people were killed and more than 40 others injured in shootings across the country this weekend, including one in Sacramento, where the police chief called the scale of violence ""unprecedented"" in her 27-year career there.

Six people died and 12 were injured in that incident early Sunday, which investigators believe involves multiple shooters, Police Chief Katherine Lester said. The mass shooting not far from the California State Capitol is one of the largest of the more than 120 in the US so far this year, according to data collected by the Gun Violence Archive.
The GVA, like CNN, defines a mass shooting as four or more people shot, not including the shooter. There were, however, shootings this weekend that did not meet the definition, including one at a Norfolk, Virginia, mall which left 1 dead and 2 injured.
This weekend's violence comes just two weeks after the largest-scale US mass shooting in more than two years happened at a car show in Dumas, Arkansas, where one person died and at least 27 were injured.
Here's a look at the rash of shootings reported this weekend.
Sacramento, California: 6 dead and at least 12 injured

""The scale of violence that just happened in our city is unprecedented during my 27 years here at the Sacramento Police Department,"" Lester said.
Some or all of the victims' bodies remained at the crime scene Sunday afternoon partially because of the investigation's complexity, Lester said.
It is not clear why the crowd had gathered or whether it was connected to a venue or event, Lester said.
The downtown location is near a strip of nightclubs and close to several notable landmarks: the California State Capitol, Sacramento City Hall and the sports arena Golden 1 Center, where the NBA's Sacramento Kings played Sunday night.
Police on Sunday were asking for the public's help in finding the shooters. Police do not have a description of any suspects.

CNN,"Georgia settles with widow of Black man killed by state trooper for $4.8 million, attorneys say",C,"(CNN)The widow of Julian E. Lewis, a Black man who was fatally shot by a Georgia state trooper in August 2020, will receive a $4.8 million settlement from the state, attorneys representing the family said.

""While the record-making settlement does not bring back her husband for widow Betty Lewis and other family and loved ones, it sends a powerful message to the State and those in law enforcement and other positions of power that unnecessary use of force against innocent citizens is unlawful, morally corrupt and carries legal consequences,"" a statement released by Hall and Lampros, Attorneys at Law said.
Lewis, 60, was shot in the face and killed when trooper Jacob Gordon Thompson, 27, attempted to stop him for a traffic-related offense in Screven County near Savannah.

When Lewis refused to stop, Thompson gave a brief chase before using a ""precision Intervention technique,"" sending the car to a stop in a ditch, according to a statement released by Georgia Bureau of Investigation at the time the incident occurred.
Thompson then fired one shot, striking Lewis in the face. Lewis was pronounced dead on the scene.
""Our hearts grieve for Betty Lewis, who lost her Golden Years with her husband because of unwarranted and unnecessary deadly force during what should have been a routine traffic stop,"" attorney Andrew Lampros said in the statement.
Thompson was charged with felony murder and aggravated assault, but a grand jury declined to indict him. He was terminated from the Georgia Department of Public Safety.
CNN's calls to Thompson's attorney were not returned, but the attorney, Keith Barber, declined to comment to the New York Times.
Lewis' family has asked for a second grand jury to look at the case. The US Attorney's office announced last year it was in consultation with the FBI regarding the shooting's circumstances.
""The events of that August night should never have happened. Shooting an unarmed man without cause is unconscionable, and violates the freedom that the United States Constitution guarantees all individuals,"" Lampros said. ""We were prepared to sue the trooper, the department and its leadership asserting both Constitutional claims as well as state law tort claims.""
The attorneys said the settlement is the largest in Georgia since at least 1990, referencing historical data they obtained from the Georgia Department of Administrative Services through an Open Records request.
Kara Richardson, spokesperson for the Georgia Attorney General's Office, confirmed the settlement for $4.8 million but did not provide any additional comment on it.

CNN,Bidens to host White House wedding reception for granddaughter in November,C,"(CNN)President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden will host a wedding reception at the White House this November for their eldest granddaughter, Naomi Biden, the first lady's communications director Elizabeth Alexander confirmed to CNN. The White House reception is set for November 19; there is no word yet on where the nuptial ceremony will occur.

""The first family, the couple, and their parents are still in the planning stages of all of the wedding festivities and look forward to announcing further details in the coming months,"" Alexander said.
Naomi Biden, 28, is the daughter of Hunter Biden and Kathleen Buhle. She is a lawyer, currently based in Washington, DC. Biden became engaged to Peter Neal, 24, in September of last year when Neal proposed near his childhood home in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, according to a White House official. Biden's engagement ring includes the band of Neal's grandmother's engagement ring. The couple has been together for approximately four years, after meeting in New York City on a date, set up by a mutual friend. Neal is in his final semester of law school at the University of Pennsylvania.

The White House has a long history as the location for weddings of presidential offspring, dating back to the 1800s, when the children of James Monroe, John Quincy Adams, John Tyler and Ulysses S. Grant were married there. Both of Woodrow Wilson's daughters held their weddings at the White House, as well as his niece, in 1913, 1914, and 1918, respectively.
More recently, Lynda Bird Johnson, daughter of Lyndon B. Johnson, was married in the White House East Room in 1967. Her sister, Luci Johnson, held her reception at the White House the year prior, following a ceremony at a nearby church. Tricia Nixon was walked down the aisle in the Rose Garden by her father, Richard Nixon, when she married Edward Cox in 1971.
However, Naomi Biden will follow her most recent predecessor in president-related White House wedding celebrations -- Jenna Bush, daughter of George W. Bush -- by holding only the reception at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Bush married Henry Hager at the Bush family ranch in Crawford, Texas, in May 2008, but her parents later hosted a reception for 600 guests, complete with music by the United States Marine Band, at the White House the following month.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/04/politics/naomi-biden-white-house-wedding-reception/index.html,2022-04-04

CBR,MCU Fans Demand Thor: Love and Thunder Trailer as Chris Hemsworth Begins Press Tour,C,"Marvel Cinematic Universe fans are ready for the Thor: Love and Thunder trailer, and they're making their voices heard.

""Some long lead press for Thor: Love and Thunder with these two wonderful humans,"" Chris Hemsworth wrote on Instagram to accompany a photo of himself, director Taika Waititi and Valkyrie actor Tessa Thompson. ""A day full of wackiness and hilarity. Get ready folks this film's gonna be wild!!"" Perhaps most notable is the comments section of the Instagram post, which is packed to the brim with fans asking and/or demanding the elusive trailer.

With just 95 days until Love and Thunder hits theaters, the trailer is indeed conspicuous by its absence. That it hasn't arrived yet isn't unprecedented, however, considering Waititi confirmed in early March that Thor 4 wasn't done filming. ""It's still not finished,"" he said at the time. ""It comes out in July, so probably the end of June [laughs]. Probably like a day before the premiere [laughs]. That's how we do it."" It was revealed days later that Love and Thunder was undergoing reshoots in the next few weeks.

Love and Thunder picks up after the events of Avengers: Endgame, with the God of Thunder in the company of the Guardians of the Galaxy. At some point, Thor will also reunite with Natalie Portman's Jane Foster, who follows in the footsteps of her comic book counterpart by wielding Mjolnir and becoming Thor in her own right.

""It was really fun,"" Portman explained while discussing bulking up to play Jane. ""I worked with a trainer, Naomi Pendergast, for, I think it was, four months before shooting, and then obviously all the way through filming. We did a lot of weight training and a lot of protein shakes—heavyweight training that I haven’t ever done before. Of course, I’ve never really aimed to get bulky. It was very physical, so it was a lot of both agility work and also strength work. It definitely helps you get into character, and it’s definitely changed the way I move. You walk differently; you feel different. I mean, it’s so wild to feel strong for the first time in my life.""

Following his altercation with Chris Rock at the Oscars, according to data collected by Morning Consult, the public opinion of Smith dropped 30% from a 2020 survey wherein his favorability was listed at 80% overall. Now, Smith's favorability sits at 50%, while Rock has a rating of 60%. Two-thirds of those surveyed also said they found Smith's actions ""inappropriate,"" while one-quarter thought the opposite. 9% had no opinion. On top of that, 49% stated that Smith should have been removed from the ceremony as well, while 36% agreed with him staying.

Along with his plummeting popularity, the incident at the Oscars has also affected Smith's future projects, such as his upcoming Netflix film Fast and Loose and Bad Boys 4, both of which have been put on ""pause"" since the Oscars. The incident may also affect projects produced through Smith's production company, Westbrook. Westbrook was founded in 2019 by Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith and co-produced King Richard, as well as Netflix's Cobra Kai, Peacock's Bel-Air and Pinkett Smith's talk show, Red Table Talk.

""His brand is permanently tarnished in regards to (four-quadrant films, which appeal to all audiences),"" an anonymous Hollywood agent said of Smith. ""This just became his Tom Cruise/Mel Gibson moment, where he's always going to be a star, but he just went from A+ to A and gave people like Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart and Tom Holland a clearer lane.""

While presenting at the Oscars, Rock made a joke about Pinkett Smith's shaved head, wherein he said, ""Jada, I love you-- G.I Jane 2, can't wait to see it."" Pinkett Smith has spoken publically about her struggles with alopecia and Smith, in response to the joke, shocked the audience -- and Rock -- by walking on stage and slapping the comedian across the face.

Smith was later awarded the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in King Richard. In the days following the ceremony, the actor issued a formal apology for the slap, which he called ""unacceptable and inexcusable."" After an enormous amount of backlash, Smith has since resigned from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

""I betrayed the trust of the Academy,"" Smith said in his statement. ""I deprived other nominees and winners of their opportunity to celebrate and be celebrated for their extraordinary work. I am heartbroken."" He continued, ""Change takes time,"" Smith states, ""and I am committed to doing the work to ensure that I never again allow violence to overtake reason.",https://www.cbr.com/will-smith-popularity-drops-after-oscars-slap/,2022-04-05

It was after Miller was released that the incident prompting the restraining order took place. Miller had reportedly been staying with the couple for over a week after the wife met them at a farmer's market. Prior to the bar incident, the couple had been showing Miller around Hilo and they even joined them in running errands.

The Hawai'i Police Department has not commented on the restraining order or the dispute that took place between Miller and the couple. The authorities are currently investigating the matter. Beyond the couple's home, Miller would also be required to refrain from visiting their places of work and would not be allowed to contact them in any form. At the time of writing, Miller and their representatives have not issued a response or provided comment regarding either of the incidents.

Miller is currently attached to two major projects: The Flash, directed by Andy Muschietti; and Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore. Warner Bros. has not responded to the situation surrounding Miller and it is unknown if they will affect their appearances in either project.",https://www.cbr.com/flash-ezra-miller-restraining-order-death-threats/,2022-03-30
CBR,Morbius April Fools' Meme Has Martin Scorsese Praising the Maligned Film,C,"There are Marvel memes aplenty this April Fools' Day, including one that sees director Martin Scorsese singing the praises of Sony Pictures' Spider-Man spinoff Morbius.

The meme features Scorsese standing in front of a Morbius marquis, with the caption reading, ""I was wrong."" This, of course, is in reference to Scorsese's now-infamous comments about Marvel movies, as well as Morbius' critical panning.

""I don’t see them. I tried, you know? But that’s not cinema,"" Scorsese said of Marvel Studios movies in October 2019. ""Honestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks. It isn’t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.""

While Scorsese's remarks were seen as harsh, they pale in comparison to the beating Morbius is taking from critics. At the time of this writing, Morbius has a 15% on Rotten Tomatoes, with the consensus reading, ""Cursed with uninspired effects, rote performances, and a borderline nonsensical story, this Spidey-adjacent mess is a vein attempt to make Morbius happen."" CBR's own review declares that ""With a nonsensical narrative, uneven pacing, and dated special effects and storytelling sensibilities, Morbius is one of the weaker licensed superhero films in recent memory and could derail Sony's plans for their own Marvel shared universe.""

""Morbius is searching for goodness -- the cure for a disease. He's going to find it, disregarding the cost on himself or on society,"" director Daniel Espinosa said of Jared Leto's Michael Morbius. ""And in his search for goodness, he transforms into something he detests. He has to accept the ugliness he has within him, and that there's something beautiful about it. It will be his strength, what makes him unique. Michael Morbius is one of the most altruistic characters of the Marvel Universe. He's one of the few that really believes in good. This good man has a horrible disease, and in his trials to save himself and the people that he cares for, he turns into a monster.""

CBR,Audiences Appear to Be Enjoying Morbius a Lot More Than Critics,C,"Sony Pictures' Morbius is already infamous, despite having been playing in theaters for just a few days. However, it appears that most of the negativity surrounding the film may have come from professional critics and now average moviegoers, who, contrarily, appear to be enjoying the superhero film a lot more.

On review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes, Morbius has a critic score of just 17 percent and an audience score of 70 percent at the time of writing. Where critics abhorred what they described as a confusing and messy plot, several audience reviews expressed a positive reaction to it, though few appear to mention the heavily criticized post-credits scene. Similarly, while many critics found the CGI and special effects to be sub par, many audience reviews praised the VFX.

It's worth mentioning the multitude of memes and ironically positive reviews that appeared on social media around Morbius' release and April Fools' Day, in one way or another, mocking the film. However, the film's negative reputation began prior to its worldwide premiere, with early screenings. Details from those early screenings of Morbius leaked online and allowed audiences to judge the basic premise of certain plot points and the post-credits scene. This was followed by much of the film's second post-credits scene leaking online.

Financially, it appears Morbius is a hit with audiences. The Sony film grossed $39 million in its opening weekend domestically, placing it at no. 1 among current theatrical releases. Since its release on April 1, Morbius has grossed $84 million at the box office worldwide on a budget of $75 million.

The film attempts to build on the concept of the multiverse, which was established in Marvel Studios' Loki series and, more recently, Spider-Man: No Way Home. Morbius' post-credits scene revealed Adrian Toomes, who made his debut in Spider-Man: Homecoming, has left the MCU and entered Sony's Spider-Man Universe, thanks to Doctor Strange's machinations. He and Morbius have evidently teamed up for an unknown reason.

Director Daniel Espinosa recently talked about what their alliance means for the future of the film universe, which will next see Kraven the Hunter.  When asked who he would like Morbius to team up with next, he said, ""I think Norman Osborn would be very interesting. That's a whole different idea, that's like if you go away from the idea of Sinister Six and you're going into something different.""

CBR,The Bubble’s Fred Armisen Dives Into the Fun of Meta-Comedy & Parody,C,"The Bubble, Judd Apatow's newest film, focuses on the disastrous filming process of an in-universe sci-fi action film. While the majority of the film features the actors in the in-universe film Cliff Beasts 6, another part follows  fictional director Darren Eigan as he finds himself tasked with helming the production, managing his cast, and staying ahead of the complications caused by the Pandemic. Playing Eigan with a mix of genuine enthusiasm and consistent exhaustion is Fred Armisen, one of comedy's most impressive chameleons. Armisen juggles the part well, making Eigan simultaneously relatable and bizarre in equal measure.

Ahead of The Bubble's April 1 debut on Netflix, CBR sat down for a conversation with Fred Armisen to discuss the tricky nature of playing a film director who is a character in a completely different film. He also spoke about what makes comedies about the entertainment industry so fun and the central idea he brings to all of his various characters.

CBR: First off, congratulations on The Bubble!

Fred Armisen: Thanks. I really loved doing The Bubble. I got to work here in Britain, so I was really happy about that. I'm sure you're familiar with Judd Apatow's movies, and it's amazing. I love the guy, and I love working in England. I know that the movie is very inside [base]ball. It's inside showbiz, but I think more and more people understand [this industry] more. There used to be a thing of, ""Oh, should we do something that's that inside?"" Now it's opened up a whole bunch. I think with Curb Your Enthusiasm and stuff like that, people just get it.

This is far from your only project poking fun at the industry -- look at something like Documentary Now!, which parodies some of the most famous docs of all time. Why is it so exciting for you, as a comedian, to get to jump into these kinds of parts?

A really quick answer is that it's easy. It's not a stretch. It's all the experiences that are just all around me anyway. So, it's kind of easy and fun. With Documentary Now!, It's stuff that I'm a fan of anyway, so I don't even have to do any research about it. It's just all the stuff that I love and that the writers love. Yeah. Like I said, people are just really... They find all these niche types of entertainment and it seems to work.

In The Bubble, you get to be somewhat removed from the rest of the cast inherently because you're playing Darren Eigan, the director of the in-film movie being produced. What's it like to get to play with the sympathies of a character like that, who may like the cast but can't be necessarily swayed by them?

Well, this might be the movie industry and the TV industry, but I have a feeling everything is like this -- where no one really has any control to do anything. It's all fairly chaotic and all you can do is you can raise a few issues and say, ""I'd like this and that changed."" There's not much you can do. In my time doing this, I feel like directors do have their hands tied. Even though they want to be pushy and they want to be demanding, they're just as quick to be out of a job the next day. It is not a big deal for a studio to say, ""Oh, we're just going to get a different director."" So, there is a thing of, ""I just want to keep my job. I want to keep working, and at the same time, protect the actors or whatever.""  It's a lot of juggling.

What was it like finding the right fun version of a film director to play, and to have a director like Judd Apatow to figure that out with?

It's super weird because I had to take direction, so it's weird to... When you're a director, you've got to say action with conviction and leadership. At the same time, I was more concerned with what Judd thinks. So, it was a weird mix of hearing Judd say, ""Action!"" and then I say, ""Action."" Also, I wanted to deliver. I wanted to be realistic. Some of the research I did was just talking to Judd, just asking him, ""How do you do it? How do you deal with people who are unhappy? How do you deal with that? How do you keep the day going?""

You're also running against the clock. I used to imagine that movies were you just keep filming until it's done. There really is someone looming over saying, ""You have to stop. We can't afford to do anymore."" I think that's the main thing I thought of when I was doing this character.

One of the other fascinating things about the film and the comic draw of it, almost, is really getting to reflect on what being a performer, being in this industry was like during the let's say ""tumultuous"" last couple of years. How would you say the film reflected your own experience in lockdown?

It's really weird. I feel very satisfied with how my work has gone so far, so I didn't feel frustrated. I didn't feel like, ""Oh no, they'll never get to see this thing."" I thought, ""Things that I haven't finished, they'll get completed,"" which they did. Eventually, I'll get to go out and do more standup, but I was kind of okay with it. There were more important things that I felt like... I have my instruments around me. I can play music. I can write. It really did feel like, at some point, this will change, and it's okay. Then, by some miracle, jobs kept coming up. I got to do something else, and then another thing. As a performer, it was okay. I did a whole tour in 2019. I felt like, ""Oh, I did a good..."" I did all my live shows that I didn't mind resting a little.

That is actually the perfect segue into one of your other projects during this period, Our Flag Means Death, which you're also fantastic in.

Oh, I appreciate it. Thanks. Yeah, I was in two or three episodes or something. It's my sweet spot. I love doing that amount in the show. I don't know why. I get to do all the fun stuff, and then that's it. I played opposite Leslie Jones, who was... She's so naturally funny all the time. Even off-camera, when she's just hanging out, it is really like hearing her do stand-up. She's so funny, so great.

Looking back at all your roles over the years -- The Bubble, Our Flag Means Death, SNL, Portlandia, all the countless other parts you've gotten to dive into -- what would you say is the common thread between all your performances?

I just try to like them. I don't ever want to be a character that I don't like.  I just try to make it a part of me, keep it friendly, not lay into it too much -- just keep it kind of natural and do what I'm asked to do, somewhere in there. I think the important thing is that it's not someone I'm making fun of. I like it that these are people I would normally like. Even in Our Flag Means Death, there's a villainous quality to him, but he's really trying his best.

CBR,Razzies Slammed for Bruce Willis-Themed Category in Wake of Aphasia Diagnosis,C,"In the wake of Bruce Willis' aphasia diagnosis, parody award show The Golden Raspberries, often referred to as The Razzies, comes under fire for its Worst Performance by Bruce Willis in a 2021 Movie category.

Following Willis' announcement regarding his retirement from acting, The Razzies' official Twitter account tweeted out support for the iconic action hero. ""The Razzies are truly sorry for #BruceWillis diagnosed condition,"" reads the statement. ""Perhaps this explains why he wanted to go out with a bang in 2021. Our best wishes to Bruce and family."" The tweet received widespread criticism from fans, many of whom are declaring the 2021 category dedicated to Willis heartless and distasteful. The organizers of the award show noted in a follow-up tweet that they were unaware of Willis' diagnosis when they first agreed on giving the actor his own category.

“In light of Mr. Willis’ diagnosis we would like to apologize for our recent category regarding him and his work. We truly believed it was in good fun, but now we recognize it was not. We sincerely apologize to him, his friends, family and fans.”

That took me all of 30 seconds.

In 2021, The Razzies revealed that it was introducing a new once-off category dedicated to Bruce Willis' recent films. The nominated movies included Cosmic Sin, Fortress, American Siege, Deadlock, Midnight in the Switchgrass, Apex, Out of Death and Survive the Game.

Willis recently announced that he will be stepping away from acting following his aphasia diagnosis, a condition that affects one's ability to communicate and speak. The iconic actor's family confirmed that the aphasia has been affecting Willis' cognitive abilities, prompting his retirement. ""This is a really challenging time for our family and we are so appreciative of your continued love, compassion and support,"" wrote Willis' family. ""We are moving through this as a strong family unit, and wanted to bring his fans in because we know how much he means to you, as you do to him.""

Willis is recognized as one of the greatest action movie stars of all time with a career spanning over 44 years. He has appeared in over 117 film and television productions, including Die Hard, The Sixth Sense, Pulp Fiction and The Fifth Element. Willis is also an accomplished musician, releasing several critically-acclaimed blues albums.

Starting in 1981, The Razzies acts as a parody of high-profile awards shows like The Oscars and The Grammys.

ComicBook,Netflix Exec Overseeing TV Dramas Exits the Streamer,C,"Chris Regina, director of original series, drama development at Netflix, has left the streamer. According to Deadline Regina, who had been with Netflix for the past several years, left Netflix last week. In that role, as well as his previous role as director for scripted co-license and original television, Regina oversaw original sci-fi, genre, and thriller series such as Another Life, Wu Assassins, The Order, October Faction, Black Summer, Warrior Nun, and In From the Cold. Deadline's report did not indicate where Regina was going after Netflix.

Regina came to Netflix after two decades at Syfy, where he began working in 1998 as director of scheduling and administration before becoming SVP Program Strategy for Syfy & Chiller. He later became SVP Original Co-Productions, Syfy, USA & Chiller with a focus on original Syfy movies, such as Sharknado as well as the scripted series Z Nation, Van Helsing, Wynonna Earp, and Dark Matter.  Sharknado, which debuted in 2013, was wildly popular and kicked off a full film franchise that would expand to six total films, including not only the original Sharknado but Sharknado 2: The Second One, Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!, Sharknado: The 4th Awakens, Sharknado 5: Global Swarming, and The Last Sharknado: It's About Time.

Outside of Regina's departure from Netflix, there's been some programming news from the streamer recently as well. It was recently reported that, in the wake of Will Smith's altercation with Chris Rock the Oscars, Netflix has put Smith's new film, Fast and Loose, on hold. According to a report from The Hollywood Reporter, after director David Leitch recently backed away from the project, Netflix had planned to find another director to replace him, but after the Oscars incident, they will be letting things cool off before taking on that project again.

The streamer also recently made headlines when they shared some information about their anime stats, revealing that more than half of Netflix's global audience watched anime in the last year and, in Japan, 90 percent of Netflix users have watched anime in the past year.",https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/news/netflix-exec-overseeing-tv-dramas-exits-the-streamer/,2022-04-05

ComicBook,Star Wars Actor Returns to Social Media Following Exit Over Harassment,C,"Star Wars actress Daisy Ridley has officially returned to social media, nearly six years after initially deleting her Instagram account. Ridley, who portrayed Rey Skywalker across the ""sequel trilogy"" of Star Wars films, took to Instagram on Monday to share the news, sharing a photo of herself in a bathrobe drinking tea and holding a saucer. In the caption, Ridley says that she's ""coming out of social media hibernation refreshed, recharged, and ready for what [she's] calling [her] 'Year of Yes.'"" Ridley previously deleted her Instagram in August of 2016, a move that was reportedly due to the abuse that she suffered online.

Back in February of 2021, Ridley told S Moda that she had no plans to return to social media, arguing that while she occasionally found it tempting, the downsides were too apparent.

""I have managed to separate my personal life well from my professional life, partly probably because I'm not on social media,"" Ridley said. ""The statistics that link them (social media sites) to anxiety are terrifying. I have friends completely addicted to their phone who have suffered with this problem.""

""I don't want to go back, but sometimes I think about it,"" Ridley continued. ""But the truth is that no, I won't be returning.""

While Ridley hasn't ruled out the possibility of returning as Rey in a future Star Wars installment, she previously argued to IGN that the narrative of The Rise of Skywalker was her character's ""perfect ending.""

""I think, for me, the beauty of Episode IX is it ends with such hope and such potential. I just feel like that was Rey's perfect ending. The big battle was in Episodes VII, VIII, and IX,"" Ridley shared back in 2020. ""I think really she's probably running around the forest somewhere having a great time [following the events of The Rise of Skywalker].""

""I feel totally, totally satisfied with how that story finished,"" Ridley continued. ""I just don't know what else she could do that I didn't have to do. Also, there are so many amazing characters in Star Wars, that it's sort of an amazing thing. I was watching the new episode of Mandalorian, and it's just like the places it can go beyond even where it is now is so exciting.""",https://comicbook.com/starwars/news/star-wars-actor-daisy-ridley-return-social-media-exit-harassment/,2022-04-05
ComicBook,Morbius Director Daniel Espinosa Comments on Negative Reviews,C,"""Morbius is a superhero vampire movie that really sucks,"" reads one critic's review for director Daniel Espinosa's entry in Sony's Spider-Man Universe starring Jared Leto. The Sony Pictures adaptation of the Marvel Comic book character, which has a 16% rotten on Rotten Tomatoes, has topped the box office with $39 million despite the negative reviews. In a new interview with Insider, Espinosa reacted to Morbius sinking its teeth into a critics' score lower than Venom: Let There Be Carnage (58%), The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (51%), and Venom (30%). 

""When I did my first feature it was a small movie called Babylon Disease. I remember one day going home on the subway and I had a few drinks so I was a bit drunk. Someone nudged me on the train and said, 'I have to tell you what's wrong with the second scene in your feature,' and I was like, 'Well, okay,'"" Espinosa told Insider when asked about critical reviews. ""The point I'm making is that it's a strange thing to make something that is so public."" 

Espinosa added, ""Look, I have a lot of self-hatred, so I have a lot of criticism of my own work. I'm always trying to focus on being better. But I am also proud of what I do. There are parts in all of my movies that I'm really proud of."" 

Filmed in early 2019 and released three years later — Morbius moved off its original July 10, 2020 date six times, in part because of the COVID-19 pandemic — did Espinosa's movie miss its window? 

""Maybe,"" the director said. I mean, when I did Life, all I heard was I had to be before the next Alien movie came out [2017's Alien: Covenant]."" 

Espinosa explained, ""Because, after that movie came out, people wouldn't want to see another movie with aliens. But to me, it doesn't matter. At the end of the day, the movie is the movie. As the years go by, no one remembers when it came out, just that it exists."" 

Fans and critics alike have not taken a liking to Leto's Living Vampire, including Spencer Perry's one-star review for ComicBook.

Bleeding Cool,Shrinking: Harrison Ford Joins Jason Segel on Apple TV+ Comedy Series,C,"Harrison Ford will be playing a shrink, co-starring with lead Jason Segel in Shrinking, Apple TV+'s 10-episode comedy series written and executive produced by Segel and Ted Lasso's co-creator/executive producer/showrunner Bill Lawrence and star/writer/producer Brett Goldstein, who also stars in Ted Lasso as everyone's favourite foul-mouthed footballer Roy Kent. This marks Ford's first TV starring role.

The Warner Bros. Television-produced Shrinking follows a grieving therapist (Segel) who starts to break the rules and tell his clients exactly what he thinks. Ignoring his training and ethics, he finds himself making huge, tumultuous changes to people's lives…including his own. In other words, just like every other TV show about a character who faces a life-changing situation and decides, ""F*** it!"" and decides to throw a spanner in everything and everyone to make a change. This sounds like a role tailor-made for Jason Segel.

Ford, who is joining Shrinking after lengthy negotiations, will play Dr. Phil Rhodes, a down-to-earth, sharp as a tack ""blue-collar shrink,"" blunt but with an ever-present twinkle. Of course, he does. Phil is a pioneer in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy who has built a successful practice over the years that he shares with his two young proteges, Jimmy and Gaby. Fiercely independent (is there such a thing as a single character in movies or TV whose independence is ever less than ""fierce""? Honest!), Phil has recently been diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease, which forces him out of his comfort zone as he grapples with intrusive friends, his estranged family (of course he has an estranged family – where's the drama if a therapist hero on a TV show had a loving, non-estranged family?) and his legacy. Sounds like the show will be about the hero finally deciding to tell the annoying people in his life to F*** off. That's pretty much a textbook ""why now?"" of a TV series.

Shrinking is produced by Warner Bros. Television and Lawrence's studio-based Doozer Productions. Segel, Lawrence, and Goldstein will executive produce alongside Doozer's Jeff Ingold and Liza Katzer.",https://bleedingcool.com/tv/shrinking-harrison-ford-joins-jason-segel-on-apple-tv-comedy-series/,2022-04-04
