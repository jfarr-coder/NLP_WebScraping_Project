The image file format has been a defining element of internet culture for decades, with glass-raising DiCaprios and mic-dropping Obamas facilitating self-expression in a faceless digital world. And we have one man to thank for all the jokes, snark and praise: Stephen Wilhite, inventor of the gif, who died last week, aged 74.Wilhite, who lived in Milford, Ohio, contracted Covid two weeks before his death, his wife, Kathaleen Wilhite, told NPR.A lifelong coder, Stephen Wilhite created the gif in 1987 while working at CompuServe. The compressed image files were useful at a time when internet connections dragged. “If you want lossless, compressed graphics, there is nothing better than gif,” said Sandy Trevor, who managed Wilhite’s team, to the Daily Dot in 2012.Steve Wilhite attends the Webby awards in New York in 2013. His wife, Kathaleen Wilhite, said creating the gif was his proudest achievement. Photograph: Stephen Lovekin/Getty ImagesWilhite “invented gif all by himself – he actually did that at home and brought it into work after he perfected it”, said Kathaleen Wilhite to the Verge. “He would figure out everything privately in his head and then go to town programming it on the computer.” It was his proudest achievement, she said.The same year, an update led to animated graphics. “I think the first gif was a picture of a plane. It was a long time ago,” Stephen Wilhite told the Daily Dot in 2012. Indeed, according to Giphy, the go-to site for gif seekers, it was this image:Wilhite worked for Compuserve until 2001, after he had a stroke. Meanwhile, gifs’ popularity took off, including on early social media sites such as MySpace. By 1996, the “dancing baby” image – one of Wilhite’s favorites, he told the New York Times – was plastered across the the web and attached to emails. In 2012, “gif” was dubbed word of the year by Oxford American Dictionaries. The next year, the New York Times called the format “the aesthetic calling card of modern Internet culture”.That year, Wilhite received a Webby lifetime achievement award. Called to the stage, he maintained a poker face as he delivered an acceptance “speech” in an appropriate format:Wilhite continued to code for the rest of his life. He was also passionate about model trains, Kathaleen Wilhite told NPR, and the couple were avid campers; he “loved travelling”, his obituary says. Beyond his work and his hobbies, “he was probably one of the kindest, humble men you’ve ever met,” Kathaleen Wilhite told the radio network. “People loved him and respected his work, and that would mean more to him than anything is how they respected what he did … I miss him more than anyone could imagine.”Tributes poured in on his obituary page. “You changed the way we converse as a society, and immortalized countless moments that would otherwise be fleeting,” wrote one well-wisher. “Thank you for helping the modern world take shape,” wrote another.Giphy offered a tribute of its own, hailing “the simplicity of the format, the power of the looping image. We are indebted to the creativity and vision of Mr Wilhite.”For those who’d like to honor Wilhite’s memory themselves, there are plenty of gifs that pay tribute to their inventor. Perhaps even better, you can heed his unequivocal advice: pronounce it “jif”.TopicsTechnologyInternetArtOhiofeaturesReuse this contentMost popularMost popularUSWorldEnvironmentSoccerUS PoliticsBusinessTechScienceNewslettersFight to voteNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usContact usComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2022 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: David Kelly/Photograph David KellyDamian Carrington Environment editor@dpcarringtonThu 24 Mar 2022 07.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Mar 2022 05.47 EDTMicroplastic pollution has been detected in human blood for the first time, with scientists finding the tiny particles in almost 80% of the people tested.The discovery shows the particles can travel around the body and may lodge in organs. The impact on health is as yet unknown. But researchers are concerned as microplastics cause damage to human cells in the laboratory and air pollution particles are already known to enter the body and cause millions of early deaths a year.Huge amounts of plastic waste are dumped in the environment and microplastics now contaminate the entire planet, from the summit of Mount Everest to the deepest oceans. People were already known to consume the tiny particles via food and water as well as breathing them in, and they have been found in the faeces of babies and adults.The scientists analysed blood samples from 22 anonymous donors, all healthy adults and found plastic particles in 17. Half the samples contained PET plastic, which is commonly used in drinks bottles, while a third contained polystyrene, used for packaging food and other products. A quarter of the blood samples contained polyethylene, from which plastic carrier bags are made.“Our study is the first indication that we have polymer particles in our blood – ​it’s a breakthrough result,” said Prof Dick Vethaak, an ecotoxicologist at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in the Netherlands. “But we have to extend the research and increase the sample sizes, the number of polymers assessed, etc.” Further studies by a number of groups are already under way, he said.“It is certainly reasonable to be concerned,” Vethaak told the Guardian. “The particles are there and are transported throughout the body.” He said previous work had shown that microplastics were 10 times higher in the faeces of babies compared with adults and that babies fed with plastic bottles are swallowing millions of microplastic particles a day.“We also know in general that babies and young children are more vulnerable to chemical and particle exposure,” he said. “That worries me a lot.”The new research is published in the journal Environment International and adapted existing techniques to detect and analyse particles as small as 0.0007mm. Some of the blood samples contained two or three types of plastic. The team used steel syringe needles and glass tubes to avoid contamination, and tested for background levels of microplastics using blank samples.Vethaak acknowledged that the amount and type of plastic varied considerably between the blood samples. “But this is a pioneering study,” he said, with more work now needed. He said the differences might reflect short-term exposure before the blood samples were taken, such as drinking from a plastic-lined coffee cup, or wearing a plastic face mask.“The big question is what is happening in our body?” Vethaak said. “Are the particles retained in the body? Are they transported to certain organs, such as getting past the blood-brain barrier?” And are these levels sufficiently high to trigger disease? We urgently need to fund further research so we can find out.”The new research was funded by the Dutch National Organisation for Health Research and Development and Common Seas, a social enterprise working to reduce plastic pollution.“Plastic production is set to double by 2040,” said Jo Royle, founder of the charity Common Seas. “We have a right to know what all this plastic is doing to our bodies.” Common Seas, along with more than 80 NGOs, scientists and MPs, are asking the UK government to allocate £15m to research on the human health impacts of plastic. The EU is already funding research on the impact of microplastic on foetuses and babies, and on the immune system.A recent study found that microplastics can latch on to the outer membranes of red blood cells and may limit their ability to transport oxygen. The particles have also been found in the placentas of pregnant women, and in pregnant rats they pass rapidly through the lungs into the hearts, brains and other organs of the foetuses.A new review paper published on Tuesday, co-authored by Vethaak, assessed cancer risk and concluded: “More detailed research on how micro- and nano-plastics affect the structures and processes of the human body, and whether and how they can transform cells and induce carcinogenesis, is urgently needed, particularly in light of the exponential increase in plastic production. The problem is becoming more urgent with each day.”TopicsPlasticsPollutionHealthReuse this contentMost popularMost popularEnvironmentClimate crisisWildlifeEnergyPollutionGreen lightNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usContact usComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2022 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

This is where officials from the city’s police, military and local government are meeting, planning and monitoring the war.Gen. Andrea Kryshenko and Gen. Serhii Knyazev said Wednesday that Ukraine regained significant territory around Kyiv in the past two days — a potential sign that the war, which enters the second month, could undergo a shift as Russian forces struggle to advance on the country's capital.A U.S. defense official corroborated the claim, saying that the Russian military had pushed from the east to as close as 12 miles from Kyiv. After the counteroffensive, those forces had retreated to about 34 miles away from the city, the official added.But some military experts have cautioned that it's hard to tell whether the gains Ukraine claims to have made in the past 48 hours are real. Even if they are, they say, the coming days will be incredibly important as Putin could deploy even more lethal weapons in his bid to break Kyiv's defenses and as Ukraine struggles to hold the southern port city of Mariupol.Read the full story here.Share this -4 Eastern European nations call for blocking of Russian transport routesErik Ortiz5d ago / 3:49 PM UTCThe leaders of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland said in a joint letter Thursday that the European Union must be more aggressive against Russia, calling on the union of member nations to prohibit road freight transport with Russia and Belarus, as well as block those countries' vessels from entering European Union ports.""As the transport sector is international by its very nature, we believe that measures in both modes need to be adopted simultaneously at the EU level in order to be truly effective,"" the leaders wrote.""We must together put maximum pressure on Russia to stop the war,"" they added.

This is where officials from the city’s police, military and local government are meeting, planning and monitoring the war.Gen. Andrea Kryshenko and Gen. Serhii Knyazev said Wednesday that Ukraine regained significant territory around Kyiv in the past two days — a potential sign that the war, which enters the second month, could undergo a shift as Russian forces struggle to advance on the country's capital.A U.S. defense official corroborated the claim, saying that the Russian military had pushed from the east to as close as 12 miles from Kyiv. After the counteroffensive, those forces had retreated to about 34 miles away from the city, the official added.But some military experts have cautioned that it's hard to tell whether the gains Ukraine claims to have made in the past 48 hours are real. Even if they are, they say, the coming days will be incredibly important as Putin could deploy even more lethal weapons in his bid to break Kyiv's defenses and as Ukraine struggles to hold the southern port city of Mariupol.Read the full story here.Share this -4 Eastern European nations call for blocking of Russian transport routesErik Ortiz5d ago / 3:49 PM UTCThe leaders of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland said in a joint letter Thursday that the European Union must be more aggressive against Russia, calling on the union of member nations to prohibit road freight transport with Russia and Belarus, as well as block those countries' vessels from entering European Union ports.""As the transport sector is international by its very nature, we believe that measures in both modes need to be adopted simultaneously at the EU level in order to be truly effective,"" the leaders wrote.""We must together put maximum pressure on Russia to stop the war,"" they added.

Before the pandemic, 71 percent of respondents said they received less harassment or no abuse at all. Researchers reported personal insults and attacks on their professional capabilities as the most common types of harassment. Other types of abuse — such as threats of harm, physical intimidation and doxxing — were reported more rarely. Eighteen scientists — about 3.5 percent of those surveyed — said they received death threats. Scientists with public stances on politicized topics — including those against the use of the drug ivermectin — were more likely to experience harassment, the Science analysis suggested. Science asked nearly 9,600 researchers for their perspective, and it’s possible the results are skewed by those who chose to respond. Marking two years of the Covid-19 pandemicMarch 12, 202202:36Harassment of researchers and public health officials during the pandemic has become a growing concern and a focus for professional organizations.A survey by Nature, which included responses from 321 researchers who discussed Covid-19 in the media, found that 81 percent reported receiving personal attacks, 22 percent had received threats of physical or sexual violence and 15 percent received death threats.A Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health study published last week found widespread reports of harassment among local public health departments. In survey data collected by the National Association of County and City Health Officials, researchers found 57 percent of health departments reported harassment during the first 11 months of the pandemic, with 1,499 unique cases reported. Evan BushEvan Bush is a science reporter for NBC News.

The banner was made for a march of several hundred Native American activists and supporters from San Francisco to Washington, D.C., in 1978.Allison Zaucha for NBC NewsLink copiedMarch 24, 2022, 8:42 AM UTCBy Erik OrtizLeonard Peltier, the Native American activist who has been imprisoned for nearly half a century for the murders of two FBI agents he has always maintained he didn't commit, is hopeful he'll have a chance to clear his name before he dies. Peltier, 77, wants President Joe Biden to review his case and grant him clemency so he won't die in prison. He's not looking for a presidential pardon, because it would be granted for a crime he insists he is innocent of. Instead, he wants a new trial. “If I get into court, if the judge is fair, how are they going to answer all of that?” he said of evidence that was withheld from the 1977 proceedings. “I want to get a trial.""Recent calls from Peltier's supporters and family for him to be released have noted his failing health, including a recent bout of Covid-19.  ""They're going to try and make me die here,"" Peltier said by phone Wednesday from his federal prison in Central Florida, his first media interview since 2016. ""I have a last few years, and I got to fight.""Peltier's family says he is struggling with diabetes, hypertension, partial blindness from a stroke and an abdominal aortic aneurysm and that he tested positive for Covid in late January at the Federal Correctional Complex Coleman’s high-security facility.Peltier said he was vaccinated against the coronavirus before he tested positive and that his chest, neck and head had hurt for a few days. He got a booster shot after he left 10 days of quarantine, he said.The roughest part, he said, was being isolated and not receiving adequate care. He felt ""cold,"" and ""the food was bad,"" he said, adding, ""That was worse than getting Covid.""Leonard Peltier and his son Chauncey during a visit in prison in 2015. Courtesy of Chauncey PeltierHaving spent years in prison mulling over his case and the various legal rulings, Peltier said there is evidence he'd like to present to show he didn't fire the bullets that killed the agents in a chaotic shootout on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota in June 1975.""My lawyer said if I were tried today, they would never get away with it,"" he said.His attorney, Kevin Sharp, a former federal judge, said Peltier has exhausted his appeals and that there remains no actual process for him to get a new trial unless federal prosecutors decide to reopen the case.""They wouldn't do that, because there's no evidence to convict him on,"" Sharp said. ""He was convicted on aiding and abetting murder, but who did he aid and abet? His co-defendants were acquitted based on self-defense.""Over the decades, criminal justice reform advocates have continued to highlight his arrest and conviction, saying it symbolizes systemic problems with how Native Americans are treated in the justice system, as well as imprisoned at higher rates by the federal government compared to other racial groups.Human rights organizations and prominent political and religious figures, including Pope Francis and the Dalai Lama and other Nobel Peace Prize recipients, such as Nelson Mandela and Bishop Desmond Tutu, are reported to have called for Peltier's release.Biden: Criminal justice reform will be 'enormous focus' of administrationMay 2, 202005:03Peltier's case has drawn scrutiny from those living on the Pine Ridge reservation, as well as members of his tribe, the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa. Other Native American activists and groups also believe Peltier is innocent and was made a scapegoat by the federal government in its pursuit to hold someone accountable for the agents' deaths.But he has consistently been denied parole — in 2009, federal prosecutors said he was ""an unrepentant, cold-blooded murderer"" — and he isn't eligible again until 2024. In October, 11 members of Congress petitioned the Biden administration to grant clemency based on compassionate grounds.Rep. Raúl Grijalva, D-Ariz., a clemency supporter, said he spoke with Peltier by phone after he learned Peltier had Covid. Grijalva's office said last month that Peltier described ""difficulties receiving adequate medical attention and gaining access to basic needs, like water.""The Justice Department's Bureau of Prisons declined to comment on Peltier's case, citing privacy and security reasons. It said that it makes ""every effort"" to ensure the safety of inmates and that at Coleman, every inmate is given access to drinking water, adequate medical care and food.Sharp said he believes Peltier's age, health and recent illness make him a prime candidate for release and that his clean and nonviolent prison record also indicates he isn't a threat to the public.The number of inmates with Covid at federal prisons reached its peak around the time Peltier contracted the coronavirus, with close to 10,000 of them testing positive, according to Justice Department data. Active cases have dropped to about 100 this week, but Sharp believes Peltier is still at risk.""Leonard Peltier is incapable of protecting himself. And if you're not going to do it, BOP, let him go home,"" Sharp said, referring to the Bureau of Prisons. ""This is where justice and mercy meet. Grant him clemency and send him home.""Coleman Federal Prison in Florida in 2010.Reinhold Matay / AP fileIt's unclear how familiar Biden is with Peltier's case, which has spawned hundreds of pages of FBI files; several books, including his own memoir, published in 1999; and the 1992 documentary ""Incident at Oglala,"" which was narrated by Robert Redford.The FBI said in a statement Thursday that it remains ""resolute against the commutation of Leonard Peltier's sentence"" and that ""we must never forget or put aside that Peltier intentionally and mercilessly murdered these two young men and has never expressed remorse for his ruthless actions.""The White House did not respond to a request for comment.Asked in January whether Biden was reviewing a request to commute Peltier's sentence, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters, ""I don't have anything to predict for you.""In recent weeks, Democrats have tried to appeal to Biden. The Democratic National Committee's Native American Caucus wrote in a letter last week that Peltier's continued incarceration ""symbolizes the decades-old racial injustice towards Native Americans,""  HuffPost reported.The encounter that led Peltier to prison involved a pair of FBI agents, Jack Coler and Ron Williams, who went onto a compound on the Pine Ridge reservation to arrest a man on a federal warrant in connection with the theft of a pair of cowboy boots, according to the agency's investigative files.Leonard Peltier, American Indian Movement leader, is led across Oakalla Prison to a waiting helicopter, on Dec. 17, 1976, on Burnaby, British Columbia.Bettmann ArchivePeltier was a member of the American Indian Movement, a grassroots activist organization that began in Minneapolis in the 1960s to challenge police brutality and the oppression of Native Americans' rights. He was at Pine Ridge in 1975 in the wake of a drawn-out protest two years earlier at Wounded Knee, South Dakota, where armed American Indian Movement activists and Oglala Sioux tribal members had occupied the town and clashed with federal law enforcement officers. Two activists were killed.On the day Coler and Williams were at Pine Ridge, they radioed that they had come under fire. It's unclear who pulled the trigger first; the FBI said the men were in a shootout that lasted 10 minutes. Both men were killed by bullets fired at close range. According to the FBI, Peltier was identified as the only person in possession of a weapon that could fire the type of bullet that killed them.Dozens of people participated in the gunfight; at trial, two co-defendants were acquitted after they claimed self-defense. When Peltier was tried separately in 1977, no witnesses were presented who could identify him as the shooter, and unbeknown to his defense lawyers at the time, the federal government had withheld a ballistics report indicating the fatal bullets didn't come from his weapon, Sharp said.""My co-defendants were found not guilty in self-defense, and I'm the one doing all this time,"" Peltier said.The FBI maintains his conviction was ""rightly and fairly obtained"" and ""has withstood numerous appeals to multiple courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court.""The incident is seen as an emblematic struggle between Native Americans and the federal government, particularly on Indigenous lands, and it has long rankled Indigenous activists who say the killing of a Native American man in the shootout was never formally investigated.Over the years, former FBI agents have pushed back against Peltier's claim of innocence and bid for clemency. When Peltier's family sought help from President Bill Clinton, then-FBI Director Louis Freeh wrote in a letter that ""ignoring for a moment, the extreme and remorseless brutality of the acts themselves, our employees see Peltier's crimes as a complete affront to our cherished system of government under the rule of law.""In a rare public demonstration by members of the FBI, about 500 active and retired agents and staff members marched to the White House to protest any action by Clinton.But last year, retired federal prosecutor James Reynolds, who supervised Peltier's post-trial sentencing and appeals, broke from the federal government's position. He wrote in a letter to Biden that ""we were not able to prove that Mr. Peltier personally committed any offense on the Pine Ridge Reservation."" He also underscored a long-held belief that Peltier was treated differently at the time because of a ""broken relationship between Native Americans and the government"" and that he was prosecuted with ""minimal evidence"" that ""I strongly doubt would be upheld in any court today.""Peltier said Wednesday he was grateful for Reynolds' letter.""If I could say to him: 'Thank you for finally coming forward. ... I thank you for your courage, and I hope that you can prevent this from ever happening to anyone else.'""Two of Peltier's adult children said in interviews that they would like a meeting with the White House now so Biden can understand his case and why they believe his release is warranted.""I know that Joe and Jill Biden are compassionate to the Native peoples,"" said his daughter Kathy Peltier, who lives in Los Angeles. ""I think seeing the family would make them see him as a real person, and we can explain what he's facing so it hits a little harder for them.""Chauncey Peltier holds Leonard's great-grandson Brayden Rand.Courtesy of Chauncey PeltierKathy Peltier said she had been hopeful that past administrations would listen. But the presidencies of Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump came and went. In December 2016, Leonard Peltier's youngest son, Wahacanka Paul Shields-Peltier, died on a trip to Washington, D.C., advocating for his father's release. He was 41. He died in the waning days of Obama's second term, when the family remained optimistic that the president would grant Peltier clemency.With the loss of her brother and the realization that her father would never get to see him again, Kathy Peltier was in shock.Kathy Peltier said that on the day Obama left office after having commuted hundreds of sentences — by far the most of any recent president — she turned off her phone and refused to leave her bedroom.""I shut out the world,"" she said.Kathy Peltier, 46, has known her father only as a federal prisoner. She said it has been difficult to come to terms with how he has missed out on his family's lives. He has six surviving children and a dozen great-grandchildren.Peltier's oldest son, Chauncey Peltier, 56, who lives in Oregon, previously saw his father in 2015, when he visited him in prison. To channel his emotions, Leonard Peltier took up oil painting featuring Native American themes and iconography.""The family prays every day and hopes he gets to go home, but some of us aren't hopeful it will ever happen,"" he said.

But, he said, the art studio will be opening up again, and he hopes to pick up a brush in the next week.To all of his supporters, including those who have helped with his legal defense, he said, he is thankful they haven't forgotten him and hopes their messages to the White House are heard.""One of the elders, when I was convicted and I was going to leave the courtroom, she stood by the railing and said: 'They don't know who they did this to. We will be here the rest of our lives,'"" Peltier said. ""And they have been.""I would love to go home,"" he added. ""My family wants to take care of me.

I will vote against this nominee on the Senate floor,” he said.The Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to vote on Jackson's nomination April 4, setting up a likely vote in the full Senate later in the month. No Democratic-voting senators have indicated they would oppose her.McConnell had not been expected to back President Joe Biden's historic pick — he voted against Jackson's nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for Washington, D.C., last year — but Thursday's announcement could open the floodgates for other GOP senators to follow suit and potentially set up a party-line vote for Jackson, who would be the first Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court.The Senate confirmed Jackson last year to her current post by a vote of 53-44, with support from just three Republicans: Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.Graham, however, was openly antagonistic toward Jackson at her confirmation hearings this week, criticizing her sentencings in child pornography cases.Graham, who has yet to reveal how he plans to vote, said Thursday, ""I'm inclined to vote for nominees,"" but suggested he might hold Jackson to different standard for the Supreme Court than he did for the federal appeals court. ""I thought she was qualified to be on the circuit court. This is a different game,"" he said.Asked whether that meant he would vote against her, Graham said, “Now just stay tuned.""Dareh GregorianDareh Gregorian is a politics reporter for NBC News.Frank Thorp V and Garrett Haake contributed.AboutContactHelpCareersAd ChoicesPrivacy policyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCA NoticeTerms of ServiceNBC NEWS SITEMAPAdvertise© 2022 NBC UNIVERSALNBC News LogoMSNBC LogoToday Logo",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/mcconnell-vote-jacksons-supreme-court-nomination-rcna21460,3/24/2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Doug Ducey, who has signed every piece of anti-abortion legislation that has reached his desk since he took office in 2015.Arizona reproductive health, rights and justice advocates protest an abortion bill at the Arizona Capitol in Phoenix on April 26.Ross D. Franklin / AP fileLink copiedMarch 24, 2022, 10:08 PM UTCBy The Associated PressPHOENIX — The Arizona Legislature on Thursday joined the growing list of Republican-led states to pass aggressive anti-abortion legislation as the conservative U.S. Supreme Court is considering ratcheting back abortion rights that have been in place for nearly 50 years.The House voted on party lines to outlaw abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, mirroring a Mississippi law now being considered by the nation’s high court.The bill explicitly says it does not overrule a state law in place for more than 100 years that would ban abortion outright if the Supreme Court overrules Roe v. Wade, the 1973 case that enshrined the right to abortion in law.The bill now goes to Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, an abortion opponent who has signed every piece of anti-abortion legislation that has reached his desk since he took office in 2015.Florida lawmakers have passed a similar 15-week abortion ban early this month that Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis is expected to sign. A bill in West Virginia failed to pass the state Senate by the time its legislative session ended earlier this month after passing the House.An Arizona proposal that would outlaw abortion after about six weeks has not advanced. A bill enacted in Texas last year allows private citizens to enforce the ban, and the Supreme Court refused to block it. Idaho’s governor signed a copycat bill this week. Those measures are unique in that they allow private citizens to file civil lawsuits against anyone who helps someone else get an abortion after six weeks. It has made legal challenges difficult because the government is not involved in enforcement.Idaho bans abortions after six weeks as Oklahoma, Florida work on similar lawsMarch 24, 202201:33The Arizona 15-week abortion ban bill contains no exceptions for rape or incest or for a medical emergency.“I am becoming more frightened by the moment by this bill,” Democratic Rep. Mitzi Epstein said during Thursday’s floor debate. “I’m terrified that this bill would outlaw health care for a woman having a naturally occurring and tragic and horrible miscarriage and they would not be allowed to get this health care.”Republican backers said little during the floor debate.Minority Democrats have said the measure is unconstitutional and that any ban would disproportionately impact poor and minority women who won’t be able to travel to states without strict abortion laws.But Sen. Nancy Barto, the Republican sponsor of the bill, has said she hopes the high court upholds Mississippi’s law banning abortion after 15 weeks.“The state has an obligation to protect life, and that is what this bill is about,” Barto said during Senate debate last month.The debate and vote on the 15-week abortion ban came the same morning that the House also debated a ban on transgender girls from playing on the high school or college sports team that aligns with their gender identity. The House voted Thursday to pass a bill banning gender reassignment surgery for anyone younger than 18.Arizona already has some of the nation’s most restrictive abortion laws, including one that would automatically outlaw it if the high court fully overturns Roe.Republicans hope to put the 15-week ban in place so it takes effect quickly if the Supreme Court further limits abortion rights but stops short of fully overturning Roe. The measure closely mirrors the Mississippi law.Under current abortion rulings, abortion is legal until the point a fetus can survive outside the womb, which is usually around 24 weeks.Barto’s bill would make it a crime for a doctor to perform an abortion after 15 weeks but would prohibit the prosecution of pregnant people for receiving one. Doctors could face felony charges and lose their license to practice medicine. There is an exception for cases when the mother is at risk of death or serious permanent injury, but not for instances of rape or incest.Of the 13,186 abortions performed in Arizona in 2020, 636 were after 15 weeks of pregnancy, according to the latest data from the Arizona Department of Health Services.The Associated PressAboutContactHelpCareersAd ChoicesPrivacy policyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCA NoticeTerms of ServiceNBC NEWS SITEMAPAdvertise© 2022 NBC UNIVERSALNBC News LogoMSNBC LogoToday Logo",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/arizona-legislature-passes-15-week-abortion-ban-rcna21478,3/24/2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He said the state violated his religious rights by refusing to let his pastor pray audibly with him or perform a tradition known as the laying-on of hands.  The state’s refusal, the court said, meant Ramirez “will be unable to engage in protected religious exercise in the final moments of his life.”The 8-1 decision was written by Chief Justice John Roberts and joined by all but Clarence Thomas, who said Ramirez was merely trying to “'manipulate the judicial process' to win further delay” in carrying out the death sentence.Texas allows spiritual advisers to pray with and counsel an inmate until the prisoner is taken into the lethal injection chamber. Preventing them from speaking or touching an inmate from that point on preserved the execution team’s ability to detect signs of distress, the state said.But the court said the state’s categorial ban was too restrictive. Supreme Court blocks execution of Texas man who asked for pastor to pray with him in the death chamberSept. 9, 202101:32“We do not see how letting the spiritual advisor stand slightly closer, reach out his arm, and touch part of the prisoner’s body well away from the side of any IV line would meaningfully increase risk,” Roberts wrote.Roberts cited a history of clerical prayer at the time of an execution, from the early 1700s in England to the execution of conspirators in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, and to the execution of Nazi war criminals after World War II.In recent years, the Supreme Court has been receptive to claims that states improperly denied the religious freedom of inmates facing the death penalty. It blocked a scheduled execution in 2019 of another Texas inmate who said his religious freedom was violated because his Buddhist spiritual adviser wasn’t allowed to be with him.In response, Texas banned all spiritual advisers from the execution chamber. Then in 2020, the Supreme Court stayed the execution of a Texas inmate challenging the no-advisers policy, so the state changed its policy again but retained the prohibition on praying aloud or touching. Ramirez said that both he and his pastor believed that people either ascend to heaven or descend to damnation at the moment of death. He contended that denying him the traditional ministrations by his pastor violated his religious freedom.Texas said its protocol balanced many factors, including maintaining uniformity in executions to reduce the opportunity for errors, protecting the safety and privacy of execution personnel and the rights of the inmate, and providing closure for the victim’s family and the community.Nine states — Arizona, Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, Montana, South Dakota and Utah — urged the court to side with Texas. “The safety and security of state execution protocols should not be subject to federal court micromanagement,” they said in a friend-of-court brief. But several religious organizations, including the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, said the Texas prohibition burdens the religious freedom not only of inmates, but also of their pastors in carrying out key actions of the ministry. Ramirez was sentenced to death for fatally stabbing a man 29 times during a convenience store robbery following a drug binge. He fled to Mexico but was later arrested and brought back for trial.In the Supreme Court, he did not seek to challenge either his conviction or his death sentence. Pete WilliamsPete Williams is an NBC News correspondent who covers the Justice Department and the Supreme Court, based in Washington.AboutContactHelpCareersAd ChoicesPrivacy policyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCA NoticeTerms of ServiceNBC NEWS SITEMAPAdvertise© 2022 NBC UNIVERSALNBC News LogoMSNBC LogoToday Logo",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-says-spiritual-advisers-can-touch-prisoners-time-executi-rcna21374,3/24/2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Photograph: DeFodi Images/Getty ImagesReutersThu 24 Mar 2022 18.12 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Mar 2022 04.44 EDTItaly missed out on the World Cup finals again after losing 1-0 at home to North Macedonia in their playoff semi-final as Aleksandar Trajkovski’s last-gasp strike earned the visitors a famous win.Italy did not qualify for the World Cup four years ago, missing out for the first time since 1958, but the European champions dominated from the off in Palermo. The hosts became more desperate in their search for a winner after the break, however, as chances continued to come and go before, in stoppage time, Trajkovski arrowed in a stunning winner to spark wild North Macedonian celebrations.‘Destroyed and crushed’: Italy stunned after missing out on World Cup againRead moreRoberto Mancini’s Italy side had 32 efforts at goal in the match but somehow fell short, with North Macedonia going on to play Portugal in the playoff final on Tuesday for a place in Qatar.“It is a huge disappointment,” the Italy midfielder Jorginho said. “It hurts, it hurts so much. We have always created and dominated matches but we have not been able to finish teams off. It is not to blame anyone in particular but it is the reality.“I don’t know why we haven’t been able to do this, I am also involved in this, and it hurts me to think about it.”Without the veteran pairing Leonardo Bonucci and Giorgio Chiellini through injury, Italy’s makeshift defence was barely troubled in the first half, as all the action took place down the other end.João Pedro reacts after Italy’s last chance to equalise. Photograph: Antonio Calanni/APDomenico Berardi had the best of the openings, having been presented with the ball after the North Macedonia goalkeeper Stole Dimitrievski misplaced a pass, but his shot was tame, with Dimitrievski getting back to make the save. Ciro Immobile also wasted a glorious first-half chance for Italy when blazing over the bar from a good position.Berardi was again guilty of profligacy after the break, shooting over when he should have hit the target, and with their only meaningful attack of the match North Macedonia seized their chance. Italy did not look to be in too much danger, but Trajkovski, who plays in Saudi Arabia for Al-Fayha, wrote his name into North Macedonian football folklore with a shot that crept inside the post to stun the home fans.

But Fernando Santos’s side were pegged back by a Yilmaz goal in the 65th minute that put the Portuguese fans on the edge of their seats as Turkey started to threaten.Gareth Bale’s brilliance gives Wales World Cup playoff win over AustriaRead moreJosé Fonte then fouled Enes Unal inside the area in the 85th minute to concede a penalty given by VAR but Yilmaz fired it high over the bar. The Portugal substitute Matheus Nunes relieved the pressure on the hosts in added time with their third goal from a counterattack.The Sweden substitute Robin Quaison struck in the second half of extra time to secure a 1-0 win over the Czech Republic and set up a clash away to Poland.The Czechs had an early goal ruled out for a foul and the Swedes had the lion’s share of possession for most of the playoff semi-final, but the two sides struggled to break each other down in a game full of tough tackling and wayward passing.The substitute Mattias Svanberg went closest for the Swedes in normal time, but his header from Emil Forsberg’s corner was aimed straight at the visiting goalkeeper Tomas Vaclik.The game finished scoreless after 90 minutes and appeared to be heading for penalties when Quaison danced through the middle of the defence before exchanging passes with Alexander Isak and coolly slotting home to move his side a step closer to Qatar.

On Thursday night, co-CEO of The Daily Wire Jeremy Boreing sat down live in-studio for an interview with Tim Pool, popular podcaster and host of TimCast IRL, to discuss The Daily Wire’s latest venture — Jeremy’s Razors, a new company launched by The Daily Wire in response to Harry’s razors pulling its advertising from The Daily Wire in 2021. Boreing also talked about the success of Jeremy’s Razors, announcing that the company had sold 25,000 razor subscriptions in just three days.Jeremy’s Razors also released a multi-million dollar marketing campaign, and its first ad, which features the McLaren-driving “god-king” Boreing walking through The Daily Wire’s headquarters and torching a pack of Harry’s razors. It has received more than one million views on Twitter.The ad also caught the eye of Pool, who praised the ad as “one of the funniest commercials ever.” He added that the whole idea was “brilliant” and that “The Daily Wire knows the power of culture” during a segment of his podcast.On Thursday, Pool had Boreing on Timcast IRL to discuss Jeremy’s Razors and why a company like this was necessary.“The most amazing thing about [this is] … this is my first time on the show, and my first time to share this information publicly — we’ve sold 25,000 razor subscriptions in our first three days as a company, which is an amazing thing, obviously, and it makes the joke much funnier,” Boreing said.“With this, I was so incensed, not by Harry’s razors pulling their ads, which that’s just the market at work — if an advertiser wants to pull their ads out of our shows because they’re going through an economic hard time … the ads aren’t working, they just don’t like the cut of our jib, all of that is fair game,” he continued.“If they attack us on their way out publicly — well, that’s just bad behavior. That’s rude behavior,” Boreing explained.“We were good partners. We told our audience, leveraged our personal credibility to tell our audience about Harry’s razors, our conservative audience, by the way. Harry’s knew what they were getting, they knew what they were buying,” he continued. “And on their way out, they decided to virtue signal and respond to a tweet that had two followers, and say that we had ‘inexcusable views’ and a case of ‘values misalignment,’ and I thought, well, I still have the same audience I had yesterday, why don’t I tell that audience that Harry’s doesn’t want their business?”As a press release from the company said on the day of its launch, “Jeremy’s Razors is more than a men’s grooming line. Jeremy’s Razors is a message to woke corporations that hate half the country, but love to take their money: your customers have the power to choose, and they’re not afraid to do so.”Jeremy’s Razors added in a press release this week that the company “will begin accepting pre-orders for shaving kits today that customers can expect to be delivered by Father’s Day.” Pre-orders can be placed at ihateharrys.com.According to the press release, the shaving kits include: A strong razor handle (not like the Beta stuff other brands use) Jeremy’s Green Tea & Menthol Shave Cream and Post Shave Balm, hand-selected by “the god-king” Eight razor cartridges A razor subscription to keep that mug looking fresh, foreverThe episode can be watched here:Related:Jeremy’s Razors Surprises Harry’s With Advertisements Directly Across From Company HeadquartersThe Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies for breaking news, investigative reporting, sports, podcasts, in-depth analysis, books, and entertainment for a reason: because we believe in what we do.

The Daily Wire,Pro-Life Sidewalk Counselor Testifies At Jackson Hearing,C,"Pro-Life Sidewalk Counselor Testifies At Jackson Hearing | The Daily WireThe Daily WireMenuCloseReadListenWatchDiscussShopSearchLoginJoin— News and Commentary —Pro-Life Sidewalk Counselor Testifies At Jackson HearingBy  Charlotte Pence Bond•Mar 24, 2022   DailyWire.com•FacebookTwitterMailTom Williams/Contributor/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images
On Thursday, a pro-life counselor testified at the Supreme Court confirmation hearing for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, detailing her role as a sidewalk counselor, sharing profound and moving stories about her work helping pregnant women.Eleanor McCullen spoke to the committee, and described her efforts to tell women the options they have other than abortion.She explained, “I have dedicated my life in service to empowering women as a sidewalk counselor. I was also the lead plaintiff in an important free speech case, McCullen Vs. Coakley.”“So many women I’ve met believe that their only choice is to end the life of their baby. It is in that moment of isolation and fear that I have the privilege of offering a different choice, one that empowers and encourages the woman to know she is fully capable of becoming a mom and pursuing a job, and going to school, and having a successful and happy life,” she said.“It’s a powerful moment when a woman looks at me and our eyes connect and she stops to talk. It’s in that moment I promise her she will never walk her journey alone,” she added.She said that she tells them, “I will stand with you throughout the nine months and beyond. I will hold your hand.”“I’m able to provide the mothers whatever resources they might need in that moment, including medical care, financial support, of course they come to our house, of course baby clothes and bassinets. I’ve had many, many, many, many baby showers,” she added, noting that they have been able to financially help mothers go back to school.“And I just stick with the mothers and their families for as long as they need my help … and being able to watch the children grow up, children who wouldn’t be here had the mother not stopped to talk to me. This is an incredible privilege,” she said.She explained how she knows the pain of being unable to serve women when the government attempts to step in and prohibit free speech.She discussed a 2007 Massachusetts law that created a “buffer zone” around abortion facilities prohibiting pro-life speakers from coming within a certain distance of the facility. McCullen challenged the legislation in a lawsuit. She said the entire reason she challenged the law was because she didn’t want to shout from a distance or appear as if she didn’t have compassion.She described how Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote an amicus brief as an attorney in support of Massachusetts’ previous buffer zone law enacted in 2000.In 2014, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the Massachusetts law violated the First Amendment.McCullen went on to tell a story about a woman who recently called her after finding her card in a baby scrapbook for her daughter, who is now eighteen years old and heading to college. The woman thanked McCullen for being there to talk to her, saying that her daughter is “the joy of our life.”McCullen pressed Judge Jackson to uphold all Americans’ First Amendment freedoms if confirmed.WATCH:As The Daily Wire reported, while she was a lawyer, Jackson wrote an amicus brief in defense of a Massachusetts law that controlled actions within a certain distance of “reproductive health care” centers.According to the brief:The Massachusetts Act, however, regulates conduct only within eighteen feet of a “reproductive health care facility.”Within that narrow zone, the Act makes it unlawful to “knowingly approach” within six feet of another person, without that person’s consent, “for the purpose of passing a leaflet or handbill to, displaying a sign to, or engaging in oral protest, education or counseling with such other person…”The amicus brief also stated:Contrary to the district court’s implication, the Act grew out of a sustained legislative effort to balance the free speech rights of abortion protesters against patients’ and providers’ right of access. The Legislature’s solution, developed by a working committee comprised of legislators with differing views on the issue, was a compromise: a statute that permits speakers on all sides of the abortion debate to voice their views about reproductive health services openly and vigorously, so long as, within an eighteen-foot radius of clinic entrances and driveways, such speakers do not approach within six feet of unconsenting individuals. This “floating bubble” legislation has the advantage of protecting the interests of everyone involved in the abortion debate: it allows free and open communication while at the same time enabling patients and staff members to proceed into the clinic unhindered.The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest growing conservative media companies for breaking news, investigative reporting, sports, podcasts, in-depth analysis, books, and entertainment for a reason: because we believe in what we do.

The Daily Wire,NCAA Ignores Outcry From Female Swimmers Over Biological Men In Women’s Sports,C,"NCAA Ignores Outcry From Female Swimmers Over Biological Men In Women’s Sports | The Daily WireThe Daily WireMenuCloseReadListenWatchDiscussShopSearchLoginJoin— Exclusive —NCAA Ignores Outcry From Female Swimmers Over Biological Men In Women’s SportsBy  Mary Margaret Olohan•Mar 24, 2022   DailyWire.com•FacebookTwitterMail(Photo by Rich von Biberstein/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)
The NCAA is apparently ignoring national outcry over the inclusion of a biologically male athlete in the recent NCAA Women’s Swimming Championships, staying silent despite concerns from swimmers, parents, and the public at large.The Daily Wire has repeatedly reached out to the association regarding testimony from fathers and swimmers who protest against Lia Thomas, a biologically male athlete, swimming in female races.Despite highly publicized calls for action from Virginia Tech swimmer Reka Gyorgy and University of Kentucky swimmer Riley Gaines — both of whom competed against Thomas and suffered for it, the NCAA has not responded to requests for comment.Gyorgy placed 17th in the 500 freestyle, meaning that she did not make it back to the finals and was a first alternate. If Thomas, a biological male, had not participated, Gyorgy would have made it to the finals.“I’m writing this letter right now in hopes that the NCAA will open their eyes and change these rules in the future,” she wrote in a letter to the NCAA that she released Sunday. “It doesn’t promote our sport in a good way and I think it is disrespectful against the biologically female swimmers who are competing in the NCAA.”Gaines competed in the women’s 200 freestyle and tied for fifth place with Thomas. In an interview with The Daily Wire, she said she was made to hold the sixth-place trophy during award ceremony pictures, while Thomas was given the fifth-place trophy.The swimmer believes that the NCAA was “trying to save face” in elevating Thomas in this situation, telling The Daily Wire that the experience was “disheartening” and that she “left the pool with no trophy.”“Who are we trying to protect here?” she questioned, “and who are we trying to fight for here?”The NCAA Board of Governors updated its transgender participation policy in January, requiring transgender athletes to document “sport-specific” testosterone levels within their sport’s approved range at the beginning of the season and ahead of championship selections.“We are steadfast in our support of transgender student-athletes and the fostering of fairness across college sports,” John DeGioia, chair of the NCAA board and president of Georgetown University, said in a statement at the time.“It is important that NCAA member schools, conferences and college athletes compete in an inclusive, fair, safe and respectful environment and can move forward with a clear understanding of the new policy,” he added.But parents and athletes apparently do not find the move bold enough.Linnea Saltz, a former NCAA track athlete who raced against a biological man, is not surprised that the NCAA has preserved silence on the matter since she brought her concerns to the association in 2019 with little results.“Here we are today still dealing with the same issues,” she said.Saltz told The Daily Wire on Thursday that she hoped that seeing the “overwhelming amount of individuals” affected by the NCAA’s decision would prompt the association to “finally make a decision that protects these women.”In the spring of 2020 I raced a biological male in NCAA DI track and field. I laid out for the @NCAA exactly how unfair this was.

It is clear a decision needs to be made as the situation will continue to worsen and more individuals will become affected if not.”The NCAA’s silence on the matter perhaps indicates that the organization hopes outcry will die down and concerns over the issue will be forgotten.But parents told The Daily Wire at the championships in Atlanta that the entire meet was abuzz with concerns and qualms about fairness in women’s sports.“If the NCAA continues to sideline women and the accomplishments of female athletes, Congress must hold them accountable,” Annabelle Rutledge, national director for Young Women for America, told The Daily Wire. “And as American citizens, we must be relentless in our support of female athletes, calling on the Administration to uphold Title IX, and engaging with our state and federal members to hold the NCAA to account.”The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest growing conservative media companies for breaking news, investigative reporting, sports, podcasts, in-depth analysis, books, and entertainment for a reason: because we believe in what we do.

The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday sided with Wisconsin Republicans challenging “redistricting” efforts from Democrats in the state, throwing out legislative maps drawn by Democratic Governor Tony Evers and adopted by its highest court, The Washington Post reported.The Supreme Court granted a Republican request to block new maps that “increased the number of state Assembly districts with a majority of Black voters from six to seven,” Reuters reported. “The court sent that case back to the Wisconsin Supreme Court and ordered it to adopt new maps laying out the various districts.”The Wisconsin Supreme Court “committed legal error in its application of decisions of this Court regarding the relationship between the constitutional guarantee of equal protection and the VRA (Voting Right Act),” the opinion said, adding that the state court “believed that it had to conclude only that the VRA might support race-based districting — not that the statute required it. … Our precedent instructs otherwise.”“The question that our VRA precedents ask and the court failed to answer is whether a race-neutral alternative that did not add a seventh majority-black district would deny black voters equal political opportunity,” the majority wrote.The Wisconsin court “is free to take additional evidence if it prefers to reconsider the Governor’s maps rather than choose from among the other submissions. Any new analysis, however, must comply with our equal protection jurisprudence,” it added.Vox reported that the high court used a process known as “summary reversal” to toss the maps, “meaning that the Court tossed out the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s decision completely without receiving full briefing or hearing oral arguments.”Liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan dissented from the majority.“In an emergency posture, the Court summarily overturns a Wisconsin Supreme Court decision resolving a conflict over the State’s redistricting, a decision rendered after a 5-month process involving all interested stakeholders,” Sotomayor wrote, according to The Hill. “Despite the fact that summary reversals are generally reserved for decisions in violation of settled law, the Court today faults the State Supreme Court for its failure to comply with an obligation that, under existing precedent, is hazy at best.”In a second unsigned ruling, “the court rejected a challenge from five Republican congressmen who objected to the congressional map adopted by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which had also been prepared by Mr. Evers, a Democrat,” The New York Times reported.Democrats and their allies in the media fumed over the news, claiming it was an attack on “voting rights.”“Today’s Supreme Court action in Wisconsin is simply wrong and is grounded in an unprecedented process and a failure to adhere to precedent,” former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder posted to social media. “The Court continues to put its legitimacy at risk.”Today’s Supreme Court action in Wisconsin is simply wrong and is grounded in an unprecedented process and a failure to adhere to precedent.

U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) announced on Thursday that he will not support President Joe Biden’s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, after coming into the process with “an open mind.”“After studying the nominee’s record and watching her performance this week, I cannot and will not support Judge Jackson for a lifetime appointment to our highest Court,” McConnell said in a statement. “First, Judge Jackson refuses to reject the fringe position that Democrats should try to pack the Supreme Court. Justices Ginsburg and Breyer had no problem denouncing this unpopular view and defending their institution. I assumed this would be an easy softball for Judge Jackson. But it wasn’t.”“The nominee suggested there are two legitimate sides to the issue,” he continued. “She testified that she has a view on the matter but would not share it. She inaccurately compared her non-answer to a different, narrower question that a prior nominee was asked. But Judge Jackson seemingly tipped her hand. She said she would be, ‘thrilled to be one of however many.’ The opposite of the Ginsburg and Breyer sentiment. The most radical pro-court-packing fringe groups badly wanted this nominee for this vacancy. Judge Jackson was the court-packers’ pick. And she testified like it.”McConnell specifically took issue with Jackson’s stances on crime and illegal immigration in his statement.“This is one area where Judge Jackson’s trial court records provide a wealth of information. And it is troubling,” McConnell said. “The Judge regularly gave certain terrible kinds of criminals light sentences that were beneath the sentencing guidelines and beneath the prosecutors’ requests. The Judge herself, this week, used the phrase ‘policy disagreement’ to describe this subject. The issue isn’t just the sentences. It’s also the Judge’s rhetoric in trial transcript and the creative ways she bent the law. In one instance, Judge Jackson used COVID as a pretext to essentially rewrite a criminal justice reform law from the bench and make it retroactive, which Congress had declined to do.”“She did so to cut the sentence of a fentanyl trafficker while Americans died in huge numbers from overdoses,” he continued. “Judge Jackson declined to walk Senators through the merits of her reasoning in specific cases. She just kept repeating that it was her discretion, and if Congress didn’t like it, it was our fault for giving her the discretion. That is hardly an explanation as to why she uses her discretion the way she does. It was not reassuring to hear Judge Jackson essentially say that if Senators want her to be tough on crime, we need to change the law, take away her discretion, and force her to do it. That response just seems to confirm that deeply-held personal policy views seep into her jurisprudence. And that is exactly what the record suggests.”The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest growing conservative media companies for breaking news, investigative reporting, sports, podcasts, in-depth analysis, books, and entertainment for a reason: because we believe in what we do.

A feminist organization is condemning the NCAA for staying silent amid a national controversy over the inclusion of a biologically male athlete in the recent NCAA Women’s Swimming Championships.“We are deeply disappointed by the NCAA’s promotion and celebration of a male athlete over the wellbeing of female athletes during the past few months,” Mahri Irvine, the executive director of the Women’s Liberation Front (WoLF), said in a Thursday afternoon statement to The Daily Wire.WoLF weighed in following a Daily Wire report exposing the NCAA’s silence as fathers, swimmers, and members of the public protest the inclusion of Lia Thomas, a biologically male athlete, in female races.The NCAA has not responded to many requests for comment from The Daily Wire, despite highly publicized calls for action from Virginia Tech swimmer Reka Gyorgy and University of Kentucky swimmer Riley Gaines — both of whom competed against Thomas and suffered for it.“Lia Thomas has been portrayed by the NCAA as a woman who legitimately deserves to compete in women’s sports,” Irvine said. “However, nothing could be further from the truth.”The WoLF executive director pointed to the fact that Thomas, who won the 500 freestyle last Thursday evening, tied for fifth in the 200 freestyle Friday evening, and placed eighth in the 100 freestyle, formerly raced with men for three years.“Lia is a man who didn’t do particularly well in men’s swimming competitions,” Irvine said. “This man decided to say that he is a woman in order to gain access to women’s sports.”WoLF is disappointed not just by the NCAA’s “silent treatment toward female athletes,” Irvine said. The organization is also “gravely concerned that the NCAA has chosen to engage in gaslighting of our entire country.”“We all know that Lia Thomas is male, and we all know that the NCAA is engaging in psychological manipulation of athletes, coaches, sports fans, and the general public,” the WoLF executive director continued.ATLANTA, GA – MARCH 18: University of Pennsylvania swimmer Lia Thomas and Kentucky swimmer Riley Gaines react after finishing tied for 5th in the 200 Freestyle finals at the NCAA Swimming and Diving Championships. (Photo by Rich von Biberstein/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)“We hope that the NCAA will somehow find the courage to admit that it has made serious errors in judgment related to this issue,” she added. “We hope that someday, the NCAA will actually start supporting female athletes instead of devaluing them and psychologically manipulating them.”The Daily Wire also reached out to a slew of women’s advocacy groups for this story, including the Women’s March, Ultra Violet, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Emily’s List, the National Women’s Law Center, and the Center for Reproductive Rights.Ultra Violet declined to weigh in on the matter, while the rest of the organizations remained silent.Gyorgy placed 17th in the 500 freestyle, meaning that she did not make it back to the finals, and was a first alternate. Had Thomas, a biological male, not participated, Gyorgy would have made it to the finals.“I’m writing this letter right now in hopes that the NCAA will open their eyes and change these rules in the future,” she wrote in a letter to the NCAA that she released Sunday. “It doesn’t promote our sport in a good way and I think it is disrespectful against the biologically female swimmers who are competing in the NCAA.”Gaines competed in the women’s 200 freestyle and tied for fifth place with Thomas. In an interview with The Daily Wire, she revealed that she was made to hold the sixth place trophy during award ceremony pictures, while Thomas was given the fifth place trophy.The swimmer believes that the NCAA was “trying to save face” in elevating Thomas in this situation, telling The Daily Wire that the experience was “disheartening” and that she “left the pool with no trophy.”“Who are we trying to protect here,” she questioned, “and who are we trying to fight for here?”The NCAA Board of Governors updated its transgender participation policy in January, requiring transgender athletes to document “sport-specific” testosterone levels within their sport’s approved range at the beginning of the season and ahead of championship selections.The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest growing conservative media companies for breaking news, investigative reporting, sports, podcasts, in-depth analysis, books, and entertainment for a reason: because we believe in what we do.

Former President Donald Trump sued numerous people and entities involved with the Steele Dossier and the 2016 Russian collusion conspiracy on Thursday.Trump’s suit, filed in the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Florida, accuses former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former FBI Director James Comey, the Democratic National Committee, and dozens of others of engaging in an organized plot to spread malicious and false information about Trump.“In the run-up to the 2016 Presidential Election, Hillary Clinton and her cohorts orchestrated an unthinkable plot — one that shocks the conscience and is an affront to this nation’s democracy,” Trump’s suit begins. “Acting in concert, the Defendants maliciously conspired to weave a false narrative that their Republican opponent, Donald J. Trump, was colluding with a hostile foreign sovereignty. The actions taken in furtherance of their scheme — falsifying evidence, deceiving law enforcement, and exploiting access to highly-sensitive data sources — are so outrageous, subversive and incendiary that even the events of Watergate pale in comparison.”“Under the guise of ‘opposition research,’ ‘data analytics,’ and other political stratagems, the Defendants nefariously sought to sway the public’s trust. They worked together with a single, self-serving purpose: to vilify Donald J. Trump,” the suit continues. “Indeed, their far-reaching conspiracy was designed to cripple Trump’s bid for presidency by fabricating a scandal that would be used to trigger an unfounded federal investigation and ignite a media frenzy.”Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and his subsequent presidency was hounded by allegations that his campaign worked with Moscow to rig the 2016 presidential election. The allegations stemmed from the Steele Dossier, a report put together by former British spy Christopher Steele and funded by Clinton’s campaign.Former special counsel Robert Mueller found no evidence of the alleged collusion after a roughly two-year investigation into the dossier and Russia’s role in the 2016 election.Trump’s lawsuit alleges that the defendants violated U.S. RICO laws, or laws used against organized crime groups such as gangs and mafias, among other violations.“The members of the Enterprise are a group of persons associated together for the common purpose of carrying on an ongoing enterprise; specifically, the Enterprise had a common, unlawful goal of dismantling the Plaintiff’s political career and/or impeding his ability to effectively govern through fraudulent, deceptive, and criminal means, including, but not limited to, falsely implicating the Plaintiff, the Trump Campaign, and the Trump Administration as colluding with Russia,” the lawsuit states, explaining its RICO case.Combatting the false allegations cost Trump at least $24 million, according to the lawsuit.“Among other things, the Plaintiff was forced to incur expenses in an amount to be determined at trial, but known to be in excess of twenty-four million dollars ($24,000,000) and continuing to accrue, in the form of defense costs, legal fees, and related expenses incurred in connection with his effort to defend against the Defendants’ actions and the various federal investigations and/or official proceedings which arose therefrom, in addition to the loss of existing and future business opportunities for himself, the Trump Campaign, and the Trump Organization LLC,” the lawsuit says.The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest growing conservative media companies for breaking news, investigative reporting, sports, podcasts, in-depth analysis, books, and entertainment for a reason: because we believe in what we do.

Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) brought himself — and Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson — to tears on Wednesday as he broke into an animated explanation of just how much her nomination meant to him.Booker used a portion of his time during Jackson’s confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee to wax on about the historic nature of her nomination, excitedly telling her, “I’m not letting anybody in the Senate steal my joy!”""This country is getting better and better…When that final vote happens and you ascend onto the highest Court in the land, I'm going to rejoice. And I'm going to tell you right now, the greatest country in the world, the United States of America, will be better because of you."" pic.twitter.com/HLT3WnH3LU— CSPAN (@cspan) March 24, 2022“I’m telling you right now,” Booker began, “I’m not letting anybody in the Senate steal my joy! I told you this at the beginning, I — I’m embarrassed … I just look at you, and I start getting full of emotion.”The New Jersey Senator went on to tell a story about going for a run, saying that a black woman had approached him — in part, he believed, because of the role he would have in confirming Judge Jackson.“I put my music on loud when I’m jogging, trying to block out the noise of the heart attack I’m having,” Booker said, prompting laughs. “And this woman comes up on me, practically tackles me, an African American woman. And the look on her eye, she just wanted to touch me, ’cause I think — ’cause I’m sitting so close to you — and tell me what it meant to her to watch you sitting where you’re sitting.”Booker then touted Judge Jackson’s hard work and dedication, saying that she hadn’t achieved all she had because of a “Left-wing agenda” — and Jackson reached for her tissues.“You got here how every black woman in America who’s gotten anywhere has done,” Booker continued, his voice cracking at times. “By being — like Ginger Rogers said, ‘I did everything Fred Astaire did, but backwards in heels.’ And so I’m just sitting here saying, ‘Nobody’s stealing my joy, nobody’s going to make me angry.'”Booker then mentioned how he was treated when he arrived at the Capitol, being only the fourth black Senator in Washington. His voice wavered again when he explained the moment in the Oval Office when he tried to explain to President Joe Biden how much it affected him personally to see the first black woman nominated to the nation’s highest court.“It’s hard for me not to look at you and not see my mom. Not to see my cousins, one of them who had to come here and sit behind you. She had to have your back. I see my ancestors and yours,” Booker said. “But don’t worry, my sister. Don’t worry. God has got you. And how do I know that? You’re here, and I know what it’s taken for you to sit in that seat.”“You have earned this spot. You are worthy. You are a great American,” he added, in an apparent jab and critics who panned Biden for making Jackson’s race and gender requirements for her nomination.“This country is getting better and better,” Booker concluded. “When that final vote happens and you ascend onto the highest Court in the land, I’m going to rejoice. And I’m going to tell you right now, the greatest country in the world, the United States of America, will be better because of you.”The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest growing conservative media companies for breaking news, investigative reporting, sports, podcasts, in-depth analysis, books, and entertainment for a reason: because we believe in what we do.

California State University (CSU) will no longer require students to submit SAT or ACT scores for college admissions, making it the largest four-year college system in the country to drop the requirement.CBS News reported that CSU’s Board of Trustees voted unanimously on Wednesday to make the change, and that the move follows the University of California’s decision to do the same in 2020. CSU had already suspended the use of test scores during the 2021-22 and 2022-23 academic years due to the coronavirus pandemic, but this week made the move permanent.“This decision aligns with the California State University’s continued efforts to level the playing field and provide greater access to a high-quality college degree for students from all backgrounds,” CSU acting Chancellor Steve Relyea said in a statement, according to CBS. “In essence, we are eliminating our reliance on the high-stress, high-stakes test that has shown negligible benefit and providing our applicants with greater opportunities to demonstrate their drive, talents and potential for college success.”Students can still use the test scores to get placed into the right math and English courses, but they will no longer need them specifically for admission into the university system. Instead, CSU said it would “utilize a multi-factored admission criteria to determine student eligibility in lieu of standardized test scores.”The Daily Wire previously reported in June 2020 that the UC system voted to stop requiring SAT and ACT scores because, as some members claimed, the test was harmful to minorities. The Daily Wire reported:Yet only a few weeks earlier, the entire faculty senate voted to retain the SAT as a result of a study commissioned by UC system president Janet Napolitano that found that the SAT and the ACT increased minority enrollment across the UC system.“The 228-page report, loaded with hundreds of displays of data from the UC’s various admissions departments, found that the SAT and a commonly used alternative test, ACT —  also eliminated – actually helped increase black, Hispanic, and Native American enrollment at the system’s 10 campuses. The report recommended that their use be continued,” Richard Bernstein of RealClearInvestigations reported.The report stated, “The Task Force found that of the 22,613 students guaranteed admission through the statewide index (the admissions pathway in which test scores can compensate for lower HSGPA) but not through Eligibility in the Local Context (ELC), which only considers high school grades, about 25% were members of underrepresented minority groups, and 47% were low-income or first generation students. These students would not have been guaranteed admission on the basis of their grades alone.”Yet the testing requirement was still removed.Earlier this year, The Daily Wire reported that the SAT was going to be shortened and taken entirely online.“Beginning in 2024 for U.S. students, the test will be shortened to two hours instead of the current grueling three hours, and it will allow more time per question. The new SAT will also feature shorter reading passages with one question per passage, and students will be allowed to use a calculator for the math section,” The Daily Wire reported. “The new SAT will also be online, although it will still be administered in-person at schools and test centers. However, students will be able to choose whether they want to use their personal tablet or laptop or a school device. In addition, the new test will speed up the turnaround time for students to get their scores from weeks to days.”The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest growing conservative media companies for breaking news, investigative reporting, sports, podcasts, in-depth analysis, books, and entertainment for a reason: because we believe in what we do.

Photograph: José Torres/ReutersReutersThu 24 Mar 2022 17.10 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Mar 2022 20.57 EDTWaves of migration through Mexico and Central America, and people who go missing, will increase in 2022 due to high levels of violence in the region, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said.Battle-scarred ghost town bears mute witness to Mexico’s drug warsRead more“In many countries, violence is wreaking more and more havoc, and that’s why there are more and more migrants,” ICRC representative Jordi Raich told Reuters in an interview Wednesday. “And it’s not a situation that is going to improve or slow down, not even in the years to come.“Immigration authorities in Mexico detained 307,679 migrants in 2021, a 68% increase compared with 182,940 detentions in 2019, according to government data.Shelters in Mexico were completely overwhelmed last year, filled with frustrated migrants unable to continue their journey to the United States, Raich said.Many migrants get “stuck” along Mexico’s southern or northern borders, Raich said, where they face “enormous economic constraints” and are able to find only basic services.The administration of Joe Biden has faced record numbers of migrants arriving at the southern border and has implored Mexico and Central American countries to do more to stem the wave.Disappearances in the region have not slowed either, the Red Cross said in a report released Thursday. Mexico recently surpassed 100,000 people reported missing in the country.In El Salvador, 488 missing person cases remain unsolved, and in Guatemala, the number of missing women rose to six a day, the Red Cross report said.Raich said it will be difficult to respond to the root causes of migration immediately. A joint effort among countries like El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras is necessary, he added.“Migration is not going to stop,” Raich said. “If you try to prevent it or strictly regulate it, people start to pile up at the borders, which is happening in Mexico and other countries.”Meanwhile, the Biden administration on Thursday rolled out a sweeping new regulation that aims to speed up asylum processing and deportations at the US-Mexico border, amid a record number of migrants seeking to enter the US.The announcement of the new rule came as US officials are debating whether to end a separate Covid-era policy that has blocked most asylum claims at the border. The asylum overhaul could provide a faster way to process border crossers if the Covid order is ended.‘Traumatised and terrified, with nowhere else to go’: huge numbers of people stuck at US borderRead moreThe final asylum rule, which will go into effect in late May, will authorize asylum officers to accept or reject migrants’ claims for protection soon after they cross the border, in an effort to resolve them in months rather than years by bypassing backlogged US immigration courts.US immigration courts struggle amid understaffing and backlog of casesRead moreThe administration of Democratic president Joe Biden says it is a humane way to deal with the rising number of attempted border crossings, which have hit records and triggered attacks from Republicans aiming to take control of Congress in the November midterm elections.The new policy faced criticism from groups that favor more immigration restrictions as well as from some pro-immigrant advocacy organizations, and may be challenged in court.Most migrants apprehended at the US south-west border come from Mexico and Central America, but an increasing number are arriving from farther places and seeking refuge, including in recent weeks Ukrainians fleeing Russia’s invasion of their country.Under the new rule, which is being issued jointly by the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice, more migrants, including families, will be placed in a process known as “expedited removal” to resolve cases more quickly. It will not apply to unaccompanied children.“The current system for handling asylum claims at our borders has long needed repair,” homeland security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement.Some immigrant rights advocates oppose the fast-track process, which aims to process cases within 90 days, fearing it will lead to more deportations.The new rule “risks sacrificing accurate decision-making for its narrative of speed”, said Eleanor Acer, senior director for refugee protection at Human Rights First.While migrants denied asylum will get another chance to make their case before an immigration judge, those cases will also be expedited with a goal of resolving them within 90 days.Biden has kept a controversial order known as Title 42, allowing authorities to quickly expel most migrants caught crossing the border to Mexico or other countries to limit the spread of Covid-19.The administration is leaning toward ending the order after court decisions that complicate its implementation, and is faced with a deadline next week to renew, modify or terminate it.TopicsMigrationMexicoAmericasBiden administrationUS politicsnewsReuse this contentMost popularMost popularWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usContact usComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2022 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty ImagesReuters in WashingtonThu 24 Mar 2022 18.08 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Mar 2022 18.25 EDTThe US has unveiled criminal charges against four Russian government officials, saying they engaged in two major hacking campaigns between 2012 and 2018 that targeted the global energy sector and affected thousands of computers across 135 countries.In one now-unsealed indictment from August 2021, the justice department said three alleged hackers from Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) carried out cyber-attacks on the computer networks of oil and gas firms, nuclear power plants, and utility and power transmission companies across the world between 2012 and 2017.The three accused Russians in that case are Pavel Aleksandrovich Akulov, 36, Mikhail Mikhailovich Gavrilov, 42, and Marat Valeryevich Tyukov, 39.Triton: hackers take out safety systems in ‘watershed’ attack on energy plantRead moreIn a second unsealed indictment from June 2021, the DoJ accused Evgeny Viktorovich Gladkikh, a 36-year-old Russian ministry of defense research institute employee, of conspiring with others between May and September 2017 to hack the systems of a foreign refinery and install malware known as “Triton” on a safety system produced by Schneider Electric.The justice department unsealed the two cases just days after US president Joe Biden warned about “evolving intelligence” suggesting the Russian government is exploring options for more cyber-attacks in the future.A department official told reporters on Thursday that even though the hacking at issue in the two cases occurred years ago, investigators remained concerned Russia will continue to launch similar attacks.These charges show the dark art of the possible when it comes to critical infrastructure,” the official said.The official added that the four accused Russians are not in custody, but the department decided to unseal the indictments because they determined the “benefit of revealing the results of the investigation now outweighs the likelihood of arrests in the future.”The 2017 attack stunned the cybersecurity community when it was made public by researchers later that year because – unlike typical digital intrusions aimed at stealing data or holding it for ransom – it appeared aimed at causing physical damage to the facility itself by disabling its safety system.US officials have been tracking the case and its aftershocks ever since.In 2019, those behind Triton were reported to be scanning and probing at least 20 electric utilities in the United States for vulnerabilities.The following year – two weeks before the 2020 US presidential election – the US treasury department sanctioned the Russian government-backed Central Scientific Research Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics, where Gladkikh is alleged to have worked.The news of the indictment represents “a shot across the bow” to any Russian hacking groups that might be poised to carry out destructive attacks against US critical infrastructure, said John Hultquist of the cybersecurity firm Mandiant.Now that these criminal charges are public, he added, the United States has “let them know that we know who they are.”.TopicsRussiaHackingEuropenewsReuse this contentMost popularMost popularWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usContact usComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2022 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Andrew Kelly/ReutersGloria Oladipo@gaoladipoThu 24 Mar 2022 11.16 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Mar 2022 11.18 EDTThe attorney general of Texas has declared a school district’s celebration of LGBTQ+ students “sex education” and in violation of Texas law.For the past eight years, students in the Austin Independent school district have held a district-wide Pride week as a chance to celebrate LGBTQ+ students, staff and families in the district, according to the district’s website.But on Tuesday, the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, sent a letter to the school district calling Pride week “sex education” and notifying the school that without parental consent, the celebration is “breaking state law”.“The Texas legislature has made it clear that when it comes to sex education, parents – not school districts – are in charge,” said Paxton in his letter shared to Twitter.“By hosting ‘Pride week’, your district has, at best, undertaken a week-long instructional effort in human sexuality without parental consent,” continued Paxton. “Or, worse, your district is cynically pushing a week-long indoctrination of your students that not only fails to obtain parental consent, but subtly cuts parents out of the loop. Either way, you are breaking state law.”The school district’s superintendent, Dr Stephanie S Elizalde, responded to the attorney general’s comments about 45 minutes after Paxton posted his letter.“I want all our LGBTQIA+ students to know that we are proud of them and that we will protect them against political attacks,” said Elizalde on Twitter.District spokesperson Jason Stanford spoke with the Washington Post and shared a similar message: “We’re going to react to this by doubling down on making sure our kids feel safe and celebrating Pride.”Stanford also noted that Paxton’s letter was politically motivated as Paxton faces a primary runoff with another Republican in May and is being investigated by the FBI for bribery and abuse of office.“This is not a parental rights issue,” said Stanford to the Post. “This is a Ken Paxton trying to score political points issue.”In recent weeks, Paxton has targeted LGBTQ+ youth in Texas. In addition to the letter, last month, Paxton wrote an opinion stating that gender-affirming care for children was “child abuse” under Texas law, prompting the Republican governor, Greg Abbott, to instruct the state’s child protection services to investigate parents providing their children with that care.When a judge temporarily blocked Abbott’s order, Paxton asked the state supreme court to overturn the ban.After the Pride week’s agenda was shared online, some administrators in the Austin Independent school district had their personal information posted online and have received death threats, reported KUT, a local news affiliate.Students were forced to have pride celebrations inside as police were stationed outside.“The kids had no idea what was going on, but the teachers were afraid to go to work,” said Stanford. “So the last thing we’re worried about is what Ken Paxton has to say.”TopicsTexasUS educationLGBT rightsnewsReuse this contentMost popularMost popularUSWorldEnvironmentSoccerUS PoliticsBusinessTechScienceNewslettersFight to voteNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usContact usComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2022 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: The Asahi Shimbun/Getty ImagesMaya YangThu 24 Mar 2022 16.46 EDTFirst published on Thu 24 Mar 2022 15.50 EDTAn 83-year old man is set to sail from San Francisco on Saturday and voyage alone across the Pacific Ocean to his home country, Japan.Kenichi Horie, also known as “Japan’s most famous yachtsman”, became the first person to make a non-stop solo crossing of the Pacific in 1962. On that trip,  he was still a 23-year old amateur seaman. Horie set off from Osaka and sailed across the ocean for 94 days, surviving on canned food and rice before arriving in San Francisco.Kenichi Horie and his wife Eriko in Resolute, Canada, on 21 August 1979. Photograph: The Asahi Shimbun/Getty ImagesThe voyage has been widely regarded as a “one-man olive branch of post-war diplomacy” between Pacific powers, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.“Even in the states, yachtsmen are inspired by his story,” said Morgan Smith, manager of Interpretation, Education and Volunteers at San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park.Upon arriving in San Francisco, Horie was briefly arrested as he had traveled without a passport or money and little knowledge of English. However, then Mayor George Christopher soon released him and gave him a visa in honor of his bravery.In the 60 years since then, Horie has made multiple Pacific crossings. The boat Horie used in 1962 has been on display at San Francisco’s Maritime Museum. Named “Mermaid,” the boat lives in the museum’s foyer and is the “superstar” attraction, John Muir, the museum’s small craft curator, told the San Francisco Chronicle.Kenichi Horie leaves the bay of Salinas in Ecuador on board his cigar-shaped vessel, Malt’s Mermaid, on 21 March 1996. Photograph: Claudia Daut/ReutersHorie has voyaged across the Pacific on a variety of vessels, including ones made from aluminum cans and powered by solar panels and another propelled by foot pedals. In 1999, he sailed from the west coast to Japan on a catamaran made out of beer kegs. Three years later, he sailed the other way around via whiskey barrels.For his upcoming journey on Saturday, Horie’s vessel is a 2,182lb and 19ft long sailboat made out of pale aluminum, customized to fit his build.At 5ft tall, Horie does not physically train for his voyages, telling the publication, “I’m always fine, always in shape … No overeating, no over-drinking”.When asked whether he had any concerns for his trip, Horie said, “Nothing at all. Maybe just being old.”TopicsSan FranciscoJapanAsia PacificnewsReuse this contentMost popularMost popularUSWorldEnvironmentSoccerUS PoliticsBusinessTechScienceNewslettersFight to voteNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usContact usComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2022 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Jeff Chiu/APCalifornia’s gas prices are consistently the highest in the nation.  Photograph: Jeff Chiu/APDani Anguiano in Los Angeles and agencies@dani_anguianoThu 24 Mar 2022 20.21 EDTLast modified on Mon 28 Mar 2022 14.38 EDTCalifornia residents could get free public transit rides and gas rebates under a proposal from the governor to help bring relief as fuel prices in the state reach record highs.Gavin Newsom’s plan is the latest floated by officials in California, where drivers are paying more for fuel than anywhere else in the country.US gas prices have started to slowly fall after reaching record levels in recent weeks, surging in part because of pandemic-induced inflation and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But prices in the Golden state have continued to trend upward, and California drivers are now paying an average of $5.88 a gallon, according to AAA.‘It’s not worth it’: rising gas prices force drivers to work for less than minimum wageRead moreHere’s what we know about the governor’s proposal:What is Newsom’s plan?The Democratic governor has proposed giving all drivers in the state $400 debit cards for up to two vehicles, amounting to a total of $800. Anyone who has a car registered in California would receive the money, regardless of income, immigration status or whether or not their vehicles use gasoline.Newsom wants to give $750m to transit and rail agencies to cover bus or train fare for Californians who do not own cars. That funding would would cover the costs for free rides for 3 million people a day for three months, the governor said.The plan also includes $1.1bn to pause scheduled inflationary increases for diesel and fuel taxes this summer, and $500m for projects that promote biking and walking.Why is Newsom doing this?California’s gas prices are consistently the highest in the nation. On Wednesday, the state’s average gas prices hit a new record at $5.88 a gallon, more than $2 higher than it was a year ago, according to AAA.The high fuel costs are hitting residents hard, particularly gig workers for whom fuel makes up a large part of their daily costs.Giving money directly to taxpayers would provide relief and allow Newsom to avoid suspending the state’s gas tax as other states have done. California’s gas tax is the second-highest in the US at 51 cents a gallon, but Democratic leaders have been wary of pausing it as they fear oil companies would not pass the savings along to drivers.What are the criticisms?Republican lawmakers in the state have urged Newsom to suspend California’s gas tax in order to provide immediate relief to drivers. Newsom’s proposal will take time to deliver – the governor’s office has said people could see rebates by July.“People need relief now,” said James Gallagher, the assembly Republican leader. “We’ve got now, like, four different competing plans amongst the Democrats. These guys are going to negotiate against themselves for weeks to months and who knows what we’re going to get.”Kevin Kiley, a Republican assemblyman, announced on 14 March that he will introduce a bill to suspend California’s gas tax. Photograph: Rich Pedroncelli/APMeanwhile, Democrats have concerns about providing assistance to all Californians with registered vehicles, regardless of their income. Democratic leaders have been discussing their own proposal, which would give $200 rebates to every taxpayer and their children with taxable income less than $125,000 for single filers and $250,000 for joint filers.Rising fuel prices pose a policy challenge for Newsom as he tries to wean the state off fossil fuels. He has signed executive orders aimed at banning the sale of new gas-powered cars in the state by 2035 and halting all oil extraction by 2045.Laura Deehan with Environment California, a nonprofit that advocates for an end to fossil fuel use, was critical of Newsom’s effort, and said that giving people money for gas would encourage them to drive more. Instead, the governor should use the $9bn on programs aimed at getting people out of gas-guzzling cars, she said.“Just giving out these rebates to anyone who has a car in the state isn’t going to help us in the long run move away from the volatility that comes with our dependence on fossil fuels,” she said.What happens next?The state legislature, where Democrats dominate both the assembly and the senate, must approve the plan. Newsom’s office said the governor would be willing to negotiate with lawmakers about who can get the money, a process that could take time to sort out.A moderate Democrat who supported a separately proposed plan to give every taxpayer $400 has indicated they would back Newsom’s effort and urged the legislature and governor to act quickly.“The contours of the governor’s proposal are a little different than what we proposed, but I would be very happy to support this,” said Cottie Petrie-Norris, a Democratic assembly member from Laguna Beach.What’s happening elsewhere in the US?With prices for fuel and other essentials soaring across the US, states are considering giving rebate checks directly to taxpayers as well as cutting sales taxes, offering property tax relief and reducing or suspending state gas taxes.The proposals come as many states have more funding than usual thanks to billions of dollars in federal pandemic aid and ballooning tax revenue.Janet Mills, Maine’s governor, wants to send $850 to most residents in the state to help with fuel costs and inflation. New Mexico’s governor recently signed off on a tax package that will give some taxpayers $250 checks, which lawmakers say will help with high gas prices.Maryland’s governor has signed a law temporarily suspending the state’s gas tax; Georgia has done the same while also offering $1.1bn in refunds to taxpayers. In Illinois, the governor has proposed halting a 2.2-cent increase in the motor fuel tax, suspending a 1% grocery sales tax for a year and providing a property tax rebate of up to $300.TopicsCaliforniaGasUS politicsexplainersReuse this contentMost popularMost popularUSWorldEnvironmentSoccerUS PoliticsBusinessTechScienceNewslettersFight to voteNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usContact usComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2022 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Toms Norde/AFP/Getty ImagesLeyland Cecco in TorontoThu 24 Mar 2022 10.50 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Mar 2022 01.32 EDTCanada has barred its soldiers from joining Ukraine’s “international brigade” of foreign fighters, amid growing concern that captured troops could be used as a Russian propaganda tool.Speaking to Canadian parliament’s defence committee on Wednesday, Lt Gen Frances Allen, the vice-chief of the defence staff, said top brass had issued an order preventing full-time service members and part-time reservists from travelling to join Ukraine’s newly formed foreign legion.The rule, which also applies to soldiers on leave, follows a call last month from the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, for volunteers to defend his country from Russia’s invasion.Thousands are believed to have answered, including enough Canadians to form their own battalion – the Canadian Ukrainian Brigade. While some veterans have used their skills for humanitarian work, others have picked up arms.‘My plan is there is no plan’: the foreign fighters flocking to UkraineRead moreThe only Canadian soldiers permitted to enter Ukraine are those with formal approval from Wayne Eyre, the chief of defence staff, said Allen. Canada had previously sent 250 military trainers to Ukraine, but those troops were moved to Poland before Russia invaded.Canadian officials have long been clear that they discourage travel to the region, but the foreign minister, Mélanie Joly, had previously said she was sympathetic to the Ukrainian Canadians wishing to defend the country. Canada has the largest Ukrainian diaspora outside Russia.“We understand that people of Ukrainian descent want to support their fellow Ukrainians and also that there is a desire to defend the motherland and in that sense it is their own individual decision,” Joly said in early March. “Let me be clear: we are all very supportive of any form of support to Ukrainians right now.”Much of that aid has been humanitarian, as well as shipments of weapons. Canada has also offered to accept an “unlimited” number of Ukrainians seeking temporary refuge.The warnings from Allen come as Russia has threatened criminal prosecutions against foreigners captured fighting in Ukraine. Allen also told lawmakers that captured Canadians could become a propaganda tool for Moscow as the Kremlin looks to wage its own information war amid heavy losses on the battlefield.“Foreigners who may be engaged in the country can be used in ways that are difficult and counterproductive to the work that is going on there through the disinformation campaigns that we know that Russia is very apt to use,” she said.TopicsCanadaAmericasUkrainenewsReuse this contentMost popularMost popularWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usContact usComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2022 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Ukraine-Russia war – latest updates
01:50Biden says Nato ‘would respond’ if Russia uses chemical weapons in Ukraine – videoDan Sabbagh and Jessica Elgot in BrusselsThu 24 Mar 2022 13.37 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Mar 2022 01.32 EDTJoe Biden raised the stakes with Russia over its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine by warning that Nato would be forced to respond if the Kremlin resorted to using chemical weapons.Speaking in the aftermath of emergency Nato and G7 summits in Brussels, the US president said that any retaliation would be proportional, though he would not confirm that he would insist on military action.“We would respond,” Biden said, in response to a question about what Nato would do. “We would respond if he uses it. The nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use.”The US wanted to see Russia thrown out of the G20 club of leading economic nations, although Biden complained that wasn’t immediately possible because “Indonesia and others do not agree”.Biden and other western leaders have become fearful that a struggling Russia may try to end Ukraine’s stubborn resistance in the war that has already lasted a month and claimed thousands of lives, with a chemical – or biological or nuclear – attack.Nato leaders: concern about a possible Russian chemical or biological attack dominated the summit Photograph: Getty ImagesThis week it emerged that the White House had set up a special “Tiger Team” to work out how the US would respond if such an attack should take place. But on Thursday, Biden also said: “It would trigger a response in kind” – meaning it would reflect what had taken place.Concern about a possible Russian chemical or biological attack dominated the Nato summit on Thursday. Speaking a few minutes before Biden, UK prime minister Boris Johnson warned of disastrous consequences for Russia should Putin use chemical weapons in Ukraine.“You have to have a bit of ambiguity about your response, but I think it would be catastrophic for him if he were to do that – and I think that he understands that,” Johnson told a press conference.All 30 Nato leaders warned Russia against using chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, arguing in a final summit statement that any such use “would be unacceptable and result in severe consequences”. However, again they did not spell out what the response would be.One western official said on Thursday they thought it would be “highly unlikely” that there would be a direct military response even if Russia used chemical weapons in Ukraine, although any final decision would be driven by the US.That would risk a severe escalation of the conflict, the official said. “We are remaining deliberately ambiguous. We don’t want to say exactly how we will respond because Putin will then price that in to his calculations. We want him to remain uncertain … but we are clear there will be severe consequences,” they added.Masks, protective suits, detection and other equipment would also be supplied by Nato members to Ukraine, Nato’s secretary general Jens Stoltenberg confirmed, reflecting western fears that Russia is trying to create “some kind of pretext”.Ukraine map 24 MarchThe alarm grew after Russia began to spread unproven claims this month that Ukraine had been developing a biological weapons programme with the help of the US. This week Biden said such claims were a “clear sign” that Putin was contemplating a biological or chemical assault.The development, production and stockpiling and use of chemical weapons is banned by an international treaty signed by 193 countries, including Russia and the US.Chemical weapons were used on at least 17 occasions during Syria’s civil war, according to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which has accused the Russian-backed regime of Bashar al-Assad of being behind several high-profile attacks.Nato leaders are also willing to send more powerful weapons to Ukraine after a plea at the Brussels summit from the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, for tanks, rockets and air-defence systems.On Thursday, during a three-hour meeting, the 30 heads of government discussed how they could upgrade and increase their weapons supply – but without provoking Russia to the point where the conflict would lead to a wider war in Europe.Stoltenberg said: “I will not go into the details of the exact type of systems we are deploying … What I can say is that allies do what they can to support Ukraine with weapons.”At the summit, Biden, Johnson and other Nato leaders heard a characteristically passionate call from Zelenskiy for “military assistance – without restrictions”. He asked Nato members to supply more weapons because “Russia uses without restrictions its entire arsenal against us”.01:12Zelenskiy calls for Nato military aid ‘without restrictions’ for Ukraine – videoZelenskiy specifically asked for anti-missile systems, MLRS rocket artillery, anti-ship weapons, air defence equipment – plus tanks and fighter jets. “You can give us 1% of all your planes, 1% of your tanks,” he said.Russian and Ukrainian activists call for European embargo on Russian fossil fuelsRead moreNato leaders discussed what further weapons could be supplied, given that Ukraine had held out for far longer than expected, and which countries were best placed to supply what arms, western officials said.“There was a discussion both about more [military equipment] in terms of more numbers, and more in terms of different equipment,” one official said.But there are limits; officials indicated they thought it unlikely any Nato country would want to provide tanks, for fear of Russian retaliation. A previous proposal by Poland to transfer 28 MiG-29 jets via the US was rejected by the White House, for similar reasons.“We have a responsibility to prevent this conflict from becoming a full-fledged war in Europe, involving not only Ukraine and Russia, but Nato allies and Russia,” Stoltenberg said in a post-summit press conference.Nato members have largely said they will only provide “defensive equipment”, but Russian military errors and Ukraine’s determination to fight back have left the aggressors struggling to make progress without resorting to heavy bombardment that has left the cities of Mariupol and Kharkiv in ruins.Johnson said the UK would double the number of British missiles sent to Ukraine with an additional 6,000 He also pledged an extra £25m to Ukraine’s military to help it better fight Russia.TopicsNatoUkraineRussiaEuropeVolodymyr ZelenskiynewsReuse this contentMost popularMost popularWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usContact usComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2022 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Trump’s chief of staff to take steps to overturn the vote, according to a person with knowledge of the texts.In one message sent in the days after the election, she urged the chief of staff, Mark Meadows, to “release the Kraken and save us from the left taking America down,” invoking a slogan popular on the right that refers to a web of conspiracy theories that Trump supporters believed would overturn the election.In another, she wrote: “I can’t see Americans swallowing the obvious fraud. Just going with one more thing with no frickin consequences.” She added: “We just cave to people wanting Biden to be anointed? Many of us can’t continue the GOP charade.”The contents of the texts were reported earlier by The Washington Post and CBS News. They were among about 9,000 pages of documents that Mr. Meadows turned over to the congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack. The texts detailed Mr. Meadows’s interactions with Republican politicians as they planned strategies to try to keep Mr. Trump in office in the weeks before the riot.The committee obtained 29 texts between Ms. Thomas and Mr. Meadows — 28 exchanged between Nov. 4 and Nov. 24, and one written on Jan. 10. The text messages, most of which were written by Ms. Thomas, represent the first evidence that she was directly advising the White House as it sought to overturn the election. In fact, in her efforts to keep Mr. Trump in power, Ms. Thomas effectively toggled between like-minded members of the executive and legislative branches, even as her husband, who sits atop the judiciary branch that is supposed to serve as a check on the other branches of government, heard election-related cases.Justice Thomas has been Mr. Trump’s most stalwart defender on the court. In February 2021, he wrote a dissent after the majority declined to hear a case filed by Pennsylvania Republicans that sought to disqualify certain mail-in ballots. And this past January, he was the only justice who voted against allowing the release of records from the Trump White House related to the Jan. 6 attack.Ms. Thomas has actively opposed the Jan. 6 committee and its work, co-signing a letter in December calling for House Republicans to expel Representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger from their conference for joining the committee. Ms. Thomas and her co-authors said the investigation “brings disrespect to our country’s rule of law” and “legal harassment to private citizens who have done nothing wrong,” adding that they would begin “a nationwide movement to add citizens’ voices to this effort.”Many of Ms. Thomas’s postelection texts are rambling, with little attention to punctuation, and they run the gamut. She calls Nov. 3, Election Day, a “heist,” and repeats debunked conspiracy theories, including one pushed by QAnon that falsely alleged that voter fraud had been discovered in Arizona on secretly watermarked ballots.The texts show she was communicating not only with Mr. Meadows, but also with Connie Hair, the chief of staff to Louie Gohmert, the Texas Republican congressman who sued Vice President Mike Pence to force him to certify Mr. Trump as the victor of the 2020 election.ImageMark Meadows, left, and Jared Kushner, with whom Ms. Thomas also appears to have been in contact.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesThe text traffic also suggests that Ms. Thomas was in contact with Jared Kushner, the former president’s son-in-law and adviser. Sidney Powell, the lawyer advising Trump’s campaign team known for unleashing wild theories about voting fraud, comes up repeatedly. On Nov. 13, for instance, Mr. Trump included Ms. Powell in a tweeted list of his team’s lawyers. That same day, Ms. Thomas urged Mr. Meadows to support Ms. Powell, and said she had also reached out to “Jared” to do the same: “Just forwarded to yr gmail an email I sent Jared this am,” she wrote. “Sidney Powell & improved coordination now will help the cavalry come and Fraud exposed and America saved.”When some of the president’s other lawyers began distancing themselves from Ms. Powell, Ms. Thomas warned Mr. Meadows not to “cave” to the “elites.”In one text exchange right after the election, she tells Mr. Meadows that he needs to listen to Steve Pieczenik, a onetime State Department consultant who has appeared on Alex Jones’s Infowars to claim, among other things, that the Sandy Hook school massacre was a false-flag operation.She also quoted language circulating on pro-Trump sites that said, “Biden crime family & ballot fraud co-conspirators (elected officials, bureaucrats, social media censorship mongers, fake stream media reporters, etc) are being arrested & detained for ballot fraud right now & over coming days, & will be living in barges off GITMO to face military tribunals for sedition.” She added: “I hope this is true.”Ms. Thomas and Mr. Meadows have been like-minded associates for years, and she bestowed an award on him at a 2019 gathering of conservatives. While Ms. Thomas already had access to the president, White House aides said her influence increased after Mr. Trump named Mr. Meadows chief of staff in March 2020.Mr. Meadows is no longer cooperating with the committee; a lawyer for Mr. Meadows, George J. Terwilliger III, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Nor did Ms. Thomas or the Supreme Court. Mr. Terwilliger has argued that Mr. Meadows cooperated as much as he could without violating Mr. Trump’s assertions of executive privilege, and Mr. Meadows has filed suit against the panel to seek a court ruling to determine the validity of those assertions of executive privilege. Others challenging the committee’s subpoenas in court include John Eastman, a conservative lawyer and former clerk to Justice Thomas who wrote a memo arguing that Mr. Pence had the power to reject Electoral College votes for President Biden. Both cases could end up before the Supreme Court.A New York Times investigation published in February highlighted Ms. Thomas’s postelection activities, including her role on the board of CNP Action, a conservative group that worked to advance efforts to overturn the election even as she was texting Mr. Meadows. In one document, it instructed members to pressure Republican lawmakers into challenging the results and appointing alternate slates of electors: “Demand that they not abandon their Constitutional responsibilities during a time such as this.”Capitol Riot’s Aftermath: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4Trump’s tweet. Weeks before the Jan 6 attack, President Donald J. Trump sent a tweet that ended “Be there, will be wild!” Federal prosecutors and congressional investigators have gathered growing evidence of how this tweet was a crucial call to action for militants in the riot.Judge says Trump likely committed crimes. In a court filing in a civil case, the Jan. 6 House committee laid out the crimes it believed Mr. Trump might have committed. The federal judge assigned to the case ruled that Mr. Trump most likely committed felonies in trying to overturn the 2020 election.Virginia Thomas’s text messages. In the weeks before the Capitol riot, Virginia Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, sent several texts imploring Mark Meadows, President Trump’s chief of staff, to take steps to overturn the election. The Jan. 6 House committee is likely to seek an interview with Ms. Thomas, said those familiar with the matter.Contempt charges. The Jan. 6 House committee voted to recommend criminal contempt of Congress charges against Peter Navarro, a former White House adviser, and Dan Scavino Jr., a former deputy chief of staff, for refusing to comply with its subpoenas.In recently published remarks, Ms. Thomas downplayed her role at the group, but also said she had attended the Jan. 6 rally at the Ellipse in Washington. She added that she “was disappointed and frustrated that there was violence that happened following a peaceful gathering.”She also said she “played no role with those who were planning and leading the Jan. 6 events.” But those comments are undercut by her communications with Mr. Meadows, who was deeply involved in the planning of the Jan. 6 protests.In her one text to Mr. Meadows after the attack that the committee was able to obtain, she only briefly mentions what took place, and only after reiterating one of its animating ideas — that Mr. Pence had betrayed Mr. Trump’s movement.She writes of feeling that “we are living in what feels like the end of America. Most of us are disgusted with the VP and are in listening mode to see where to fight with our teams. Those who attacked the Capitol are not representative of our great teams of patriots for DJT!! Amazing times. The end of liberty.”Ms. Thomas has been a longtime political activist on the far right, and she and her husband have been a frequent presence at partisan political conferences. That has long led to calls for Mr. Thomas to recuse himself from cases in which his wife has an interest, but he has rejected such suggestions. He once said his wife worked “24/7 every day in defense of liberty,” adding, “We are equally yoked, and we love being with each other because we love the same things.”Stephen Gillers, a law professor and judicial ethics expert at New York University, said that while Ms. Thomas is free to exercise her First Amendment rights, her texts crossed a line.“The consequences of what she’s done is that I don’t think that Clarence Thomas can sit on any case involving, even remotely, the conduct of the election, the vote of Congress on Jan. 6, or any cases involving the Jan. 6 committee’s attempts to get information, including the committee’s efforts to get Eastman’s emails,” he said. “He must recuse himself, and should have recused himself in the cases that have been heard up to now.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySite Information Navigation© 2022 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsAccessibilityWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapCanadaInternationalHelpSubscriptions",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/24/us/politics/ginni-thomas-trump-mark-meadows.html,3/24/2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Trump and others who planned the rallies that preceded the violence of Jan. 6, 2021.Credit...Erin Schaff/The New York TimesBy Luke Broadwater and Alan FeuerMarch 24, 2022WASHINGTON — The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol said on Thursday that it would consider contempt of Congress charges against two more allies of former President Donald J. Trump for refusing to comply with its subpoenas.The potential charges against Peter Navarro, a former White House adviser, and Dan Scavino Jr., a former deputy chief of staff, could result in jail time and a hefty fine, and must be approved by a vote of the House. The committee said it would hold a public vote on whether to recommend the charges on Monday.The committee’s actions show how increasingly frustrated top investigators have become with some of Mr. Trump’s closest allies, some of whom have refused to sit for interviews or turn over documents even as hundreds of other witnesses — including top officials in the Trump White House — have voluntarily complied.The committee issued a subpoena in February to Mr. Navarro, who has spoken openly of his involvement in what he calls an “operation” to keep Mr. Trump in office after he lost the 2020 election. He has said he would not comply with the committee’s subpoena, citing Mr. Trump’s invocation of executive privilege over White House materials while he was in office.On Thursday, he called the committee’s announcement an “unprecedented partisan assault on executive privilege.”“If President Trump waives the privilege, I would be happy to testify. It is premature for the committee to pursue criminal charges against an individual of the highest rank within the White House for whom executive privilege undeniably applies,” Mr. Navarro said. “Until this matter has been settled at the Supreme Court, where it is inevitably headed, the committee should cease its tactics of harassment and intimidation.”The committee has sought Mr. Scavino’s testimony since September, when it issued him a subpoena. Mr. Scavino was in contact with Mr. Trump and others who planned the rallies that preceded the violence of Jan. 6, 2021, and he met with Mr. Trump on Jan. 5 to discuss how to persuade members of Congress not to certify the election for President Biden.He also promoted the Jan. 6 “March for Trump” on Twitter, encouraging people to “be a part of history,” and posted messages to Twitter from the White House that day, according to the panel.In January this year, Mr. Scavino sued Verizon seeking to stop the company from turning over his phone records to the committee. Stanley Woodward, a lawyer for Mr. Scavino, declined to comment.A contempt of Congress charge carries a penalty of up to a year in jail. A recommendation from the panel would send the matter to the full House, which would then have to vote to refer the charge to the Justice Department.The only target of the House investigation to have been criminally charged with contempt of Congress so far is Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s onetime top adviser. That case, which is tentatively set to go to trial in July, has been bogged down recently in arguments over whether Mr. Bannon can defend himself by claiming he was merely following the advice of his lawyers when he declined to respond to the committee’s subpoena.In December, the House also recommended that Mark Meadows, Mr. Trump’s final chief of staff, face criminal contempt of Congress charges for his own refusal to cooperate with the committee’s investigation. The Justice Department has not yet decided whether to pursue criminal charges against Mr. Meadows, who turned over thousands of documents to the committee but ultimately refused to sit for an interview.The potential contempt charges come as the committee is fending off a litany of lawsuits from witnesses seeking to block its subpoenas. In response to one such suit, the committee on Thursday laid out more of the case it is building, directly linking the storming of the Capitol to the lucrative fund-raising effort by the Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign that was built on false claims that Democrats had stolen the election from Mr. Trump.In a filing in federal court in Washington, the committee gave its most detailed statement yet of why it believes the joint fund-raising effort was not just a plan to dupe donors into sending the Trump campaign and the R.N.C. millions, but also a leading cause of the mob attack on Congress.In a 57-page document, the committee outlined how, in the weeks after Mr. Trump lost the election, his campaign and the R.N.C. raked in hundreds of millions of dollars sending out fund-raising appeals that called Mr. Biden’s victory “illegitimate” and encouraged supporters to “fight,” including multiple messages sent the same day the Capitol was attacked.“There is evidence that numerous defendants charged with violations related to the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol and others present on the Capitol grounds that day were motivated by false claims about the election,” Douglas N. Letter, the general counsel of the House, wrote in the filing. “In fact, many defendants in pending criminal cases identified President Trump’s allegation about the ‘stolen election’ as a motivation for their activities at the Capitol.”ImagePeter Navarro has said he would not comply with the committee’s subpoena, citing Mr. Trump’s invocation of executive privilege over White House materials while he was in office.Credit...Anna Moneymaker for The New York TimesFor months, the committee’s investigators have examined whether a range of crimes were committed, including two in particular: whether there was wire fraud by Republicans who raised millions of dollars off assertions that the election was stolen, despite knowing the claims were not true, and whether Mr. Trump and his allies obstructed Congress by trying to stop the certification of electoral votes. In recent civil court filings, the committee has begun laying out some of what investigators contend is evidence of criminality.Capitol Riot’s Aftermath: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4Trump’s tweet.

The Jan. 6 House committee voted to recommend criminal contempt of Congress charges against Peter Navarro, a former White House adviser, and Dan Scavino Jr., a former deputy chief of staff, for refusing to comply with its subpoenas.The committee’s filing came in response to a lawsuit filed by the Republican National Committee that seeks to block Salesforce.com, a vendor that helped the R.N.C. send emails, from complying with a subpoena from the panel seeking information about how the Trump campaign and the R.N.C. may have used emails to spread lies about the election.The R.N.C. is asking a federal judge to order a preliminary injury to thwart the House committee.Even after Election Day and Mr. Biden’s victory, the joint fund-raising effort by the Trump campaign and the R.N.C. continued, repeatedly making false claims that the election had been stolen, the committee said. The organizations sent out more than 400 different fund-raising appeals in the first month after the election alone — and hundreds more would follow.“The select committee is concerned about reports showing that the postelection stolen election claims, and related claims that the election could be reversed, were a significant motivating factor for the donors that contributed to President Trump’s fund-raising efforts,” the House committee wrote in its court filing.Mr. Trump and the Republican Party raised $255.4 million over about eight weeks after the election as he sought to undermine and overturn the results with unfounded accusations of fraud. When fund-raising began to fall off after the Electoral College certified the election for Mr. Biden on Dec. 14, 2020, the Trump campaign and the R.N.C. doubled down on their false claims of fraud, the committee said.The organizations later turned to soliciting money through claims that the election could be overturned during the Jan. 6 joint session of Congress.“Every single Patriot from across the Country must step up RIGHT NOW if we’re going to successfully DEFEND the integrity of this Election,” the Trump campaign and the R.N.C. said in one email on Jan. 6, 2021.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySite Information Navigation© 2022 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsAccessibilityWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapCanadaInternationalHelpSubscriptions",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/24/us/politics/peter-navarro-dan-scavino-contempt-charges.html,3/24/2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He joined the firm as a junior stock analyst in 1957 and remained in charge into the 2010s.Credit...Brooks Kraft LLC/Corbis via Getty ImagesBy Robert D. Hershey Jr.March 24, 2022Edward C. Johnson III, a publicity-shy Bostonian who transformed a small company created to manage the department-store wealth of his Mayflower-pedigreed ancestors into one of the world’s biggest investment companies and the nation’s largest administrator of workplace retirement plans, died on Wednesday at his home in Wellington, Fla. He was 91. The death was announced on LinkedIn by his daughter Abigail, the current chief executive of the firm, Fidelity Investments.Mr. Johnson, widely known as Ned, led FMR, Fidelity’s parent company, and drove it to prominence in the 1960s with heavily promoted, aggressively managed “go-go’’ stock funds. In 1974, the company helped popularize the fledgling money-market business by allowing customers to write checks against its money fund. “They were the unquestioned industry leader,” John C. Bogle, founder of the archrival Vanguard Group, which favored a more conservative market approach, less reliant on star portfolio managers, and eventually overtook Fidelity in assets under management, said several years ago in an interview for this obituary. (Mr. Bogle died in 2019.)Mr. Johnson’s exceptionally long tenure — he joined the family firm as a junior stock analyst in 1957 and presided over Fidelity into the 2010s, when he was in his 80s — coincided with a huge expansion of industry products as well as assets, and he eagerly embraced technological advances to provide services that later became commonplace.He first offered retail customers the ability to conduct transactions by toll-free telephone; he pioneered walk-in investor centers; and he revived, and then popularized, funds focused on specific industry sectors, like health care.At his death, Fidelity had more than 500 mutual funds and $11.8 trillion under administration. The company, about half owned by the Johnson family and half by its other employees, had revenue of $24 billion and operating income of $8.1 billion.“He was a true visionary,” said John M. Boyd, a financial services executive and a former Fidelity employee.ImageMr. Johnson in his dining room at the Fidelity offices in Boston in 1994. Credit...John Bohn/The Boston GlobeBesides its huge stable of mutual funds — which included the Magellan Fund, managed by Mr. Johnson before Peter Lynch piloted it to superstardom — Fidelity’s businesses came to include a huge division administering 401(k) plans and maintaining other records for companies.It also provided discount and institutional securities brokerage; was active in real estate; and owned a group of weekly community newspapers and even a limousine and bus service, which was said to have been created when Mr. Johnson was once unable to hail a taxi.The Johnson family, which has Boston roots dating to 1635 and made its initial fortune with the C.F. Hovey & Company department store, has long been one of New England’s leading philanthropists, often anonymously, particularly in the visual arts. Mr. Johnson’s personal art collection is valued in the scores of millions.Edward Crosby Johnson III was born on June 29, 1930, in Boston, and grew up in Milton, a suburb. His mother, Elsie, was a homemaker.Ned was an indifferent student, but after attending various private schools — he once informed a teacher who had corrected his spelling that he would always have an aide to do proofreading — he managed to enter Harvard at 20. He graduated in 1954.After graduation and a stint with the U.S. Army in Germany, Mr. Johnson took a low-level job at State Street Bank before joining the small mutual fund in which his father, Edward II, had invested. He took control of it in 1946.Mr. Johnson quickly showed promise as a stock analyst and portfolio manager under the tutelage of Gerald Tsai Jr., a celebrated gunslinger of a portfolio manager. As the story goes, Mr. Tsai was told by Mr. Johnson’s father one Saturday in 1964 that Mr. Tsai would take over the company, but the senior Mr. Johnson had a change of heart over the weekend and decided that his son should run Fidelity instead.Mr. Tsai wound up selling his stake in Fidelity and moved to New York, where he created the Manhattan Fund and became a billionaire corporate financier. He died in 2008.For decades, Fidelity was the subject of intense speculation about whom Mr. Johnson would designate as his successor. After holding various senior positions at the company and becoming for a time its largest shareholder, his daughter Abigail was named chief executive in 2014. At his death, Mr. Johnson’s title was chairman emeritus.Last year, Forbes magazine ranked Abigail Johnson and her father as the 27th and 60th richest people in the world, with assets totaling $36.7 billion.His only son, Edward IV, is president of Pembroke, a real estate firm affiliated with Fidelity, and his other daughter, Elizabeth, is not involved in the family business. In addition to his children, Mr. Johnson is survived by his wife, Elizabeth (Hodges) Johnson, whom he married in 1960, and seven grandchildren.In 2007, in a rare interview, Mr. Johnson ruminated to Institutional Investor magazine about managing private companies. He declared that while outsiders may be given important roles, family members need to be prominent to provide stability “and an ongoing philosophy or culture of doing things a certain way.”A major element of Mr. Johnson’s managerial style was his adoption of kaizen, a Japanese strategy involving constant incremental improvement that he learned about from a book he had found in the gift shop of a Tokyo hotel. He hired the author to lecture Fidelity executives, made a video about kaizen for new employees and wrote the foreword to another kaizen book, which included Fidelity as a case study.Observers have often suggested that Mr. Johnson’s devotion to kaizen might explain the frequent personnel shifts at Fidelity, including Mr. Johnson’s removal of his daughter Abigail as head of the mutual fund division, which was suffering from mediocre performance, in 2005.A chronic experimenter, Mr. Johnson fomented intense competition among fund managers and other staff, sometimes giving two employees the same assignment to see which would produce the better solution.He fiercely defended the independence and privacy afforded by Fidelity’s family ownership, and he fought efforts by the Securities and Exchange Commission to require the separation of fund governance from that of management-company sponsors.ImageMr. Johnson in 2008. He fiercely defended the independence and privacy afforded by Fidelity’s family ownership.Credit...REUTERS/Brian SnyderHe said he was proud of his dual role as an owner of the management company and chairman of the funds’ board of trustees, insisting that shareholders’ best protection is not “laws or a chairman’s so-called independence” but the “moral fiber” of the leadership. Mr. Johnson also unsuccessfully opposed an S.E.C. initiative to force fund companies to disclose how they vote portfolio shares.Considering his means, Mr. Johnson’s lifestyle was modest. His three-story brick townhouse in the Beacon Hill neighborhood cost $117,500 in 1970 (the equivalent of about $850,000 today) but boasts a garden, shared with neighbors and that, according to Boston magazine, was once the site of grand literary salons frequented by such luminaries as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Charles Dickens and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.A frugal, tough negotiator, and obsessive about detail, Mr. Johnson never built an impressive headquarters. He was content to run his far-flung empire from an unadorned nine-story structure marked “Fidelity Building’’ by small bronze plaques.Although Fidelity was often criticized for lacking transparency and accountability to outsiders, which some say hurt its competitiveness as it saw its share of the fund market shrink in recent years, Mr. Johnson was adamant about maintaining the company’s freedom of action and privacy.“Ned Johnson is an old-style proper Boston Yankee who thinks you’re boasting and acting unseemly if you get your name in the paper,” said the financial journalist Joe Nocera, who writes regularly for The Times’s DealBook newsletter. “When his advisers once told him that Fidelity would have to talk to the press, his response was ‘Fine, as long as it’s not me.’”He did, however, partly lift the veil of reticence and mystique when, to commemorate the company’s 50th anniversary in 1996, he ordered the staff to produce a history that inevitably became the story of the Johnson family. The limited-edition two-volume work was titled “There Will Be Dancing,” a reference to the instruction Mr. Johnson’s father gave for planning his retirement party.In an interview a decade earlier, an intrepid reporter asked Mr. Johnson when Fidelity might offer its stock to the public.His terse reply: “When I’m dead and buried.”Alex Traub contributed reporting.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySite Information Navigation© 2022 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsAccessibilityWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapCanadaInternationalHelpSubscriptions",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/24/business/edward-c-johnson-iii-dead.html,3/24/2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That is more than six times as much as the latest estimate from the Environmental Protection Agency.The number came as a surprise to Yuanlei Chen and Evan Sherwin, the lead authors of the study, which was published Wednesday in the journal Environmental Science & Technology.“We spent really the past more than two years going backwards and forwards thinking of ways that we might be wrong and talking with other experts in the methane community,” said Dr. Sherwin, a postdoctoral research fellow in energy resources engineering at Stanford. “And at the end of that process, we realized that this was our best estimate of methane emissions in this region and this time, and we had to publish it.”He and Ms. Chen, a Ph.D. student in energy resources engineering, said they believed their results showed the necessity of surveying a large number of sites in order to accurately measure the environmental impact of oil and gas production.The largest previous assessment of methane emissions from oil and gas in the United States, published in 2018, reviewed studies covering about 1,000 well sites, a tiny fraction of the more than one million active wells in the country. The new study, by contrast, used aerial data to examine nearly 27,000 sites from above: more than 90 percent of all wells in the New Mexico portion of the Permian Basin, which also extends into Texas.The researchers also took measurements from each site on multiple occasions to account for the fact that operations, and therefore emissions, vary over time. Methane can be released by wells both on purpose, in a process known as venting, and through unintentional leaks from aging or faulty equipment.They found that a small number of wells and pipelines accounted for “the vast majority” of methane leaks, Ms. Chen said, adding, “Comprehensive point source surveys find more high-consequence emission events, which drive total emissions.”Robert Howarth, a professor of ecology and environmental biology at Cornell University who was not involved in the study, called it “very carefully done.” Dr. Howarth has long argued that the E.P.A. substantially underestimates the methane problem. The new study calculated methane emissions at 9.4 percent of gross gas production, which dwarfs the Environmental Protection Agency’s 1.4 percent estimate.Natural gas accounts for about a third of American energy consumption, and because it is less costly than coal in terms of carbon dioxide emissions, many policymakers have promoted it as a “bridge” that could do less damage to the climate while society works on a longer-term transition to renewable energy. But compared to coal, natural gas results in much higher emissions of methane, which is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, but doesn’t last as long in the atmosphere.Understand the Latest News on Climate ChangeCard 1 of 4Ice shelf collapses. For the first time since satellites began observing Antarctica nearly half a century ago, an ice shelf has collapsed on the eastern part of the continent. The 450-square-mile ice shelf was located in an area known as Wilkes Land; the loss occurred in mid-March.A massive leak. Startlingly large amounts of methane are leaking from wells and pipelines in New Mexico’s Permian Basin, according to a new analysis of aerial data, suggesting that the oil and gas industry may be contributing more to climate change than was previously known.Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. A wide stretch of the Great Barrier Reef has been hit by a sixth mass bleaching event, an alarming indicator that the area is under intense stress from the waters around them, which have been growing steadily warmer as a result of climate change..Enduring drought. Drought conditions are likely to continue across more than half of the continental United States through at least June, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said. Nearly 60 percent of the continental United States is experiencing drought.Ramón Alvarez, an atmospheric chemist at the Environmental Defense Fund, estimated about a decade ago that the break-even point — the point above which natural gas would actually hurt the climate more than coal — was a 3.1 percent methane leakage rate. Based on more recent data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Dr. Howarth estimates that the threshold is closer to 2.8 or 2.9 percent.That makes the 9.4 percent leakage rate in the new study highly alarming, experts said, though they emphasized that the rate in the Permian Basin might not be comparable to rates elsewhere.“If this result is similar in other basins — which we don’t know if it is — that would eliminate the greenhouse gas emission savings of the coal-to-gas transition,” said Amy Townsend-Small, an associate professor of environmental science at the University of Cincinnati.If there was good news in the study, it was that a small number of oil and gas sites contributed disproportionately to emissions — suggesting that, if the worst offenders change their practices, it is possible for the industry to operate more cleanly.A rule finalized last year by the New Mexico Oil Conservation Commission bans regular venting and flaring, referring to the practice of releasing or burning off natural gas rather than containing it. Another regulation being considered by the state’s Environmental Improvement Board would require more frequent inspections and repairs of oil and gas infrastructure. (That measure is designed to reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds, a group of chemicals that can have adverse health effects, but oil and gas sites that leak V.O.C.s tend to also leak methane.)The Stanford researchers emphasized that the same methodology they used to quantify methane emissions could be used to identify problem sites and target regulations accordingly.“Aerial technology found high methane emissions,” Ms. Chen said, “but can also help fix them cost effectively.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySite Information Navigation© 2022 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsAccessibilityWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapCanadaInternationalHelpSubscriptions",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/24/climate/methane-leaks-new-mexico.html,3/24/2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An identity thief hacking into his targets’ cellphones. A member of an Eastern European organized crime syndicate.These, prosecutors said, were just some of the customers of Thomas Spieker, a former party producer who was charged on Thursday in state court in Manhattan with laundering more than $2.3 million in Bitcoin for criminals around the world from 2018 to 2021.Prosecutors described Mr. Spieker, 42, as a virtual Bitcoin A.T.M., exchanging cash for cryptocurrency. In addition to the $2.3 million in Bitcoin he was charged with laundering, he was accused of converting more than $380,000 in cryptocurrency into cash.Mr. Spieker was charged with several counts of money laundering and unlicensed money transmission. He pleaded not guilty and was released on his own recognizance. His lawyer, Richard Verchick, declined to comment.Charged with him were:Zashan Khan, 30, and Cosmas Siekierski, 25, of Manhattan, who prosecutors said sold illegal drugs over the dark web, a part of the internet where illegal activity thrives and which is accessible also only though special software. An online storefront the two operated, OVO sweatshop, took its name from the rapper Drake’s record label, October’s Very Own.Anderson LaRoc, 33, of Brooklyn, who prosecutors said targeted 30 victims in an identity-theft scheme.Dustin Sites, 33, of Brooklyn, who prosecutors said helped Mr. Spieker by opening bank and cryptocurrency accounts to help launder money.John Humphrey and Fidello Palermo of Rochester, N.Y., both 51, who prosecutors said took over the OVO sweatshop operation, and who were stopped on a trip to Brooklyn and found with 1.7 kilograms of powder and crystalline ketamine and 140 clear vials of liquid ketamine.All six pleaded not guilty and were released on their own recognizance.“This sprawling web of international money laundering helped drug traffickers, an organized crime ring, and scammers hide their criminal activity and transmit their proceeds around the globe,” Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, said in a statement.Mr. Spieker, who once worked in equities at the investment bank Goldman Sachs, has been a Bitcoin aficionado since the currency’s early days. In 2014, he was the subject of a Vice article that highlighted his work as a DJ working under the name S!CK.Mr. Spieker said in the article that he had used Bitcoin investments to finance a regular dance party in Brooklyn. He claims on his LinkedIn page that he has produced parties featuring the rapper A$AP Rocky, the group Death Grips, and the DJs Araabmuzik and DJ Rashad.At some point, Mr. Spieker appears to have pivoted from musical genres like dubstep and witch house to different undertakings. In a 2018 Facebook post, according to prosecutors, he advertised his money-laundering services, pitching them as being for potential clients who wanted to “STAY COMPLETELY OFF THE RADAR.”From March 2018 to June 2020, Mr. Spieker, working with Mr. Sites and others, opened 29 bank accounts and eight cryptocurrency exchange accounts, prosecutors said. His fee ranged from 4 to 12 percent of the money being laundered.Mr. Spieker’s most prominent customer, whom he described as his “whale client,” was the Eastern European organized crime member, prosecutors said. Mr. Spieker laundered $620,000 for the client, they said.Mr. Spieker is also accused of laundering more than $267,000 for the operator of a Nigeria-based “romance scam,” who used the name Mark Kindly. Mr. Kindly, prosecutors said, persuaded a nurse he met on a New York dating site to send him money under various false pretenses, including that he was being held in a Dubai prison and needed to pay off his captors. The woman gave Mr. Spieker and Mr. Sites over $200,000, prosecutors said.There were signs that Mr. Spieker was concerned about being caught. His Google search history, according to the indictment, revealed searches for “bitcoin money laundering” and articles about people who had been convicted of Bitcoin money laundering.There have been several notable Bitcoin laundering cases in New York this year. This month, a 47-year-old man pleaded guilty in Manhattan to drug trafficking, money laundering and conspiracy for selling drugs over the dark web and laundering his earnings in cryptocurrency. The man, Chester Anderson, operated two digital storefronts that he used to sell 10,000 tablets of generic Xanax, as well as ketamine and GHB to undercover Manhattan district attorney investigators.Last month, federal prosecutors charged a married couple, Ilya Lichtenstein, 34, and Heather Morgan, 31, with conspiring to launder billions of dollars in Bitcoin. Like Mr. Spieker, Ms. Morgan dabbled in music; she made satirical rap songs using the name Razzlekhan.Lananh Nguyen contributed reporting.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySite Information Navigation© 2022 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsAccessibilityWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapCanadaInternationalHelpSubscriptions",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/24/nyregion/thomas-spieker-bitcoin-scheme.html,3/24/2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mr. Bespalov said the fate of Ukraine and Belarus were intermingled.Credit...via Sergey BespalovBy Valerie HopkinsMarch 24, 2022LVIV, Ukraine — In Belarus, Konstantin Suschik was a graphic designer who used his skills to support the opposition movement against President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, the strongman who has held power for nearly 28 years. The movement collapsed in a wave of repression after hundreds of thousands of people protested Mr. Lukashenko’s fraudulent re-election in 2020.Now Mr. Suschik is fighting against him — and against his patron, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia — not by designing political campaigns but with a Kalashnikov assault rifle. And not in Belarus, but in Ukraine.Mr. Suschik, 31, is one of hundreds of Belarusian dissidents who have joined the Kastus Kalinouski battalion, a volunteer unit that is helping to defend Ukraine as part of the official army. Unlike the thousands of foreign fighters who have poured into Ukraine to fight against Russia, Mr. Suschik was already living in exile in Kyiv, one of thousands of Belarusians who fled to Ukraine to avoid prison for their activism at home.“As soon as the war started, we decided to stay here because there is actually nowhere to run, our country is lost under occupation,” said Mr. Suschik, in a telephone interview from a training center in an undisclosed suburb of the Ukrainian capital, as shooting could be heard in the distance.“Kyiv is being bombed and we realized this is probably the only such real chance — the last chance — to win back Belarus, protect Ukraine and actually make this world a better place.”From the outset of the war, Mr. Lukashenko has allowed Moscow to use Belarus, which has a 674-mile border with Ukraine, as a staging ground. Russian forces have poured into Ukraine from Belarus in an attempt — so far unsuccessful — to take Kyiv. Western intelligence agencies are watching closely for signs that Belarus may send in its own troops to assist the Russian attack.ImageMilitary exercises between Russia and Belarus near Baranovichi, Belarus, last month. Russia has used Belarus as a staging ground to invade Ukraine.Credit...Emile Ducke for The New York Times“We have a common enemy, Putin and Lukashenko,” said Sergey Bespalov, a former journalist from the Belarusian capital, Minsk, who went into exile in Ukraine and then joined the battalion. “These are the two people who unleashed this war.”Mr. Bespalov, speaking in a phone interview, said the fate of Ukraine and Belarus were intermingled.“If Kyiv falls, it will be bad for everyone, including Belarus,” he said. “Belarus is already occupied. Russian troops are in Belarus. Russian supplies are being sent from Belarus, Russian soldiers are being treated there, and from the territory of Belarus missiles target Ukraine.”The Belarusian opposition leader, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, expressed on Twitter her support for the battalion, posting photos of billboards designed by Mr. Suschik.“Together forever,” she wrote, using the red and white colors of the Belarusian opposition movement and the yellow and blue of Ukraine’s flag.The battalion was formed in the days after the full-scale invasion began. Belarusians who had been part of other groups, as well as new recruits, announced the unit, named after a 19th-century Belarusian who led an uprising against the Russian Empire, on March 9. The posts on their social media channels end with “Glory to Ukraine! Long Live Belarus!” Both are slogans of each country’s pro-democracy movements.“Every Belarusian is responsible for the situation in Ukraine,” read one fund-raising request posted to Telegram on March 10. “Because silence is also murder.”Mr. Suschik said that more Belarusians were arriving to join the battalion, which has “hundreds and hundreds” of members, though there was no way to confirm his claim. Many are coming from places like Poland and Lithuania, which both host large Belarusian communities following the crackdown that began in 2020.“This is important for me and for many people to disassociate from Lukashenko’s regime, which is supported by only a small part of society, from the majority who support Ukraine or would definitely not participate in the invasion,” said Pavel Slunkin, a former Belarus diplomat who quit the service in 2020 and is an analyst at the European Council for Foreign Relations.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated March 29, 2022, 1:06 p.m. ETReports of sexual violence involving Russian soldiers are multiplying, Ukrainian officials say.The war is reshaping how Europe’s governments spend.Russian forces arrest an occupied city’s education chief during a struggle over changing the curriculum.Four days after the war, Mr. Lukashenko held a referendum, widely seen as rigged, that renounced Belarus’s non-nuclear status, raising the specter that Russia could deploy short-range nuclear weapons in Belarus.ImageIndependence Square in the center of Minsk, the capital of Belarus. Since 1994, the country has been under the rule of President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, who has close ties to Russia.Credit...Emile Ducke for The New York Times“These people in the battalion reveal another image,” Mr. Slunkin said. “They show to Ukraine that Belarusians are demanding freedom and helping to fight for freedom in Ukraine.”He added: “In 2020, the fight between democracy and autocracy took place in Belarus. But Belarus didn’t receive enough support. Now the fight is in Ukraine.”Mr. Slunkin said that he also believed the exiles’ involvement was important for the nation’s long-term reputation, since many Belarusians abroad, most of whom left because of Mr. Lukashenko, were seen as coming from an aggressor country and could face prejudices over the war, similar to what has sometimes happened to Russians who have fled Mr. Putin’s crackdown.Many of the tens of thousands of Belarusians who had fled to Ukraine are now on the move again, Mr. Slunkin said, but they face problems because many never got a residency permit, and, therefore, do not have the same rights to legal protection in the European Union as Ukrainian refugees. Many are also penniless because Ukraine has frozen the bank accounts of Belarusian citizens.Both newly minted soldiers, Mr. Suschik and Mr. Bespalov said that since their country was used as a staging ground by Russia, they had been met with suspicion in the early days of the war and were questioned by the police. While their primary motivation was defeating Mr. Putin and Mr. Lukashenko, both said that they also wanted to show Ukraine and the world that Belarusians did not support the destruction wrought by the war.“Our main mission here is not to lose what we have achieved in 2020,” Mr. Suschik said, referring to Belarus’s protest movement, which won global acclaim for its bravery. “And not to become allies of our enemy, so that Belarusians around the world are not perceived as the same invaders and enemies.’’Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3Ongoing peace talks. Russia said that it would sharply “reduce military activity” near Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv. The announcement was the first sign of progress to emerge from peace talks between Ukraine and Russia in Istanbul.On the ground. Russia’s apparent concessions in the north of Ukraine reflected a successful Ukrainian resistance that has bogged down Russia’s forces around Kyiv’s suburbs and retaken territory near the capital and cities closer to the Russian border.Biden’s comments. During a speech in Warsaw on Saturday, President Biden said that President Vladimir V. Putin “cannot remain in power,” sending U.S. officials scrambling to walk back the ad-lib. On Monday, Mr. Biden stood by his remark, but said it was a personal expression of his “moral outrage.”Mr. Lukashenko dismissed the Belarusian fighters as crazy during a meeting on March 15 with representatives from his country’s security agencies, and he accused them of stealing the money they raised.“They shout, ‘No to war, no to war!’ everywhere, and form battalions of insane citizens,” he said. “Even if the diaspora or someone abroad collects money and sends it to them, 99 percent of this money will settle in their pockets.”ImagePresident Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus at a military training site near Asipovichy, a town in his country, during the joint military exercises with Russia last month.Credit...Emile Ducke for The New York TimesIn fact, the battalion is not particularly well equipped. One Belarusian man in the Czech Republic began collecting money for the battalion to buy bulletproof vests.“Even Somali pirates are better equipped than some of our guys,” the man, Kirill Yakimovich, told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. He has raised thousands of dollars to buy equipment for them.People inside Belarus are helping in other ways, too, like disabling the railway tracks used to resupply the Russian soldiers across the border.“There is no railway connection between Ukraine and Belarus currently,” Oleksandr Kamyshin, the director of Ukraine’s national railway company, told Current Time, a Russian-language media outlet supported by the U.S. government. “I am grateful to Belarus’s railway workers for what they are doing,” he said.Two Belarusian volunteers have already died: Ilya Hrenov, a former computer programmer who had served as part of the Belarusian Territorial Defense Company of the Azov Battalion, was killed after fighting in the battles for Bucha, outside Kyiv, on March 4.On March 13, Aleksei Skoble, 31, who had been fighting for Ukraine since the war began in 2014, was also killed.Russia is recruiting Belarusians to fight, too. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said Wednesday that it had information that Belarusians were being offered a salary equivalent to $1,000 to $1,500 per month to fight for Moscow, as well as benefits for studying at Russian universities.Mr. Suschik and Mr. Bespalov said that they were willing to die as part of Ukraine’s war, even if they ended up fighting their own compatriots.“I understand that if this threat is not stopped now, then my country simply will not exist,” Mr. Bespalov said. But, he added, he was convinced of Ukraine’s eventual victory and believed that the battle would then continue in his home country.“As soon as there is a signal, as soon as we win, everyone is waiting for the liberation of Belarus,” he said. “And many Ukrainians say they are ready to help us with this.”ImageSmoke rising over Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, after a night of heavy Russian bombardment this month.Credit...Lynsey Addario for The New York TimesAdvertisementContinue reading the main storySite Information Navigation© 2022 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsAccessibilityWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapCanadaInternationalHelpSubscriptions",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/24/world/europe/ukraine-belarus-russia-exiles.html?action=click&module=Well&pgtype=Homepage&section=World%20News,3/24/2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kirkpatrick for The New York TimesBy Linda QiuMarch 24, 2022WASHINGTON — Several Republican senators repeatedly and misleadingly suggested during this week’s Supreme Court confirmation hearings that Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson had given uncommonly lenient sentences to felons convicted of child sex abuse crimes.But all of the Republican critics had previously voted to confirm judges who had given out prison terms below prosecutor recommendations, the very bar they accused Judge Jackson of failing to clear.Just 30 percent of offenders who possessed or shared images of child sex abuse received a sentence within the range suggested by nonbinding federal guidelines in the 2019 fiscal year, and 59 percent received a sentence below the guideline range. And in general, it is not uncommon for judges to impose shorter sentences than what prosecutors have recommended.“I listed these seven cases in which you had discretion and you did not follow the prosecutor’s recommendation or the sentencing guidelines,” Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, said at Judge Jackson’s hearing on Tuesday. “I’m questioning how you used your discretion in these cases.”Mr. Hawley’s point was echoed by three of his Republican colleagues: Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Ted Cruz of Texas. Mr. Cruz said the sentences imposed by Judge Jackson in cases involving images of child sex abuse were 47.2 percent less than the prosecutor’s recommendations on average.“You always were under the recommendation of the prosecutor,” Mr. Graham told the judge on Wednesday. “I think you’re doing it wrong, and every judge who does what you’re doing is making it easier for the children to be exploited.”But Mr. Hawley, Mr. Graham, Mr. Cotton and Mr. Cruz all voted to confirm judges nominated by President Donald J. Trump to appeals courts even though those nominees had given out sentences lighter than prosecutor recommendations in cases involving images of child sex abuse. Mr. Graham had also voted to confirm Judge Jackson to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 2021 in spite of the sentencing decisions she had made as a district judge.In 2017, Judge Ralph R. Erickson was confirmed by a 95-to-1 vote to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, with Mr. Cotton, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Graham voting in the affirmative. (Mr. Hawley was not yet a senator.) While serving as a district court judge in North Dakota, Judge Erickson imposed sentences shorter than the prosecutor’s recommendations in nine cases involving child sex abuse imagery from 2009 to 2017, averaging 19 percent lower.In the case with the greatest discrepancy — in which a 68-year-old man pleaded guilty to possessing and transporting such illicit materials — prosecutors asked for 151 months and Judge Erickson imposed a 96-month sentence.ImageJudge Amy J. St. Eve before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2018.Credit... Alex Edelman/Consolidated News Photos, via AlamyJudge Amy J. St. Eve was confirmed by a 91-to-0 vote in 2018 to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. While serving as a district court judge in Illinois, Judge St. Eve imposed lighter sentences than prosecutor recommendations in two such cases. In United States v. Conrad, she sentenced a man who transported images of child sexual abuse to 198 months, 45 percent less than the prosecutor’s recommendation of 360 months.All four Republican senators voted to confirm Judge Joseph F. Bianco to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 2019. Previously, as a district court judge in New York, Judge Bianco sentenced three defendants to prison terms shorter than what prosecutors had sought.At a 2013 hearing for a 25-year-old defendant who possessed and distributed illicit materials, Judge Bianco stated that the court had “discretion” to impose such sentences and spoke of “mitigating circumstances” — an echo of what Judge Jackson repeatedly told the senators during this week’s hearings. The defendant received a 60-month prison term, while prosecutors had asked for “a sentence above the 60 months.”“The guidelines here are just way disproportionate under the facts of this case, and I don’t view them as particularly helpful in this case,” Judge Bianco said at the time. “I disagree with the government that this case is sort of in the heartland of normal cases. There are a number of mitigating factors in this case that I believe are compelling.”ImageThe Senate confirmed Judge Andrew L. Brasher to serve on a federal appeals court in 2020.Credit...Joshua Roberts/ReutersMost recently, Mr. Cotton, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Hawley voted to confirm Judge Andrew L. Brasher to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in 2020. (Mr. Graham was not present for the vote.) As a district court judge in Alabama, Judge Brasher had sentenced a defendant to 84 months in prison, below the prosecutor recommendation of 170 months.In a 2019 hearing before he issued the sentence, Judge Brasher noted that “one of the things that I’m required by law to evaluate and consider with respect to” the defendant “is disparities between offenders who are similarly situated.”That, too, was similar to an explanation that Judge Jackson gave for her sentencing decisions.“Judges all over the country are grappling with how to apply this guideline under these circumstances,” she told Mr. Hawley on Wednesday. “The judge is not just evaluating what the government says in these cases. In every criminal case, a judge has to take into account all sorts of factors.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySite Information Navigation© 2022 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsAccessibilityWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapCanadaInternationalHelpSubscriptions",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/24/us/politics/ketanji-brown-jackson-child-abuse-cases.html?action=click&module=Well&pgtype=Homepage&section=US%20Politics,3/24/2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gretchen Whitmer, Mr. Garbin and other plotters hoped, he said, to set off a chain of events that would prevent Joseph R. Biden Jr. from being elected president and perhaps foment a civil war.“The plan was for us to basically be the ignition to it, and hopefully other states or other groups would follow,” said Mr. Garbin, who pleaded guilty last year to conspiring to kidnap the governor and who testified this week at the federal trial of four other men accused of participating in the plot.Since Mr. Garbin and the others were arrested in October 2020, before there was any attempt to carry out a plan, prosecutors have portrayed the group as a menace to democracy and a vivid example of the dangers of domestic extremism. Lawyers for the four men now standing trial have described the case instead as an F.B.I. trap, in which their clients were targeted for their political views, pushed toward a far-fetched plot by government informants and undercover agents, then prosecuted for their speech.That made the testimony of Mr. Garbin, a militia leader who was neither an informant nor a federal agent, pivotal to the prosecutors’ case against the men on trial. The defendants, Brandon Caserta, Barry Croft, Adam Fox and Daniel Harris, are charged with kidnapping conspiracy and could face life in prison if convicted. Mr. Croft, Mr. Fox and Mr. Harris are also accused of planning to blow up a bridge and were charged with conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction.Wearing an orange jail jumpsuit, his hands cuffed in front of his waist, Mr. Garbin testified for hours this week at the federal courthouse in downtown Grand Rapids. Looking straight ahead, and speaking in even tones, Mr. Garbin told jurors that he had wanted to kidnap Ms. Whitmer, and that he had been prepared for a gunfight with her security detail. Mr. Garbin testified that he had not been pushed into his planning by an F.B.I. informant whom defense lawyers have tried to portray as the architect of the plot.ImageTy GarbinCredit...Kent County Sheriff, via Associated PressUnder questioning by prosecutors, Mr. Garbin pointed out to jurors an AR-15 rifle and a pistol that he said he was prepared to use against the governor’s security detail, as well as a bulletproof vest where he planned to store extra bullets. He recounted a nighttime “recon” mission in which he and other members of the group tried to scope out Ms. Whitmer’s vacation cottage, outside the northern Michigan town of Elk Rapids, but ended up driving aimlessly on her street because they had the wrong address. And he described a training outing where he and others went through a makeshift “shoot house” as practice for storming Ms. Whitmer’s vacation home.“The purpose of the training was furthering our skills to prepare for kidnapping the governor of Michigan,” said Mr. Garbin, 26, who until his arrest worked as an airplane mechanic at Detroit’s international airport. He received a prison sentence of just over six years after pleading guilty and agreeing to cooperate with prosecutors.Another prosecution witness who also pleaded guilty to the kidnapping conspiracy, Kaleb Franks, testified on Thursday that he also intended to kidnap the governor and had not been forced into the plot by the F.B.I. Mr. Franks, who has not yet been sentenced, said he had hoped to die during the attack on the governor. Mr. Franks, 27, said he had been in despair after the deaths of three close family members.Prosecutors said in the months before the arrests, the men, many of whom were militia members, attended meetings and what they described as “field training exercises” to practice shooting and first-aid. In one exercise, they videotaped themselves jumping out of Mr. Franks’s bright-blue PT Cruiser and taking cover behind its doors while they fired rifles.Secretly recorded audio and private messages also showed members of the group repeatedly airing grievances about the government, especially about Covid-19 restrictions, and expressing openness to a range of possible attacks. But there has been vast disagreement in court about how close they were to carrying out any attack, and about what their exact plan even was.Dan Chappel, a military veteran who signed on as an F.B.I. informant in early 2020 after becoming worried about the goals of one militia, the Wolverine Watchmen, pretended to befriend the men who were charged and recorded their interactions for months. As the group began to develop a plan, some of the defendants mused about storming the State Capitol in Lansing or taking Ms. Whitmer in a boat across Lake Michigan or blowing up a bridge to make it harder for police to respond to the kidnapping.But defense lawyers, who are pursuing an entrapment defense, questioned Mr. Chappel’s role in the plot, pointing out that he helped lead militia training and made suggestions about attack plans. The implication was that, if not for Mr. Chappel, who was receiving instructions from the F.B.I., the plan to kidnap Ms. Whitmer would probably not have moved forward.Mr. Chappel, who spent parts of several days on the witness stand, said he believed the men intended to kidnap Ms. Whitmer, kill members of her security detail and eventually kill the governor herself after staging a fake trial. But the exact plans for the kidnapping, a date for which had not seen set, seemed to have still been in flux at the time of the arrests, a fact that defense lawyers have seized on.Mr. Garbin, who had expressed hope of setting off a civil war, testified that he thought they would kidnap Ms. Whitmer, take her out on Lake Michigan, strand her in a boat, drop the motor and leave her there alone. Under cross-examination, Mr. Garbin conceded that no boat had been selected for that mission, and that he did not know how the kidnappers planned to get themselves back to shore.“How were you going to drop this nonspecific motor from this nonspecific boat into the lake?” Joshua Blanchard, a lawyer for Mr. Croft, asked.The trial, now in its third week, is expected to continue into April.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySite Information Navigation© 2022 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsAccessibilityWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapCanadaInternationalHelpSubscriptions",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/24/us/michigan-whitmer-kidnap-trial.html?action=click&module=Well&pgtype=Homepage&section=US%20News,3/24/2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

S. Supreme Court on Thursday temporarily halted New Jersey’s plans to unilaterally shut down an agency that has policed the busy ports around New York City for nearly 70 years in an effort to stem organized crime’s influence.The court’s order came in response to a lawsuit filed by New York officials seeking to block a push by their New Jersey counterparts to disband the agency, the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor, which was formed in 1953 via a bistate compact.New Jersey officials argue that the commission — a product of the “On the Waterfront” era, when the mob exerted major control over the local docks and the unions that work them — has become obsolete. New York officials disagree.Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey had vowed to pull the state’s representative off the commission by next week, a move that would leave the agency unable to operate and end its seven-decade run of fighting to keep the mob off the docks.Moving to head off the shutdown, New York took the rare legal step of seeking the intervention of the Supreme Court, which has jurisdiction in disputes between states.In its ruling, the court granted New York’s demand for an injunction that bars New Jersey from pulling out of the commission or cutting off its funding while the justices consider the matter, leaving two states that are usually allies in an unusual standoff.Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York, a Democrat like Mr. Murphy, hailed the court’s order, saying in a statement that it was “a victory for the safety of New Yorkers and for the health of our economy.” She added that the commission’s work “in combating crime at the port and protecting vital industries is more important than ever before.”Mr. Murphy expressed disappointment at the ruling, but expressed confidence that New Jersey’s decision to shut down the agency would be vindicated.“I will not give up the fight to protect New Jersey’s interests, which are poorly served by a commission that operates without transparency and has long outlived its usefulness,” he said in a statement.Phoebe S. Sorial, the agency’s general counsel, said: “We are very pleased with the court’s decision.”The New York Harbor port system is the busiest on the East Coast and ranks third behind the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, Calif., in terms of cargo traffic. More than 90 percent of the port activity is on the New Jersey side of the harbor.The commission was born after public hearings in the early 1950s revealed organized crime's pervasive influence over the ports at the time. It performs background checks on prospective port workers and has the power to decide how many can be hired and when. In more recent years, it has also used its power to demand that waterfront unions diversify their ranks, which have traditionally been dominated by white men.Fighting corruption remains a key focus. Several years ago, the commission investigated and helped prosecute union officials, shop stewards and foremen over a conspiracy to extort their own union members on behalf of the Genovese crime family.Nonetheless, the commission’s critics argue that it has become obsolete because the mob’s control of the docks ended long ago and that the agency is stifling economic growth by making hiring too difficult.In addition to New Jersey officials, the critics include the International Longshoremen’s Association, which represents most workers at the ports, and the New York Shipping Association, whose members operate the terminals where huge cargo ships are unloaded.Sympathetic to the complaints, Chris Christie, Mr. Murphy’s Republican predecessor, signed legislation intended to dissolve the commission in one of his last acts as governor. After Mr. Murphy took office, the commission sued him in federal court, arguing that New Jersey could not unilaterally dismantle an agreement between the two states that Congress had blessed.The agency won that legal round, but lost when New Jersey appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. At that point, the commission itself asked the Supreme Court to consider the case, which it declined to do last year.That led Mr. Murphy to announce his plans to effectively disband the agency by withdrawing New Jersey’s lone commissioner as of March 28 and ordering the State Police to take over the agency’s duties. The shipping association, which pays fees that provide most of the agency’s budget, said it would stop doing so at the same time.New York responded with its last-ditch legal maneuver.The last high-profile tangle between the two states happened 30 years ago when New Jersey sued New York over ownership of Ellis Island near the Statue of Liberty.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySite Information Navigation© 2022 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsAccessibilityWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapCanadaInternationalHelpSubscriptions",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/24/nyregion/supreme-court-new-jersey-ports.html?action=click&module=Well&pgtype=Homepage&section=New%20York,3/24/2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The legislation is aimed at stopping the largest tech platforms from using their interlocking services and considerable resources to box in users and squash emerging rivals, creating room for new entrants and fostering more competition.What that means practically is that companies like Google will no longer be able to collect data from different services to offer targeted ads without users’ consent and that Apple may have to allow alternatives to its App Store on iPhones and iPads. Violators of the law, which will take effect as early as later this year, could face penalties of up to 20 percent of their global revenue — which could reach into the tens of billions of dollars — for repeat offenses.The Digital Markets Act is part of a one-two punch by European regulators. As early as next month, the European Union is expected to reach an agreement on a law that would force social media companies such as Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, to police their platforms more aggressively.With these actions, Europe is cementing its leadership as the most assertive regulator of tech companies such as Apple, Google, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft. European standards are often adopted worldwide, and the latest legislation further raises the bar by potentially bringing the companies under a new era of oversight — just like health care, transportation and banking industries.“Faced with big online platforms behaving like they were ‘too big to care,’ Europe has put its foot down,” said Thierry Breton, one of the top digital officials in the European Commission. “We are putting an end to the so-called Wild West dominating our information space. A new framework that can become a reference for democracies worldwide.”On Thursday, representatives from the European Parliament and European Council hammered out the last specifics of the law in Brussels. The agreement followed about 16 months of talks — a speedy pace for the E.U. bureaucracy — and sets the stage for a final vote in Parliament and among representatives from the 27 countries in the union. That approval is viewed as a formality.Europe’s moves contrast with the lack of activity in the United States. While Republicans and Democrats have held several high-profile congressional hearings to scrutinize Meta, Twitter and others in recent years, and U.S. regulators have filed antitrust cases against Google and Meta, no new federal laws have been passed to address what many see as the tech companies’ unchecked power.ImageMeta’s European headquarters in Dublin. The company was previously known as Facebook.Credit...Paulo Nunes dos Santos for The New York TimesEurope’s new rules could offer a preview of what’s to come elsewhere in the world. The region’s online privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation, which restricts the online collection and sharing of personal data, has served as a model in countries from Japan to Brazil.The path of the Digital Markets Act faced hurdles. Policymakers dealt with what watchdogs said was one of the fiercest lobbying efforts ever seen in Brussels as industry groups tried to water down the new law. They also brushed aside concerns raised by the Biden administration that the rules unfairly targeted American companies.Questions remain about how the new law will work in practice. Companies are expected to look for ways to diminish its impact through the courts. And regulators will need new funding to pay for their expanded oversight responsibilities, when budgets are under strain from the pandemic.“The pressure will be intense to show results, and fast,” said Thomas Vinje, a veteran antitrust lawyer in Brussels who has represented Amazon, Microsoft and Spotify.Tech industry groups criticized the new law as biased against American companies and predicted it would harm innovation in Europe.“This bill was written to target U.S. tech companies, and its impact will fall on American workers,” said Adam Kovacevich, chief executive of the Chamber of Progress, a trade group in Washington. “European regulations that single out our tech sector threaten American jobs — not just in Silicon Valley, but in cities from Pittsburgh to Birmingham.”The Digital Markets Act will apply to so-called gatekeeper platforms, which are defined by factors including a market value of more than 75 billion euros, or about $83 billion. The group includes Alphabet, the owner of Google and YouTube; Amazon; Apple; Microsoft; and Meta.Specifics of the law read like a wish list for rivals of the biggest companies.Apple and Google, which make the operating systems that run on nearly every smartphone, would be required to loosen their grip. Apple will have to allow alternatives to its App Store for downloading apps, a change the company has warned could harm security. The law will also let companies such as Spotify and Epic Games use payment methods other than Apple’s in the App Store, which charges a 30 percent commission.Amazon will be barred from using data collected from outside sellers on its services so that it could offer competing products, a practice that is the subject of a separate E.U. antitrust investigation. The law will result in major changes for messaging apps. WhatsApp, which is owned by Meta, could be required to offer a way for users of rival services like Signal or Telegram to send and receive messages to somebody using WhatsApp. Those rival services would have the option to make their products interoperable with WhatsApp.The largest sellers of online advertising, Meta and Google, will see new limits for offering targeted ads without consent. Such ads — based on data collected from people as they move between YouTube and Google Search, or Instagram and Facebook — are immensely lucrative for both companies.“Large gatekeeper platforms have prevented businesses and consumers from the benefits of competitive digital markets,” said Margrethe Vestager, the executive vice president of the European Commission overseeing digital and competition policy, in a statement. The companies, she said, will now “have to comply with a well-defined set of obligations and prohibitions.”Meta, Microsoft and Amazon declined to comment. Google and Apple did not respond to requests for comment. Anu Bradford, a Columbia University law professor who coined the term “Brussels Effect” about the influence of E.U. law, said European rules often became global standards because it was easier for companies to apply them across their entire organization rather than one geography.ImageApple and Google, which make the operating systems that run on nearly every smartphone in the world, would be required to loosen their grip.Credit...Ludovic Marin/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images“Everyone is watching the D.M.A., be it the leading tech companies, their rivals or foreign governments,” Ms. Bradford said, referring to the Digital Markets Act. “It is possible that even the U.S. Congress will now conclude that they are done watching from the sidelines when the E.U. regulates U.S. tech companies and will move from talking about legislative reform to actually legislating.”President Biden has appointed Lina Khan, a prominent Amazon critic, to lead the Federal Trade Commission and a lawyer critical of the tech giants, Jonathan Kanter, to head the antitrust division of the Department of Justice.But efforts to change American antitrust laws have moved slowly. Congressional committees have endorsed bills that would stop tech platforms from favoring their own products or buying smaller companies. It is unclear whether the measures have enough support to pass the full House and Senate.European regulators are now faced with enforcing the new law. G.D.P.R. has been criticized for lack of enforcement.The European Commission, the executive branch of the bloc, will also have to hire scores of new employees to investigate the tech companies. Years of litigation are expected as companies mount court challenges of future penalties issued as a result of the new law.“The gatekeepers,” said Mr. Vinje, the Brussels antitrust lawyer, “will not be entirely without defenses.”David McCabe contributed reporting from Washington.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySite Information Navigation© 2022 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsAccessibilityWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapCanadaInternationalHelpSubscriptions",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/24/technology/eu-regulation-apple-meta-google.html?action=click&module=Well&pgtype=Homepage&section=Technology,3/24/2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The talks in Minneapolis failed to reach a resolution by their Monday evening deadline, with the district saying it could not afford to meet teachers’ demands.Megan Peterson, a first-grade teacher, demonstrated in southern Minneapolis on Tuesday morning while her son, a first grader, stayed home with her husband.“It is not something any of us want to be doing right now,” she said.“But this is important for me as a parent,” she added. “This is important for me as a teacher. And it’s important for me, as a resident of Minneapolis, for me to make sure my kids are taken care of.”In a statement on Monday evening, the district said it “would remain at the mediation table nonstop in an effort to reduce the length and impact of this strike.”In St. Paul, the schools were open on Tuesday. A teachers’ strike was averted after the union there, the Saint Paul Federation of Educators, reached a tentative agreement with Saint Paul Public Schools on Monday night.“I believe we have arrived at fair and equitable agreements that respect our collective desire to do right by our students,” the superintendent of Saint Paul Public Schools, Joe Gothard, said in a statement, “while working within the district’s budget and enrollment limitations.”Students in the Twin Cities have already faced pandemic-related disruptions this year. In January, students in Minneapolis learned remotely for two weeks because of staff shortages related to the coronavirus. In St. Paul, some schools also returned to virtual learning for days at a time.The strike on Tuesday left some Minneapolis parents scrambling to find child care.A Monday evening robocall informed Brett Otteson, a father of three, that his children’s classes would be canceled on Tuesday. He found day care at a nearby church, but he is unsure what to expect in the coming days.“The pandemic, as arbitrary as it seemed, was at least justifiable,” he said. “This just seems cruel and indefensible. It’s an unforced error.”Jessica Sutherland, whose three sons stayed with their grandmother on Tuesday, said the closure “kind of felt inevitable, in a weird way.”She continued: “We haven’t had any normalcy in so long, why would we have any normalcy now?”Her children’s teachers, she added, seemed to be doing the best they could to keep parents informed. “At no point during any of this have I ever felt like I saw a teacher giving up,” she said, “during the pandemic and now with the strike.”As schools across the United States returned from winter break during the Omicron surge, many teachers’ unions raised concerns about understaffing because of illness, and shortages of masks and tests. In Chicago, home to the country’s third-largest school district, a week of classes were canceled after teachers’ union members argued that classrooms were unsafe. Schools reopened after a deal was announced on Jan. 10.But pandemic-related issues have not been the sole source of disagreement between the Minneapolis teachers’ union and the school district.Members of the union have asked for more competitive salaries for teachers, a starting salary of $35,000 for most education support professionals, better conditions to recruit and retain educators of color, and enough staff to address students’ mental health needs.Greta Callahan, who leads the teachers’ chapter of the Minneapolis Federation of Teachers, said significant change was needed in her district.“They continue to look at our proposals and say, ‘These are add-ons that we can’t afford.’ And we’re saying, ‘No, you need to rewrite the whole system and do things differently.’”Ed Graff, the superintendent of Minneapolis Public Schools, has said that the district shared many of the same goals. But the district said it had been hamstrung by falling enrollment numbers, which means cuts to school budgets.The district, he said, “continues to face a significant gap between the resources we have — our revenue — and the financial commitments we made — our expenses,” in part because of falling enrollment, rising costs and decades of underfunding.Total enrollment in the city’s public schools from kindergarten through 12th grade fell to just below 30,000 at the start of this school year, down from nearly 33,600 in the fall of 2019.Mr. Graff added that coronavirus relief funds from the federal government were helping the district address budget shortfalls, but would not be enough to cover long-term expenses like salary increases.The teachers’ union has pointed to budget surpluses in Minnesota and said that within the district, money and power have been concentrated at the top while educators have struggled to do more with less.St. Paul schools also face an issue of declining enrollment. About 34,000 students enrolled in the school district in 2021, down from 37,000 in the fall of 2019. The decline prompted a December decision to close and consolidate a handful of schools.According to the union, the tentative agreement reached on Monday increases resources dedicated to students’ mental health, solidifies language about limiting class sizes and increases compensation, especially for educational assistants.Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, said that the unions in both cities had been especially concerned with securing fair pay for educational support staff. She also criticized Minneapolis’s approach to negotiations.“The difference between the bargaining this weekend in St. Paul and Minneapolis were night and day,” she said.It has been decades since Minneapolis teachers last went on strike. Educators in St. Paul last went on strike in 2020 in a bid for more resources to improve mental health support for students and address racial disparities, among other issues.Jay Senter contributed reporting.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySite Information Navigation© 2022 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsAccessibilityWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapCanadaInternationalHelpSubscriptions",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/07/us/minneapolis-st-paul-teachers-strike.html?action=click&module=Well&pgtype=Homepage&section=Education,3/7/2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NATO has activated its “chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defence elements” amid fears Russia could launch a biological strike in Ukraine.
Following an emergency summit of the military alliance on Thursday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters in Brussels the decision comes as the allies move to equip Ukraine with its own biological defences.“Our top military commander … has activated NATO’s chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defence elements,” he said.“And allies are deploying additional chemical and biological and nuclear defences to reinforce our existing and new battlegroups, so we are taking measures both to support Ukraine and also to defend ourselves.”

				Why is this happening?			

Stoltenberg made the announcement as part of a slew of new measures taken by the military alliance to boost its presence in eastern Europe amid a growing Russian threat, he said.  Story continues below advertisement



 NATO is sending four new battlegroups to Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia, Stoltenberg announced, while promising the allies will further support Ukraine in its fight against Russia as the invasion hit the one-month mark Thursday.However, the West fears Russia, which has yet to make significant ground in Ukraine, could escalate the conflict by using biological weapons. Leaders have expressed their fears over such an attack, but have not provided evidence one is looming.

Their worries stem from Russian misinformation that the United States is assisting Ukraine in creating biological weapons. American officials have blasted Moscow for spreading an unproven claim as a possible prelude to potentially launching its own biological or chemical attacks on Ukraine.That fear was enough for NATO to up its assistance to Ukraine, Stoltenberg said.“Allies agreed to supply equipment to help Ukraine protect against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats,” he said.“This could include detection equipment, protection and medical support, as well as training for decontamination and crisis management.”  Story continues below advertisement

If a chemical strike were to happen in Ukraine, the effects of it could spill into other parts of Europe, Stoltenberg said. That means NATO allies have to be prepared for worst-case scenarios.

“Any use of chemical weapons will totally change the nature of the conflict, it will be blatant violation of international law and it will have widespread consequences,” Stoltenberg said.  Story continues below advertisement



 “It will affect the people in Ukraine, but there is also a risk that it will have a direct effect on people living in NATO countries because we can see contamination, we can see the spread of chemical agents or biological weapons into our countries.”

 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday called on Canada and its NATO allies to increase military support for Ukraine as it defends against the invading Russian army.In a pre-recorded video address to NATO’s emergency summit, which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau attended, Zelenskyy warned that Russia poses a threat to NATO nations in eastern Europe.

Trucker protests: Police deemed Ottawa convoy national security threat week before Emergencies Act






Ontario Provincial Police Commissioner Thomas Carrique told the House of Commons’ Public Safety Committee on Thursday that police deemed the so-called “Freedom Convoy” a threat to national security one week before the federal government invoked the Emergencies Act.

The Parliamentary committee tasked with reviewing the emergency powers used to address last month’s convoy protests is divided on the scope of their study.
The Special Joint Committee on the Declaration of Emergency is scheduled to hold its second meeting Thursday evening, and sources with knowledge of the deliberations tell Global News the biggest sticking point is how much to include in the committee’s review.

				Ottawa convoy deemed national security threat a week before Emergencies Act: police				

One perspective would like to see the committee narrowly focused on the government’s unprecedented invocation of the Emergencies Act to address the protests, with an eye to determining if the Liberals appropriately used those exceptional powers.The other side wants a more expansive study which would include the roots of the convoy protests that ground downtown Ottawa to a halt and blockaded border crossings in February, law enforcement’s handling — or mishandling — of the protests, and the federal government’s response.  Story continues below advertisement



 “I think committees normally will work through those issues,” said Sen. Gwen Boniface, one of the three joint chairs of the joint Senate-House of Commons committee.Boniface said this committee will be unique. It includes both senators and MPs, and is tasked with reviewing an unprecedented situation. But “it’ll be up to the committee to work through the issues and answer the questions,” Boniface said.There are a number of other parliamentary committees examining the events surrounding the Liberals’ Feb. 14 decision to invoke the Emergencies Act, a never-before-used law that granted police exceptional powers to deal with the dug-in protest that surrounded Parliament Hill for three weeks.

Speaking to the Commons’ public safety committee Thursday, the Ottawa Police Service’s interim chief, Steve Bell, told MPs that the emergency powers played a central role in dislodging the convoy camp. 
Read more: 

				Where’s ‘freedom’ from here? Canada’s convoy protests are over, but the anger remains				

“From a policing perspective, the legislation provided the OPS the ability to prevent people from participating in this unlawful protest, restrict people from travelling to any area where the unlawful protest was taking place, secure protected places and critical infrastructure … go after the money funding the protest and require third parties to assist us in removing the heavy vehicles that were clogging our streets and creating a safety hazard,” Bell told MPs.  Story continues below advertisement



 “It was a critical piece in our efforts, but it was only one piece.”On top of those federal studies, the government must launch a judicial inquiry into the circumstances leading up to the emergency declaration within the next 30 days.Bonfiace said it’s important to ensure “value for money” in the various concurrent reviews — in other words, making sure the multiple reviews do not repeatedly cover the same ground.The Emergencies Act also sets out in law what the joint committee is supposed to concern itself with — specifically, the “exercise of powers and the performance of duties and functions pursuant to a declaration of emergency.”

But even those in favour of a limited study by the joint Senate-House of Commons committee agree that it’d be hard to determine if the federal government acted appropriately without some consideration of the convoy context.“It really is about making sure that what (the committee does) is valuable to the process and that you get the answers that you need,” Boniface said.“It is more convoluted because of the … perhaps overlapping mandates (of different committees). But I think it can be worked out through the committee with its work and with some goodwill at the table.”  Advertisement

Canada and its NATO allies are standing pat on sending troops into Ukraine, despite multiple requests from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for increased military support against an invading Russian army.
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg reiterated previous statements following the NATO summit on Thursday that the organization is not interested in sending troops into Ukraine to fight Russia.

He said that they will continue to provide support through weapons, funding and intelligence, but are stopping short of peacekeeping.“We have a responsibility to ensure that this conflict does not become a full-fledged war between NATO and Russia,” said Stoltenberg. Allies have made it clear that we will not deploy troops on the ground in Ukraine because the only way to do that is to be prepared to engage in full conflict with Russian troops.”  Story continues below advertisement

He said that NATO allies had agreed to provide Ukraine with greater support in the event of a chemical, biological or nuclear attack and had activated their own defences.  Story continues below advertisement



 “Our top military commander has activated NATO’s chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defence elements. And our allies are deploying additional chemical and biological and nuclear defences to reinforce our existing and new backing groups. So we are taking measures both to support Ukraine and also to defend ourselves.”NATO leaders agreed to provide further support to Ukraine and increase sanctions on Russia and increase defence spending, according to Stoltenberg. The organization also approved four new battlegroups in east Europe.

On Wednesday, in a news conference in Brussels, Stoltenberg told reporters that he expects the leaders to sign off on the deployment of four new battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia.“I expect leaders will agree to strengthen NATO’s posture in all domains, with major increases in the eastern part of the alliance on land, in the air and at sea,” he said.  Story continues below advertisement



 The new multinational battlegroups come on top of four existing combat units with roughly 5,000 troops operating in the three Baltic states and Poland. They were deployed after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014.

For countries supporting Russia like Belarus and potentially China, Stoltenberg said that they need to stop providing aid and instead call for “an immediate, peaceful resolution.”The group is expected to meet again in June, where Stoltenberg said he anticipates countries will provide plans on their updated defence spending and re-evaluate their goals for the organization. 


				Zelensky sends strong message to NATO			

In a pre-recorded video address to a NATO emergency summit, which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau attended, Zelenskyy warned Russia poses a threat to NATO nations in eastern Europe.

Zelenskyy added Ukraine wants NATO to supply it with tanks, planes and anti-ship weapons.“You can give us one per cent of all your aircraft. One per cent of all your tanks. One per cent!” he said.“We can’t just buy it. Such a supply directly depends only on NATO’s decisions, on political decisions, by the way.”

 “At these three summits we will see who is our friend, who is our partner and who sold us out and betrayed us,” Zelenskyy said. The G7 and European Union are also meeting on Thursday. 


				NATO unity important to help Ukraine			

Before the summit began, Trudeau said NATO is more than a geographical alliance, but a “group of countries who stand together because we believe in democracy, in the rule of law, in the defence of human rights and the values that underpin all of our societies.”He added that the “illegal, brutal” invasion by Russia is unacceptable and NATO is “united” in the alliance’s support for Ukraine and condemnation of the continued attacks on the eastern European country.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine one month ago on Feb. 24 has left Europe facing its biggest security threat since the Second World War, and according to Trudeau on Wednesday, a larger threat to the globe.  Story continues below advertisement



 Ahead of the summit, Stoltenberg spoke to the media, calling the ongoing invasion of Ukraine by Russia the “most serious security crisis in a generation.” He added that this summit was a need for a “reset” in NATO’s operations.“We need to do more and therefore we need to invest more and there is a new sense of urgency,” he said.

Regarding goals for the summit, Stoltenberg said NATO allies need to show unity and “address this security crisis together.”British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday accused Russia of crossing a red line into barbarism in its war with Ukraine and said the West needed to “tighten the vice” in sanctions to bring the conflict to an end.“Vladimir Putin has already crossed the red line into barbarism,” Johnson told reporters on arrival in Brussels.He said more sanctions need to be imposed.“It is very important we work together to get this thing done. The harder our sanctions … the more we can do to help Ukraine … the faster this thing can be over.”

The United States assesses that Russia is suffering failure rates as high as 60 per cent for some of the precision-guided missiles it is using to attack Ukraine, three U.S. officials with knowledge of the intelligence told Reuters.
The disclosure could help explain why Russia has failed to achieve what most could consider basic objectives since its invasion a month ago, such as neutralizing Ukraine’s air force, despite the apparent strength of its military against Ukraine’s much smaller armed forces.

The U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the information, did not provide evidence to support the assessment and did not disclose what precisely was driving high Russian missile failure rates.Reuters was unable to independently verify the figures.  Story continues below advertisement



 The Kremlin and Russia’s defense ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Such a high failure rate can include anything from launch failures to a missile failing to explode on impact.U.S. defense officials told reporters this week that the Pentagon assesses that Russia has launched more than 1,100 missiles of all kinds since the war began. The U.S. officials have so far not said how many of those hit their targets and how many failed to do so.

Citing U.S. intelligence, three U.S. officials said the United States estimated that Russia’s failure rate varied day-to-day, depended on the type of missile being launched, and could sometimes exceed 50 per cent. Two of them said it reached as high as 60 per cent.

One of the officials said the intelligence showed that Russia’s air-launched cruise missiles had a failure rate in the 20 to 60 per cent range, depending on the day.  Story continues below advertisement



 Russia has been seen fielding two types of air-launched cruise missiles in Ukraine, the Kh-555 and Kh-101, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank’s Missile Defense Project.Reuters could not determine what a standard failure rate would be for air-launched cruise missiles. Two experts interviewed by Reuters said any failure rate of 20 per cent and above would be considered high.

The United States believes Russia fired air-launched cruise missiles from Russian airspace earlier this month when it attacked a Ukrainian military base near the Polish border, and one of the U.S. officials told Reuters there was a particularly high failure rate during this attack. The strike killed 35 people, according to Ukrainian authorities.Missile attacks have been a feature of Russia’s invasion, with Russia announcing strikes against military targets including weapons depots.The invasion has killed thousands and driven a quarter of Ukraine’s 44 million people from their homes. The bombardment has hit residential areas, schools and hospitals in Ukrainian cities including Kharkiv and the besieged port of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov.Russia, which says its military is engaged in a “special operation” in Ukraine, denies targeting civilians.

North Korea says it test-fired its biggest-yet intercontinental range ballistic missile under the orders of authoritarian leader Kim Jong Un, who vowed to expand the North’s “nuclear war deterrent” while preparing for a “long-standing confrontation” with the United States.
The report by North Korean state media on Friday came a day after the militaries of South Korea and Japan said they detected the North launching an ICBM from an airport near capital Pyongyang in its first long-range test since 2017.The launch extended a barrage of weapons demonstrations this year that analysts say are aimed at forcing the United States to accept the idea of North Korea as a nuclear power and remove crippling sanctions against its broken economy that has been further damaged by pandemic-related difficulties.

 The Hwasong-17 ICBM, which was fired on a high trajectory to avoid the territorial waters of neighbors, reached a maximum altitude of 6,248 kilometers (3,880 miles) and traveled 1,090 kilometers (680 miles) during a 67-minute flight before landing in waters between North Korea and Japan, Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency said.The agency claimed the test met desired technical objectives and proved that the ICBM system would be promptly operated during wartime conditions.The South Korean and Japanese militaries had announced similar flight details, which analysts say suggested that the missile could reach targets 15,000 kilometers (9,320 miles) away when fired on normal trajectory with a warhead weighing less than a ton. That would place the entire U.S. mainland within striking distance.Believed to be about 25 meters (82 feet) long, the Hwasong-17 is the North’s longest-range weapon and, by some estimates, the world’s biggest road mobile ballistic missile system. The missile was first revealed in a military parade in October 2020 and Thursday’s launch represented its first full-range test.

 The agency paraphrased Kim as saying that his new weapon would make the “whole world clearly aware” of the North’s bolstering nuclear forces. He vowed his military to acquire “formidable military and technical capabilities unperturbed by any military threat and blackmail and keep themselves fully ready for long-standing confrontation with the U.S. imperialists.”South Korea’s military responded to Thursday’s launch with live-fire drills of its own missiles launched from land, a fighter jet and a ship, underscoring a revival of tensions as nuclear negotiations remain frozen. It said it confirmed readiness to execute precision strikes against North Korea’s missile launch points as well as command and support facilities.Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters the United States requested an open Security Council meeting on the launch and looks forward to having it on Friday.

The United States also imposed fresh sanctions against five entities and individuals located in Russia and North Korea over transferring sensitive items to the North’s missile program, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said.Thursday’s test was North Korea’s 12th round of weapons launches this year and represented the most provocative test since U.S. President Joe Biden took office.North Korea’s resumption of nuclear brinkmanship reflects a determination to cement its status as a nuclear power and wrest badly needed economic concessions from Washington and others from a position of strength, analysts say. Kim may also feel a need to trumpet his military accomplishments to his domestic audience and drum up loyalty as he grapples with economic difficulties.  Story continues below advertisement



 The North’s tests this year also included demonstrations of a purported hypersonic weapon, a long-range cruise missile and an intermediate range missile potentially capable of reaching Guam, a major U.S. military hub in the Pacific.The U.S. and South Korean militaries had assessed that the North was preparing a full-range test of the Hwasong-17 following their analysis of two North Korean midrange launches in recent weeks, which they said included components of the new ICBM.

Following a highly provocative streak in nuclear explosive and ICBM tests in 2017, Kim suspended such testing in 2018 ahead of his first meeting with then-U.S. President Donald Trump.But negotiations derailed after the collapse of the second Kim-Trump meeting in February 2019 when the Americans rejected North Korean demands for a major release of crippling U.S.-led sanctions against the North in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities.  Story continues below advertisement



 The North’s previous ICBMs demonstrated potential range to reach the American homeland during three flight tests in 2017. The development of the larger Hwasong-17 possibly indicates an aim to arm it with multiple warheads to overwhelm missile defenses.Kim presided over a ruling Workers’ Party meeting on Jan. 19, where Politburo members issued a veiled threat to end his moratorium on ICBM and nuclear tests, citing U.S. hostility.South Korea’s military has also detected signs that North Korea was possibly restoring some of the tunnels at its nuclear testing ground that were detonated in May 2018, weeks ahead of Kim’s first meeting with Trump.Some experts say the North may resume nuclear testing in coming months to claim it acquired an ability to build nuclear warheads small enough to fit on some of its new delivery systems, including the hypersonic missile.

Firefighters extinguished a blaze that torched several rows of seats and a suite area at the Denver Broncos’ stadium on Thursday.
The fire broke out on the fourth level at Empower Field at Mile High just after 2 p.m. and spread to the third level, where it burned at least six rows of seats in two sections. Firefighters quickly brought the blaze under control but were trying to determine if it had spread to other areas of the football stadium, which seats 76,125 people.

Stadium officials said in a statement on Twitter that the fire occurred in a construction zone near the East Club Lounge. At least 100 people were attending an event on the second level, but the stadium was otherwise empty.  Story continues below advertisement



 About 75 firefighters were on scene at the height of the blaze. No injuries were reported.#DenverFireDepartment crews are extinguishing a fire at Mile high stadium, 1701 Bryant. Unknown cause at this time, but fire affected has affected the suite are and the third level seating area. pic.twitter.com/vjnLaQg55X— Denver Fire Department (@Denver_Fire) March 24, 2022Footage from a news helicopter showed several firefighters using water hoses to extinguish the blaze, which sent a large plume of black smoke billowing out of the stadium near downtown Denver. The Denver Fire Department tweeted several photos showing large flames spreading through the seating area.

Capt. Greg Pixley, a spokesman for the fire department, said it appears the fire originated in the suite but was partially suppressed by a sprinkler system. It then spread to the seats, which are made of plastic.

“This type of plastic that the seats are composed of burns with not only significant ferocity, very large flames, but also produces a tremendous amount of black smoke,” he said.  Story continues below advertisement



 Investigators have not said what caused the fire, which burned at least 1,000 square feet (93 square meters).A welder’s torch was blamed for starting a similar fire that burned plastic seats in the west stands of the old Mile High Stadium in January 2002.“Our firefighters have an experience with this type of fire fight. … Any time that you have a fire on an upper level, you’re going to have to move a great deal of equipment to that environment. So our firefighters brought a number of heavy pieces of hose and equipment, saws and the like, to be able to help them extinguish this fire,” Pixley said Thursday.

It has been a taxing time for tens of thousands of Canadian seniors who haven’t been able to file their 2021 tax returns yet.
Global News has heard from a number of seniors scrambling to meet the May 2, 2022 deadline, due to their federal slips not yet arriving.

				Canadians in for another ‘unique’ tax season amid COVID challenges, CRA says				

Dave Sim, 80, of Calgary has been checking his mailbox daily — but no luck yet.“This is getting ridiculous,” he told Global News.Employers and other payers have a deadline of Feb. 28 to provide an information slip, usually a T4 Statement of Remuneration Paid, which informs the recipient and the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) exactly how much was earned in the previous year.  Story continues below advertisement



 But this year, some seniors faced a delay that was no fault of their own.“It gets a craw in my backside,” Sim said. “I can’t believe they (federal government) can’t adhere to their own law.”Sim is on Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) and is worried if he doesn’t get the information to the CRA on time, he may not receive the various benefits he’s entitled to and can’t go without.“No we can’t. We’ll have to go looking to borrow money from the family.”

				Ask the Expert: Filing your income taxes for 2021				

Shirley Maier operates Total Tax & Accounting in Calgary. Not only has she, as a senior, faced a delay personally, so have many of her clients.“I had quite of a few of them panicking,” she said.She agreed that the biggest concern she’s hearing is the possible loss of much-needed benefits if the deadline is missed.“You have to file by the due date, which this year is May 2,” she said. “And if you’re entitled to some supplements, those begin in July.“So if you’re late filing, you could very well miss your first payment.”  Story continues below advertisement



 Federal government responseGlobal News reached out to the federal government for a response.In a statement, Employment and Social Development Canada officials said:“There will be no impact as individuals have until May 2, 2022 to file.”It went on to describe what happened.“In August 2021, Service Canada issued the One-Time Payment of $500 for Older Seniors (OTP) to 3.4 million seniors who will be 75 by June 2022. Service Canada is obligated to issue a T4A tax slip to recipients.“However, due to an administrative error, a limited number (67,797) of OTP recipients received an incorrect tax slip in which the payment amount of $500 was entered into the document twice.”The statement also said Service Canada acted immediately to correct the error and prevent further incorrect tax slips from being sent. It then sent amended tax slips in time for the tax filing season.

But Maier questioned that response, adding she too got her slips late, and she is not 75 years old, so it could not have just happened to those 75 years or older.  Story continues below advertisement



 Global News put that question to the government, but has not yet heard back.

Officials did say seniors are able to log in to their “My Account” on the CRA website to get the updated and correct information.But Maier said that’s not really an option for all her senior clients.“First of all, they don’t have computers,” she said. “Second of all, they don’t have printers. And third of all, they don’t have the wherewithal to sign up for My Account at Revenue Canada or Service Canada.”

Sim does his own taxes but said he will not do them online.  Story continues below advertisement



 “I am old school,” he said. “I like to have the paper and know what I’m doing with it. Then I enter it on the tax return.”Federal officials said all seniors affected by the error should receive their tax slips no later than the week of March 14, a deadline that has already passed for Sim.“I’ve got to wait. What are you going to do?”

Surveillance of wastewater data is suggesting that COVID-19 cases are on the rise again in Canada as provinces have eased public health restrictions.
The resurgence is taking place in Ontario, Alberta, Saskatchewan and parts of British Columbia, according to an analysis by Global News.

				COVID-19 hospitalizations, cases and deaths start to plateau as provinces lift measures				

“The reality is that as all of the restrictions come off in terms of masking and the other measures which have been in place for some period of time, we can expect that more cases are going to be out there,” said Dr. Steve Hrudey, chair of the research advisory group of the Canadian Water Network COVID 19 Wastewater Coalition.“The next few days to weeks are going to be important to watch,” he said.

COVID-19: What is wastewater testing, and how effective is it?






COVID-19: What is wastewater testing, and how effective is it? – Jan 22, 2022

The wastewater signals are correlating with the reported infections through testing, but they paint a more accurate and full picture of how prevalent COVID-19 actually is in the community, experts say.People infected with COVID-19 can shed the coronavirus through their stool, even if they do not have any symptoms, making the testing of a community’s sewage an important tool that can work in tandem with clinical testing data, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC).“Wastewater testing provides a true picture of COVID-19 community health, especially in the current situation when resources for clinical testing may be limited in some areas,” said Anna Maddison, a PHAC spokesperson, in an emailed statement to Global News.So what is Canada’s sewage water telling us about the latest COVID-19 spread?  Story continues below advertisement



  


				Ontario			

In the province of Ontario, following a dip in February, COVID-19 cases started spiking in early March, coinciding with the province’s phased reopening.This is according to the Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table, which is monitoring data from across 101 wastewater treatment plants, pumping stations and sewer sheds in 34 public health units.

					Data source: Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table				



Dr. Peter Juni, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of Toronto and scientific director of Ontario’s COVID-19 Science Advisory Table, said since Tuesday they have seen a “relatively steep increase” in coronavirus prevalence in the wastewater consistently in all regions in the province.  Story continues below advertisement



 He said together with test positivity, the wastewater data is an early indicator that “as expected, we’re seeing a resurgence now.”“There is a lag between what we are seeing in wastewater and in case counts,” Juni said.“It remains to be seen how much of what we’re seeing in wastewater will eventually translate also into hospital occupancy,” he added.





Juni said since only 10 per cent of all infections are reported through testing, the actual case count in the province is likely 10 times higher.“These 2,000 cases are more like 20,000 cases. In fact, when we use wastewater directly to triangulate case counts, we estimate that we’re at between 20 and 25,000 cases of infections daily,” he said.  Story continues below advertisement



  


				Alberta			

It’s a similar story in Alberta, where an upward trend started in early March, according to wastewater samples collected, processed and reported by teams at the University of Alberta and the University of Calgary.

This data covers more than 80 per cent of Alberta’s population.Hrudey, professor emeritus at the University of Alberta, said recent data does suggest that cases are climbing back up in the province, but not dramatically so as of yet.

				Saskatchewan			

Researchers at the University of Saskatchewan are keeping a close eye on the wastewater trends of COVID-19 in Saskatoon, Prince Albert and North Battleford.As of March 16, the viral load in Saskatoon’s wastewater increased by 66.3 per cent compared to the weekly average of the previous week.

					Data Source: University of Saskatoon				



“This increase in viral RNA load is indicative of an increase in SARS-CoV-2 infections in Saskatoon, which — in a partially vaccinated population — may or may not be reflected by new case numbers in upcoming weeks,” the USak researchers noted.  Story continues below advertisement



 “The trend over the last three weeks has been increasing which indicates a double wave for the Omicron wave driven by the BA.2 subvariant,” they said.In Prince Alberta, the viral load in wastewater was up by 96.1 per cent and in North Battleford by 93.2 per cent, data showed.





 


				British Columbia			

However, in British Columbia, the increase is less prominent for now.  Story continues below advertisement



 This is according to the surveillance at five wastewater treatment plants, presenting 50 per cent of the province’s population.Of the five regions being monitored by the B.C. Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) and Metro Vancouver, COVID-19 prevalence was only seen rising in Fraser and North Shore.

				What the sewage data can tell us about COVID-19			

Experts say wastewater surveillance has proven to be an effective tool for tracking COVID-19 trends and predicting future outbreaks.“When you’re using wastewater surveillance, it’s a tool that helps you recognize very early how much community activity there is before people start becoming sick,” said Dr. Donald Vinh, an infectious disease specialist and medical microbiologist at the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC).

				Sewage surveillance: Wastewater could fill COVID-19 testing gaps, experts say				

It is also a harbinger of increased hospitalizations and deaths, he said.Going forward, wastewater monitoring is going to be very important, both in the short term for COVID-19 and in the longer term for other types of germs, Vinh said.  Story continues below advertisement



 However, this type of surveillance also has its limitations as it does not indicate which individuals, households or age groups are infected, he said.

Hidden room above Lviv train station shelters traumatized Ukrainian women and babies

Women, children escape horrors of Russia’s Ukraine invasion






WATCH: Though the flow of refugees passing through Lviv train station is slowing, many women and children are staying hidden in a room above the station’s still-crowded platforms as they escape the horrors of the war – Mar 22, 2022







Valentina Kurushenko ran through a field, carrying her six-week-old granddaughter, as Russian shells exploded over her hometown of Kherson.Kurushenko fled the Russian-occupied city on Friday with her 22 year-old daughter and drove for two days, covering almost 900 km, to reach Lviv, a safe haven in western Ukraine for thousands fleeing Russian troops.Now, the trio wait in a small, hidden room above Lviv train station’s still crowded platforms, alongside dozens of other women and young children who have left everything behind to escape death in some of Ukraine’s most besieged cities.

“Our house is destroyed. Only the walls are remaining,” Kurushenko says through a translator, rocking her sleeping granddaughter in her arms as her daughter sits, head bowed, on a mattress nearby.“We managed to escape to here without almost anything.”It is the same story for many of the women in this room, tucked away on the third floor of the grand Lviv-Holovnyi railway station, an imposing Art Noveau building that stands sentinel over the busy platforms.

					A room on the third floor of Lviv train station has been set aside for mothers with young children with nowhere else to go.				



While the refugee flows have slowed as the war in Ukraine enters its fourth week, Lviv mayor Andriy Sudovyi estimates the train station is still welcoming about 10,000 people per day, from its peak of about 60,000 — but this could rise again if Russian aggression in other areas continues to escalate.

 More than 200,000 refugees remain in Lviv, Sadovyi said, and the refugee crisis was costing the city $1 million per day.As of March 19, it’s estimated 3.4 million people have fled Ukraine, while 6.5 million within the country have been displaced. Many of those people head for Lviv, renowned as the country’s cultural heart, and a western city which has been largely untouched by the devastation wrought elsewhere.

					The city of Lviv, in western Ukraine, is seen as a safe haven for many refugees fleeing war elsewhere in the country.

The streets of Lviv, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, remain relatively calm as strikes bear down on Mariupol, Mykolaiv and Kyiv, but Russian forces fired a warning shot at the city late last week, hitting an aircraft repair facility at the airport.Further strikes on the humanitarian hub that the city has become seem likely. But for now, for many, it is the safest place in the country. 


				A cacophony of confusion			

As the train doors open on carriages from Kyiv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Ternopil, crowds of predominantly women and children flood the platforms, toting small suitcases and plastic bags — whatever they could gather in time.Many of them have left fathers, husbands and brothers behind; men of fighting age, between 18 and 60, are not allowed to leave the country under a presidential decree, in case they get called up to fight.While most of the incoming refugees head straight out the station’s main entrance, converging on a makeshift humanitarian centre outside, complete with medical tents, food stalls and a man playing ‘Let It Go’ on the piano, other, more vulnerable, refugees are directed in another direction.

Up two flights of stairs, and through a set of large wooden doors, is a safe space set aside for women and young children who need emergency shelter while they figure out their next steps.Thin mattresses are laid out side-by-side on the floor, blankets and pillows strewn across their surface. A food bench has been erected at the front, brimming with hot drinks, bread and fruit. The room is a cacophony of confusion — babies wailing, children screaming with joy as they run after each other, unaware of the danger they’ve just left behind, and mothers cajoling those who won’t quiet.

Kurushenko and her daughter found a brief moment of respite here as they await transportation to get to Poland to stay with relatives. As Kurushenko describes her escape, there is a weary, haunted look on her face, typical of many others in this room.The port city of Kherson, near the border of the Russian-annexed Crimean peninsula, was  one of the first in Ukraine to fall under Russian control. Home to more than 280,000 people, much of the outskirts of the city are now destroyed.On Monday, Russian soldiers used stun grenades and gunfire to break up a protest in the city. Videos from the scene show hundreds of protesters approaching a city square before being forced to run away after automatic gunfire breaks out.  Advertisement

Kurushenko says Russians occupied her home before it was shelled and almost completely destroyed.She describes her escape from the city as “running through a field under the shelling.” Her husband remains in Kherson in the city’s self defense unit, as does her daughter’s partner. Her daughter does not raise her head the entire time we speak to her mother, instead staring transfixed into her mostly empty suitcase. 


				'I can't live under the shelling anymore'			

Nearby, Alena Seitch sits on a mattress, her hand placed protectively on the back of her sleeping one-year-old son, as her eight-year-old son wanders around in the background, eating a cookie. The family arrived in Lviv from Sumy, in north-east Ukraine, through a humanitarian corridor. Sumy has been subjected to intense Russian shelling.Seitch was supposed to travel to Poland where she had organized refugee accommodation, but arrived in Lviv to the news that was no longer available. Now, she’s planning on staying with relatives in a town nearby.“I can’t live under the shelling anymore. I’m not ready to sleep in a train station,” she says, through tears.

“I had a train to Poland, but when I realized no one will take us there and won’t provide us with accommodation, I changed the ticket and I reached out to my relatives.”Seitch is a professional gymnast, demonstrated by her delicate posture as she sits on the mattress, her left leg bent underneath her right, her right leg extended in front of her and toes pointed.She was a gymnastics trainer before the war, she explains, showing off videos of the highly decorated young girls she trains in Sumy on her phone, competing at past international competitions. Her girls have all escaped Ukraine, she says, because “they are rich and could do it.”

Seitch has not eaten in four days, because she is nervous and stressed. She says she stayed in Sumy for as long as she could, before the sound of explosions became too much. Her mother remains there, because she refused to leave her home.“When you’re hearing the shelling all the time you think you’re going to be buried under this building,” Seitch says.Everything she is doing is “a sacrifice for my children,” she says, the impact on whom she is visibly distressed over.

While her one-year-old is too young to understand what is happening, she says her eight-year-old has started wetting the bed and even now in Lviv, in relative safety, he holds his head in his hands and adopts the fetal position every time he hears an air raid siren.  Advertisement



 “He’s very, very strong. He is a sportsman like me, but because of this situation, our nerves have mostly reached their limit,” she says.

Every woman in this room has a similarly distressing story. Another mother of two, called Anya, arrived here with her sister and her two young children. She says her parents remain behind in the basement of her home.“I had a call with my parents…. and they said to us a shell had landed, like, not far from them but they didn’t know where exactly. Now they don’t have a mobile connection.”Volunteers rush around in the background delivering hot tea and snacks to vacant faces as children somersault across mattresses nearby. A group of volunteers carrying a stretcher wave people out of the way as they deliver a small figure, draped in a blanket, to another room at the back of the hall.

Olha Slushinska stands at the front of the room and directs newcomers. Her eyes become glassy as she speaks of the people she has met over the past three weeks.She remembers a mother and baby arriving the first day they opened this room, the day after the war broke out, on Feb. 25. The baby was totally naked, draped in a blanket. That moment has stuck with her.Volunteers have come from all over, she says, including an Italian man who showed up not speaking a word of English or Ukrainian and just left yesterday.Orphans and children are also arriving without parents and are being sent to nearby churches and refugee camps set up inside Lviv schools and kindergartens.She speaks fondly about a man who is driving back and forth from here to the front lines, picking up orphans and delivering them here. She hasn’t heard from him in a couple of days and is worried.

Shlushinksa isn’t sure of the capacity of the room but says it is always full, especially at night. She watches women silently grieving, “passing on the emotion to their children.”“Each person is very emotional. One person can seem very stable and do emotional things very easily,” she says.Slushinska has worked here since the beginning of the war and will continue to do so for as long as it continues. She feels duty-bound to do so.“I feel that for people out there it’s more difficult than here. I know a lot of women are in basements seeing explosions,” she says.“So we are trying to support these people as much as possible.”

The federal government has tabled legislation to ensure Quebec does not lose a seat when Canada’s electoral map is redrawn.
It presented a bill Thursday to protect Quebec’s voice in Parliament after it faced losing a seat in an upcoming redistribution based on population.The bill would prevent Quebec’s number of seats dropping to 77 from its current tally of 78.The legislation comes days after a commitment by the Liberal government to protect the number of Commons seats in Quebec in the text of a deal with the NDP.

				Feds to protect number of Quebec’s Commons seats to ensure province doesn’t lose MP				

If approved by Parliament, the bill amending the Constitution Act would make sure that the number of MPs from each province does not drop below the number they had before the last election.  Story continues below advertisement



 Because Quebec’s population has declined, it stood to lose an MP in the upcoming redistribution of seats, while other provinces with growing populations, including Alberta, would gain MPs. The last time a province lost a seat in a redistribution was in 1966.

A number of government departments worked on the text of the bill, but it will be championed through Parliament by Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Dominic LeBlanc.“The seat allocation and the electoral boundaries readjustment process is an important part of our democracy. It ensures the House of Commons reflects the changing nature of Canada’s demographic profile and that all Canadians’ voices are effectively heard,” said LeBlanc.  Story continues below advertisement



 On Thursday, Pablo Rodriguez, the government’s Quebec lieutenant, said the bill is “realistic” and would “solve the problem today, right now in the most practicable way possible for Quebec.”

This article is available exclusively for our subscribers, who help fund our work at the Chicago Tribune.                    A proposed merger between two major railroads will lead to “disruptive” delays to Metra service and exacerbate safety issues for passengers, the commuter rail agency said in a recent federal filing.     The merger would bring more freight trains to the Chicago area, and Metra said it could mean a 400% increase in delays per 100 miles along its Milwaukee District West and Milwaukee District North lines. Freight trains traveling through stations during busy commuter times could pose safety concerns, blocking access to trains and forcing Metra trains to pick up passengers at platforms opposite the side typically scheduled.     Advertisement         Metra’s filing was part of a merger application under review by the federal Surface Transportation Board, which would combine the Canadian Pacific and Kansas City Southern railroads in a $31 billion deal. In the Chicago area, Canadian Pacific shares tracks with Metra’s Milwaukee District West and Milwaukee District North lines, and Metra and west suburban communities have raised concerns about the potential increase in freight trains the merger could bring.          Inbound and outbound trains on the Metra Milwaukee District West line pass each other at the Canadian Pacific Railway Bensenville Intermodal Terminal, as seen from Mannheim Road on March 23, 2022, in Franklin Park. Metra says in a filing that a proposed merger between two major freight lines would cause delays to the commuter service and pose safety threats for customers. (John J. Kim / Chicago Tribune)       If approved, the merger would create the only railroad linking Canada, Mexico and the United States. It would be the first major railroad merger since the 1990s.      Advertisement              Advertisement         It is also expected to bring more freight trains to parts of the Milwaukee District West line, which runs to Schaumburg and Elgin. Canadian Pacific is projecting the merger could add an average of about eight extra freight trains per day to some parts of the line, bringing the total number to an average of just over 11 per day by 2027.     [Most read] FDA approves another COVID booster for ages 50 and up »     Canadian Pacific is not projecting an increase in freight traffic along the Milwaukee District North line, which runs to Glenview, Deerfield and Lake Forest, though Metra said in its recent filing it fears both Milwaukee District lines could be affected.               “The (Surface Transportation) Board should consider that CP has a history of noncooperation and contractual breaches with Metra, that CP’s poor dispatching leads to regular — weekly, and in some cases daily — interference with Metra’s peak and nonpeak train service, endangering and inconveniencing riders, and that the infrastructure on the Metra lines cannot accommodate the trains that the Transaction will bring to Metra’s lines,” Metra said in the filing. “The additional freight and Amtrak trains that Applicants propose to bring to Metra’s lines will degrade the safety and reliability of Metra’s service.”     Canadian Pacific also shares tracks with Amtrak trains, including the Hiawatha service to Milwaukee and parts of the long-distance Empire Builder service out of Chicago. Amtrak has supported the proposed merger, saying Canadian Pacific has consistently earned top marks for causing the least delay to Amtrak passengers and has committed to working with Amtrak to expand and extend service.          Kansas City Southern doesn’t operate in the Chicago area, though it does cross paths with Amtrak near East St. Louis.     Canadian Pacific spokesman Andy Cummings touted the Milwaukee District West’s on-time rate from 2016 to 2020, and said the proposed changes “do not represent a radical shift” in the historic use of the line.     [Most read] Daily horoscope for March 29, 2022 »     The line between Chicago and Elgin is a double track, which will allow more freight trains without affecting Metra service, he said in a statement, adding that freight trains would not run during the busiest commuter hours.     “CP is keenly aware of the importance of efficient rail passenger services and CP has been a good partner to the passenger service operators that use our lines in the United States and Canada, including in suburban Chicago,” he said.       Canadian Pacific is talking with Metra officials about their concerns, he said.     But in the filing, Metra questioned Canadian Pacific’s train modeling, saying it conducted separate modeling that was more rigorous, and showed Canadian Pacific’s plan for train traffic could not work. The agency also said a separate stretch of track touted as a bypass to the congested Chicago area likely cannot immediately handle the amount of extra freight traffic proposed, meaning more trains would be shifted onto the Metra lines.          An outbound train on the Metra Milwaukee District West line approaches the Bensenville station March 23, 2022, in Bensenville. (John J. Kim / Chicago Tribune)       “The bottom line is that Metra’s passengers will suffer,” the agency said. “Serious delays and interference are inevitable.”        Already, the share of riders on the two Milwaukee District lines experiencing freight train-related delays has risen since 2016, and delays remained the same or got worse even as overall ridership fell during the COVID-19 pandemic, Metra said. And extra-long freight trains make the problem worse, because they “hang out” of the closest Canadian Pacific train yard and block sections of track.       Canadian Pacific will also continue to ignore commuter needs, Metra said. Even as the railroad proposes adding more trains to the tracks, in recent years it denied Metra’s requests to add or reinstate service, according to the filing.     On top of delays, the merger will create safety hazards for passengers, Metra said. The way trains are dispatched now “too often require passengers to cross tracks unnecessarily, dodge oncoming freight trains, or circumnavigate idling freight trains at Metra stations.”     Metra is requesting the board deny the merger application, or at least impose conditions on it. That includes measures like transferring to Metra control over who dispatches trains, track and flyover construction and financial compensation — or, if Metra doesn’t get dispatching rights, oversight of Canadian Pacific’s dispatching of trains to make sure it doesn’t interfere with Metra service.     sfreishtat@chicagotribunec.com                        Advertisement                    Advertisement             Advertisement             Advertisement         Latest Business        US consumers still confident, but outlook not as rosy     2h                 US job openings remain near record high in February     2h                    Advertisement                 Advertisement         Most Read         Coronavirus      FDA approves another COVID booster for ages 50 and up     2h                  Drink      White Sox bringing Miller Lite back to the ballpark; Bud Light and Goose Island are out     5:00 AM                  Opinion      Column: Death of Foo Fighters’ drummer, Taylor Hawkins, prompts memories of Kurt Cobain’s suicide note: ‘Empathy!’     Mar 28, 2022                                          Advertisement                                               CONNECT                          TRIBUNE PUBLISHING  New York Daily News Orlando Sentinel The Morning Call of Pa.

Nicole Lee speaks during a news conference at Zhou B Art Center in Chicago on March 24, 2022. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, left, nominated Lee to be the next 11th Ward alderman. (Terrence Antonio James / Chicago Tribune)                    Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s pick for the next alderman of the 11th Ward is a United Airlines director with deep roots in the city’s Chinese American community.     Nicole Lee, director of social impact and community engagement at the Chicago-based airline company, was announced Thursday as the final candidate to replace ex-Ald. Patrick Daley Thompson following his February felony conviction.     Advertisement         She would be the first Asian American woman to serve on the City Council if confirmed by aldermen.     At a news conference inside Bridgeport’s Zhou B Art Center to announce the pick, Lightfoot recounted the discrimination Chinese Americans have faced in this country and some of the challenges Lee herself has overcome. Lightfoot noted Lee is a single mom with two sons and praised her for persevering through adversity.      Advertisement              Advertisement         “Nicole represents what’s good and best about our city,” Lightfoot said.     [Most read] FDA approves another COVID booster for ages 50 and up »     In her remarks, Lee praised the history of the ward, offering a shoutout to the workers who long ago built the city’s canals and calling the area a gateway for immigrants seeking to build a new life.               “The 11th Ward is Chicago,” she said.     Surrounded by schoolmates and her childhood principal, Lee stressed her 11th Ward roots and noted that four generations of her family have lived in the same Chinatown home. She also invoked Bridgeport’s White Sox, saying 11th Ward residents are “grinders” who believe in “winning ugly.”          She said ward residents are looking for someone who is transparent and operates with integrity.     “I’m ready to roll up my sleeves and move the 11th Ward in a new direction,” Lee said.     [Most read] White Sox bringing Miller Lite back to the ballpark; Bud Light and Goose Island are out »     Lee’s appointment would end the wait over who will be the next alderman of the South Side ward, long a stronghold for the Daley family but also home to a burgeoning Asian American population.     Lee has prior experience leading the Chinese Mutual Aid Association, the Local School Council at Haines Elementary School in Chinatown and the Chicago chapter of the Organization of Chinese Americans. Her current job entails managing United’s relationships with charities and spearheading fundraising campaigns, and she’s done similar social engagement work at Premier Bank and BP America.       She has a master’s degree in public policy from the University of Chicago and is a product of Chicago Public Schools, having attended Whitney Young Magnet High School, according to her LinkedIn profile.     “Asian American leader born and raised in Chinatown. … Seeking to expand and amplify Asian American issues and voices by empowering communities and building coalitions for a (better) Chinatown and Bridgeport and a more equitable Chicago,” her resume summary reads.     The mayor’s selection does have a tie to the Daleys. Her father is Gene Lee, a onetime top aide to former Mayor Richard M. Daley who was convicted in 2014 of stealing from charities. The crime did not involve his duties as Daley’s deputy chief of staff.     [Most read] Column: Death of Foo Fighters’ drummer, Taylor Hawkins, prompts memories of Kurt Cobain’s suicide note: ‘Empathy!’ »     Asked Thursday about Gene Lee’s work under Daley, Lightfoot pivoted, “Nicole’s her own person.”       In her speech, Lee said her father was a role model for her and praised his work ethic as a city official who would work hard to address neighborhood issues.     Lee was among 27 candidates for the position, a list that included a few with connections to the Daley family, several from the Asian American community and some with a first responder background.     The influx of Asian American applicants came as leaders from that community called on Lightfoot to appoint an alderman of Asian descent to replace Thompson, pointing to the lack of current representation in the City Council as well as changing demographics of that ward.     State Rep. Theresa Mah, a Democrat who represents Chinatown and is believed to be the first Asian American elected to the Illinois General Assembly, touted Lee’s pending appointment Thursday.     [Most read] Daily horoscope for March 29, 2022 »     “It is exciting and historic that the Mayor has appointed the first Alderman from the Chinese American community,” Mah said in a statement. “I know Nicole and I am confident that she has the right skillset to represent all 11th Ward residents well in City Council.”          Mayor Lori Lightfoot presides during a March 23, 2022, City Council meeting at Chicago City Hall. (Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune)       Josina Morita, chair of the Asian American Caucus, issued a statement calling Lee “the perfect person to represent the 11th Ward, Chinatown and the Asian American community. Her leadership and track record on equity, inclusion and social responsibility are exceptional. We welcome her to the Asian American Caucus.”     Morita is running unopposed for commissioner of Cook County’s 13th District and would be the county board’s first Asian American woman if elected in November.     Lee also received plaudits from Cook County Commissioner John Daley, who serves as the 11th Ward’s Democratic Party committeeman. Daley is the brother of former Mayor Richard M. Daley; Thompson is their nephew.     “I’d like to congratulate Nicole Lee on being selected as the first Asian American woman to serve on the Chicago City Council,” John Daley said in a statement. “I believe Nicole’s background, work experience and many years of community involvement make her well suited to represent the residents of the 11th Ward. … I look forward to working collaboratively with her.”     [Most read] Chicago weather: When to expect the last freeze and snow of spring »     Bridgeport, long an Irish American enclave, has recently seen those of Asian descent surpass whites to make up the largest share of residents, according to the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning. That follows a trend of 2020 U.S. census figures showing Asian Americans as the fastest-growing racial group in Chicago.     Sign up for The Spin to get the top stories in politics delivered to your inbox weekdays.     Asian Americans, whose share of the city’s residents increased by 31% over the last decade, currently have no representation in City Council. In all of Chicago’s history there has only been one Asian American alderman: Ameya Pawar, who represented the majority-white North Side 47th Ward for two terms.        Another factor in play is the ongoing decennial redistricting process of the city’s 50 wards, which all but ensures the 11th Ward will be redrawn to include Chinatown and become the city’s first majority Asian ward, as both the council’s Black and Latino caucuses have for months been on the record supporting the idea.     Thompson resigned a day after his Feb. 14 verdict, as required by state law, meaning the 11th Ward has gone more than a month without representation in City Council. Lightfoot was then given 60 days — until April 15 — to get his replacement through the council.     [Most read] Chicago White Sox trade for OF Adam Haseley, the No. 8 pick in the 2017 draft »     Lee, if approved by the council, would serve until the 2023 election. Political wisdom has it that an incumbent alderman enjoys an advantage over challengers, so if the mayor’s selection decides to run for a full term, that person could have a leg up in the 2023 race.

The city’s Office of Emergency Management and Communications took charge of maneuvering traffic Thursday morning and posted on Twitter shortly before 9 a.m. to inform Chicagoans to expect traffic woes.     Advertisement         Wilson said he hadn’t heard of any complaints about traffic being too bad or any other issues. He said he was “glad” Thursday’s giveaway went as well as it did.     “People need some relief, and they need to be able to get to work,” he said. “It went very well today. People were very happy, and it was a very good day.”      Advertisement              Advertisement         Wilson’s second gas giveaway began at 7 a.m., with cars lined up outside of gas stations ahead of time.

(Stacey Wescott / Chicago Tribune)       Over 450 people were brought on board to help out by pumping gas, managing lines and more. Wilson said most of the people were paid while some wanted to volunteer.               Richard Boykin, a licensed attorney in Illinois and one of the organizers who helped Wilson with both gas giveaways, said Thursday was a “home run.”     “I think Dr. Wilson did a great thing,” Boykin said. “It was a huge success.”          Boykin said the 48 gas stations participated “pretty much at cost” and lowered their gas prices during Thursday’s giveaway.        “They wanted more cars to benefit from Dr. Wilson’s generosity and also wanted to do their part in giving back to the community,” he said.     The $1 million-dollar mark this time around increased from $200,000 in gas given at Wilson’s first gas giveaway. While the donation did multiply, Wilson said $1 million “can’t take care of everybody” who needs help.     “This is a big county with a lot of people, so this is just a small way of taking care of only some people,” Wilson said. “We’ll look at doing it again, depends on if gas prices go up again.”       He added he hopes people feel motivated to make a difference in their lives and feel empowered to contact their representatives and ask them to “consider giving people a break not only on gas prices but high food prices too.”     sahmad@chicagotribune.com                        Advertisement                    Advertisement             Advertisement             Advertisement         Latest Breaking News        Feds raided Chicago home of teen suspected in plot to attack mosque, commit mass murder     30m                 Chicago weather: When to expect the last freeze and snow of spring     2h                 Advertisement                 Advertisement         Most Read         Criminal Justice      Feds raided Chicago home of teen suspected in plot to attack mosque, commit mass murder     30m                  Coronavirus      FDA approves another COVID booster for ages 50 and up     2h                  Opinion      Column: Death of Foo Fighters’ drummer, Taylor Hawkins, prompts memories of Kurt Cobain’s suicide note: ‘Empathy!’     Mar 28, 2022                                          Advertisement                                               CONNECT                          TRIBUNE PUBLISHING  New York Daily News Orlando Sentinel The Morning Call of Pa.

Toews was asked Wednesday whether general manager Kyle Davidson’s decision to trade three players for prospects and draft picks makes the 14-year veteran question his future with the only organization he has ever known.     Advertisement         “I wouldn’t say it makes me question it as much as (that) for the longest time, the thought never entered my mind to leave Chicago,” Toews said. “And in this case, you can’t help but picture yourself and what it’d be like to play for another team and what that experience would bring. That pops into your mind.     “But again, Chicago’s my home. I love the Blackhawks. I love the organization. It’s been my family for a long time, and I’m not ... getting ahead of myself in any way.”      Advertisement              Advertisement               Toews probably had to throw in that caveat so as not to set all of Madison Street ablaze.     But his response aligns with his initial reaction to a major trade last week, the blockbuster deal that shipped up-and-coming forward Brandon Hagel to the Tampa Bay Lightning in a package that included two conditional first-round picks and rookie forwards Taylor Raddysh and Boris Katchouk.               Toews told The Athletic’s Mark Lazerus on Friday that he’s focused on building back his game, but “if (Hagel’s) not a guy that’s a part of a rebuild, then I don’t know. I don’t know if anyone feels safe at this point, with the way he’s been playing and what he’s meant to our team.”     [Don’t miss] Patrick Kane says his Chicago Blackhawks’ future — after trades and now a rebuild — is ‘a discussion for another day’ »      Toews’ stance carries even more weight after Monday’s deal that sent veteran goalie Marc-André Fleury to the Minnesota Wild for a second-round pick that can become a first if certain conditions are met.          That was predictable.     Toews is 33, has had to overcome a concussion this season and is dealing with chronic inflammatory response syndrome. The three-time Stanley Cup winner has one season left with the Hawks at $10.5 million before he becomes an unrestricted free agent.     The Hawks are in a different place.          Blackhawks center Jonathan Toews celebrates a goal against the Senators during the second period on March 12, 2022. (Justin Tang/AP)       Davidson and CEO Danny Wirtz said they’re launching a rebuild that has no timeline, but they threw out three to five years as an arbitrary benchmark to examine whether they’re on the right track to constructing a sustainable winner.       Through the trades of Hagel, Fleury and depth forward Ryan Carpenter, the Hawks have loaded up on picks and prospects: two first-round picks over the next two seasons, a second-rounder this season that has a slight chance to upgrade to a first, a 2024 fifth-rounder and young forwards Raddysh and Katchouk.     “It’s become pretty clear the direction we’re heading in as a franchise, and I’m not going to lie: It was disheartening to see a couple of your really good friends go regardless of what’s to come in the future,” Toews said.     “This group has been through quite a bit this year, on and off the ice. Obviously life’s been weird. It’s been hard for a lot of people, but there’s a lot of challenges that these guys have grown through as a group, and when you cultivate that chemistry and that friendship and that connection with your teammates, you want to keep building off of it. So it’s definitely a little disheartening to see some key parts of our lineup traded away.”           The Hawks managed OK Wednesday with the players who were left.       The acquisition of Raddysh continued to pay off as he scored a first-period power-play goal — his second straight game with a goal — to help the Hawks beat the Anaheim Ducks 4-2 at the Honda Center.     Just as they did on Raddysh’s first Hawks goal, former Erie Otters teammate Dylan Strome and Patrick Kane assisted.     Sam Carrick answered for the Ducks, but the Hawks regained the lead in the second period on Kane’s power-play one-timer off Alex DeBrincat’s seam pass.     Carrick scored again in the third period, but Strome deflected in Riley Stillman’s blue-line blast for the game-winner. DeBrincat added an insurance goal on an empty-netter.     Hawks goalie Kevin Lankinen had 26 saves.

Terrill/AP)       Weeks before the trade deadline, Davidson said he informed Toews and fellow veteran Kane of his overall plan so it wouldn’t come as a shock to the future Hall of Famers.     And Toews credited Davidson for keeping him in the loop.     “I think Kyle is sincere,” Toews said. “He’s obviously had some tough decisions to make already. Looking forward to just being in touch with him on his thought process and what the near future looks like, at least this summer.”     Toews said he appreciates hearing what Davidson thinks about his game.     Toews started the season with a 25-game goal drought but had four goals and an assist in the last six games before Wednesday. And he remains the best option on faceoffs.     “It’s never easy,” Toews said. “It’s always good to hear some honest thoughts from his vantage point and go from there.”     He has said several times that his main focus is on regaining his overall game, and he reiterated that goal.     “My focus is just to continue to get back to where I know I can take my game,” Toews said. “Physically, mentally, I’m enjoying the hard work and the sacrifice it takes to get there, and that’s all I can really worry about.     “Beyond that, there’s a lot of things at play that I don’t control, and ultimately I just want to play great hockey and go out there and show what I’m able to do. It’s been a while since I’ve felt that way.”                        Advertisement                    Advertisement             Advertisement             Advertisement         Latest Chicago Blackhawks        Chicago Blackhawks blow a 4-0 lead in a loss to the Buffalo Sabres: ‘We stopped playing the game the right way’     Mar 28, 2022                 4 takeaways from the Chicago Blackhawks’ 5-4 OT loss to the Vegas Golden Knights — after blowing a 3-0 lead     Mar 26, 2022                    Advertisement                 Advertisement         Most Read         Coronavirus      FDA approves another COVID booster for ages 50 and up     2h                  Drink      White Sox bringing Miller Lite back to the ballpark; Bud Light and Goose Island are out     5:00 AM                  Opinion      Column: Death of Foo Fighters’ drummer, Taylor Hawkins, prompts memories of Kurt Cobain’s suicide note: ‘Empathy!’     Mar 28, 2022                                          Advertisement                                               CONNECT                          TRIBUNE PUBLISHING  New York Daily News Orlando Sentinel The Morning Call of Pa.

The Bears on Thursday signed Bates, a restricted free agent from the Buffalo Bills, to an offer sheet. That gives the Bills five days to match the contract or lose the lineman without compensation.     Advertisement         It’s a projection by the Bears as Bates has only four career regular-season and two postseason starts. They were not the only team to see potential in the former undrafted free agent out of Penn State, who also had visits with the Minnesota Vikings and New England Patriots. The Bills tendered Bates at the low level of $2.433 million, which gives them only the right of first refusal.     General manager Ryan Poles has pledged to upgrade the offensive line, and the Bears signed Green Bay Packers interior offensive lineman Lucas Patrick to a two-year, $8 million deal. They also signed veteran Dakota Dozier to a one-year contract. Patrick said he expects to play center.      Advertisement              Advertisement         The Bears need to replace right guard James Daniels, who left for the Pittsburgh Steelers in free agency, and have to determine a plan at left tackle. Adding Bates would give them a potential starter at guard. Assistant general manager Ian Cunningham was with the Philadelphia Eagles when Bates signed as an undrafted free agent. The Eagles later traded Bates to the Bills.     The last time the Bears successfully landed a restricted free agent from another team was 2006, when they signed nickel cornerback Ricky Manning Jr. from the Carolina Panthers, a move that cost a third-round draft pick.

She had big roles in West End musicals like “Mamma Mia!” and “Blood Brothers” and did turns in everything from Bertolt Brecht to William Shakespeare. A solid career in the theater that, it’s fair to say, is unbeknown to U.S. fans of “Downton.”     As a result, Nicol’s new autobiographical solo show “How the Hell Did I Get Here?” at the Greenhouse Theater Center goes well beyond the usual celebrity retrospective. A modest, kindhearted and warm-centered presence on stage, Nicol not only can draw on her decades of experience in front of a live audience but she can sing, too. And rather than just pulling old audition songs from her trunk, she’s commissioned a composer, Mark Mueller, to write a suite of charming, original numbers, all with lyrics directly relevant to the life story Nicol wants to tell. Mueller accompanies her on piano.     Advertisement         The piece is brand new and you can, at times, tell. But Nicol already has her audience firmly on her side as she charts her first-person trajectory from an ordinary, geeky childhood in the industrial city of Manchester, England (a disclosure: I grew up there, too) to a London career with ups and some big downs, to a late-in-life victory in the lottery of character-actress life, landing on a costume-drama franchise that blew up all over the world.     “Downton” fans, for sure, will have a lovely time. But Nicol’s show will also resonate with young stage performers, or anyone in what is known as “the business,” being as it is a story of resilience and perseverance in an industry not known for its decent treatment of women. Here you have a short-of-stature woman over 60 proudly starring in her own show, but also striving to make this not just a story of her own achievement but a piece resonant to others. I sniffled my way through a good portion of it, although you’ll perhaps have to take that with a pinch of salt, given my personal connection to the era and the material.      Advertisement              Advertisement         I think Nicol could add a bit more “Downton” gossip for the fans, although I understand her desire to limit that cheaper stuff. And the steep set causes her some difficulties that aren’t necessary. But those are small problems: once the “Downton” movie P.R. machine cranks up in May and this show hits New York at the same time, it will do very well, as it would in the U.K., of course.     [Most read] FDA approves another COVID booster for ages 50 and up »     I’ve seen a lot of these kinds of shows in my life as a critic: few have this level of self-awareness and emotional resonance. By now, Nicol has lost both of her parents. But they loom large over her show and we walk out understanding her biggest sadness: they were there for her struggles, but neither of them were around to see everything come good for her.               In this, as in so much else, Nicol is like so many of us.

It has been three years since Joe Ricketts apologized after online media outlet Splinter News published emails in which he made Islamophobic comments, such as “Islam is a cult and not a religion.”     Advertisement         The racist comments have gained a renewed focus during the competitive bidding to buy Chelsea, which was put up for sale after Russian owner Roman Abramovich was sanctioned by the British government over his ties to President Vladimir Putin amid the war on Ukraine.     Paul Canoville, Chelsea’s first Black player, tweeted “a big fat anti racism NO to the Ricketts bid.”      Advertisement              Advertisement               The London communication firm tasked by the Ricketts family with advancing the bid says Joe Ricketts is not involved in the bid, which is led by his son, Cubs Chairman Tom Ricketts. They also have linked hedge fund manager Ken Griffin for the bid.     [Don’t miss] A look at the Ricketts family and their connection to the Chicago Cubs »      “Our family rejects any form of hate in the strongest possible terms,” the Ricketts family said in a statement. “Racism and Islamophobia have no place whatsoever in our society.               “We have developed deep and abiding partnerships with the Muslim community in Chicago, as well as with all communities of color.”     Tom Ricketts was due in London this week to discuss the bid with fans.          “Respect for diversity and inclusion are central to our family’s values,” the family statement said. “If we prevail in our bid for Chelsea, we commit to the club and to the fans that we will actively promote these values.”          The Ricketts siblings — from left, Pete, Todd, Laura and Tom — beside the Cubs dugout at Wrigley Field on Oct. 13, 2009. (Chris Sweda / Chicago Tribune)       There are at least seven known bidders for Chelsea, and the British government has to approve a license for the buyout that cannot see Abramovich receive any proceeds from the sale.

The 29 messages the pair exchanged came in the weeks after the vote in November 2020, when Trump and his top allies were still saying they planned to go to the Supreme Court to have its results voided.     Advertisement         The Post reported that on Nov. 10, three days after the election and after The Associated Press and other news outlets declared Democrat Joe Biden the winner, Virginia Thomas, a conservative activist, texted to Meadows: “Help This Great President stand firm, Mark!!! ... You are the leader, with him, who is standing for America’s constitutional governance at the precipice. The majority knows Biden and the Left is attempting the greatest Heist of our History.”     Copies of the texts — 21 sent by her, eight sent in reply by Meadows — were provided to the House select committee investigating the deadly insurrection that saw a mob of mostly Trump supporters overrun the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The AP attempted to get the same information from the committee, but it declined to comment.      Advertisement              Advertisement         The texts do not directly reference Thomas’ husband or the Supreme Court. But she has previously admitted to attending the Trump’s “Stop the Steal” rally that preceded the Capitol riot. Virginia Thomas also has previously denied conflicts of interest between her activism and her husband’s place on the high court.     Still, the messages show she was urging the top levels of the Trump administration to try to throw out the 2020 election results, and even offering coaching to Meadows on how best to do so. Thomas urged lawyer Sidney Powell, who promoted false claims about the election, to be “the lead and the face” of the Trump legal team.               Meadows’ attorney, George Terwilliger III, told the Post and CBS that neither he nor Meadows would comment on individual texts, adding, “nothing about the text messages presents any legal issues.”     Justice Thomas, 73, has been hospitalized for treatment from an infection. He and his wife did not respond to the outlets’ request for comment.          In February 2021, the Supreme Court rejected challenges to the election. Justice Thomas dissented, calling the ruling not to hear arguments in the case “befuddling” and “inexplicable.”        In a Nov. 5 message to Meadows, Virginia Thomas quoted material that had appeared on right-wing fringe websites: “Biden crime family & ballot fraud co-conspirators (elected officials, bureaucrats, social media censorship mongers, fake stream media reporters, etc) are being arrested & detained for ballot fraud right now & over coming days, & will be living in barges off GITMO to face military tribunals for sedition.”     In a subsequent text the next day, Thomas wrote to Meadows, “Do not concede.”     The messages also suggest that Meadows was willing to continue pursuing ways to overturn the election. He replied to one message from Thomas: “I will stand firm. We will fight until there is no fight left. Our country is too precious to give up on. Thanks for all you do.”       The texts between Thomas and Meadows stop after November 24, 2020. But the committee received another message sent on Jan. 10, 2021, four days after the mob attack on the Capitol, according to the Post and CBS.     “We are living through what feels like the end of America,” Thomas wrote to Meadows in it.

He led off the bottom of the first squaring off against former teammate Carlos Rodón.     Advertisement         Anderson singled to right on the second pitch from the new member of the San Francisco Giants.     “It’s a hit I’ve seen Tim do 300 to 400 times,” Rodón said with a smile. “He hits the ball away like that. See fastball away, boop, takes his hits. Good job from him. Pretty normal to watch Tim do that, just from the different side.”      Advertisement              Advertisement         Rodón, 29, struck out Luis Robert and José Abreu and got Yoán Moncada to hit a grounder to third to wrap up a scoreless first inning.     The left-hander, who signed a two-year, $44 million deal with the Giants this offseason, allowed one run on two hits and struck out four in 2⅔ innings. He got a nice ovation after leaving the game.               “It’s funny, making that first start over here and bringing it home,” Rodón said. “It was cool. Some laughs, a little junk talk but it was fun.”           The Sox selected Rodón with the third pick in the 2014 draft. He went 42-38 with a 3.79 ERA in 121 appearances (116 starts) during seven seasons. Injuries hampered him before it all came together last season, when he went 13-5 with a 2.37 ERA and 185 strikeouts in 24 starts.          “Long road,” Rodón said. “You know the road I’ve been down, but there’s beauty in the struggle. That’s how I got here, going through those ups and downs and learning who I am. It helped.”     He pitched a no-hitter and made his first All-Star team in the breakout season. He was fifth in the American League Cy Young Award voting.     “Did a great job for us,” Sox manager Tony La Russa said Thursday. “I’m really happy he’s not in our league. That means I can pull for him. We had a great relationship, coaches, pitching staff. All of us appreciated what he did.”     Rodón was on the injured list Aug. 11-26 with left shoulder fatigue and dealt with “normal soreness” for a portion of September.       “If he would have stayed healthy, you know what kind of year he would have had?” La Russa said. “Contending for Cy Young, right. Just hope he stays healthy.”     Rodón said of La Russa: “It was a pleasure to play under a manager with a pretty historical career.”     Rodón said there were some talks with the Sox, but he ultimately landed in San Francisco.     “It’s hard to leave an organization that you played your whole career for but it’s part of the game, it’s part of the business and you move on,” Rodón said. “I’m excited to be a Giant. This is a very, very good organization. They won 108 games last year.       “It’s good to be part of a contender, leaving a contender. I’m lucky to be with this organization and be with a good group of guys. And playing with the White Sox was a pleasure.”     When Rodón saw that he would be facing the Sox, he said: “Here we go, I guess. Start it up.”     Rodón surrendered a solo home run to Eloy Jiménez in the second inning.     “Changeup right there, and he smoked it,” Rodón said. “Lot of power, man, lot of power from Eloy.”        Rodón enjoyed the chirping from his former teammates and is looking forward to the new opportunity with the Giants.     “Baseball is such a special game because you make so many relationships,” he said. “I’ve never stepped in a new clubhouse. Just a lot of names, a lot of faces I’ve got to learn. But it’s fun.     “It’s cool to experience a different organization and see what’s different.”                    Sox claim pitcher Yoán Aybar off waivers    The Sox claimed left-hander Yoán Aybar off waivers from the New York Yankees and placed right-hander Jonathan Stiever on the 60-day injured list.     Aybar, 24, was claimed off waivers by the Yankees from the Colorado Rockies on March 20 after being designated for assignment two days earlier. He went 2-6 with a 6.22 ERA, 53 strikeouts and two saves in 49 relief outings for the Rockies’ Double-A team, the Hartford Yard Goats, last season.     Stiever, 23, underwent season-ending surgery on his right lat on Aug. 23. He made 17 starts at Triple-A Charlotte and one relief appearance for the Sox last season.

J.B. Pritzker signs plan to use $2.7 billion in federal relief to reduce unemployment fund debt             By Dan Petrella and Jeremy Gorner      Chicago Tribune |    Mar 25, 2022  at  12:06 PM                                    Thank you for supporting our journalism. This article is available exclusively for our subscribers, who help fund our work at the Chicago Tribune.                            SPRINGFIELD — Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Friday signed a measure to use about one-third of the state’s federal coronavirus relief money to pay off more than half of a $4.5 billion debt in the state’s pandemic-depleted unemployment insurance fund. A plan to erase the remaining deficit is still being negotiated.     The Democratic-controlled state Senate voted 39-16 along party lines Thursday to approve the plan to deposit $2.7 billion of the roughly $8.1 billion in direct aid Illinois received last year from President Joe Biden’s American Rescue Plan into the unemployment insurance trust fund.     Advertisement         The measure also would use about $1.4 billion in surplus state funds to pay off old employee health insurance bills, shore up a college savings plan that has been headed toward insolvency and make additional deposits into the state’s woefully underfunded pension plans.          House Majority leader Rep. Greg Harris, D-Chicago, awaits the start of the budget address by Gov. J.B. Pritzker at the Illinois State Capitol in Springfield on Feb. 19, 2020. (Antonio Perez / Chicago Tribune)       The measure was approved in the House late Wednesday in a similar party-line vote.      Advertisement              Advertisement         Pritzker called the legislation “another milestone in getting Illinois’ fiscal house in order” in a statement issued Friday.     [Most read] FDA approves another COVID booster for ages 50 and up »     House Majority Leader Greg Harris, who sponsored the measure, made similar comments during debate on the bill earlier in this week.               “This is a tremendously important package to resolving our state financial situation,” the Chicago Democrat said. “We are taking care of in a day what took years and years to build up.”     Pritzker and Democrats in the General Assembly previously allocated about $3.8 billion from the federal relief plan for purposes including grants for hospitals, violence prevention programs and infrastructure projects.          But Republicans, who since last spring have repeatedly criticized the majority party for not addressing the unemployment fund debt in the current year’s $42 billion operating budget, maintained that only about $1.2 billion of the federal relief money has actually been spent. That would leave enough to cover the full unemployment fund debt if the other allocations were abandoned..     “This bill leaves a debt in the unemployment system,” said state Rep. Tom Demmer of Dixon, who’s running in the June 28 GOP primary for state treasurer. “The only way to close that debt is to raise taxes and to cut benefits.”     [Most read] Daily horoscope for March 29, 2022 »     GOP lawmakers contend Democrats would rather spend the federal relief money on pet projects in their districts during an election year than on shoring up the unemployment fund.     Ongoing negotiations with business and labor groups over separate legislation to fill the remaining insurance fund hole have touched on the possibility of issuing bonds that likely would be repaid through increased payroll taxes on businesses and reduced or shortened benefits.       “I think it’s incredibly disingenuous this afternoon and after last night’s action in the House for Democrats to be painting today’s action as a win or a success for fiscal responsibility,” said Sen. Donald DeWitte, a St. Charles Republican. “Employers who have been treated with absolute disregard throughout this pandemic will literally be left holding the bag and will be responsible for filling the remaining deficit in the unemployment insurance trust fund.”     Sen. Michael Hastings, a Democrat from Frankfort, chided Republicans for criticizing a proposal that would pay off “major debt” that Illinois owes, such as the College Illinois fund and various group health insurance bills.     “Guys, I understand the political posture of both sides of this chamber,” Hastings said to the Republicans. “But to say, to vote no, to a bill that business is not opposed to, to vote no to a bill that labor is not opposed to, is hypocritical at its finest moment.”     [Most read] White Sox bringing Miller Lite back to the ballpark; Bud Light and Goose Island are out »     A coalition of organizations representing manufacturers, retailers and other businesses said in a statement Thursday they “appreciate the governor and members of the General Assembly for taking this positive step” and are “hopeful that negotiations will continue to resolve the remaining balance of this unprecedented deficit.”       In responses to the GOP accusations of pork barrel spending, Democrats counter that federal relief money that’s already been budgeted is for necessary expenses allowed under federal guidelines and that Republicans are the ones playing election-year politics.     “Not one bill to fix this problem or to address this problem has been introduced by your side,” Harris said during Wednesday’s House debate. “We’ve seen a lot of press releases, we’ve seen a lot of stunts, we’ve seen a lot of letters, but nothing to really solve the problem.”     Illinois, like a host of other states, borrowed from the federal government in the early phase of the pandemic to keep checks flowing to out-of-work residents as businesses shut down, in large part due to Pritzker’s executive orders. The state unemployment agency was overwhelmed with new jobless claims — both real and fraudulent.     The Illinois Department of Employment Security has yet to say exactly how much it believes was paid out to fraudsters using stolen identities.     [Most read] Column: Death of Foo Fighters’ drummer, Taylor Hawkins, prompts memories of Kurt Cobain’s suicide note: ‘Empathy!’ »     During a Senate confirmation hearing this week, IDES Director Kristin Richards acknowledged that other states have released estimates, including Michigan, which has estimated it paid out $8.5 billion in fraudulent claims.     Lawmakers are up against an April 1 deadline to allocate the federal relief dollars to the unemployment fund. If they don’t act by then, rules from the U.S. Treasury Department would prohibit Illinois from reducing the amount or length of unemployment benefits until 2025.     The state has to pay off interest accrued on the money borrowed for the unemployment fund, which is approaching $42 million and would grow to about $80 million if left unpaid, by September and the remaining debt by November.     Earlier this month, Illinois Democrats in Congress championed a bill that would waive interest payments on federal unemployment loans to help Illinois and other states recover financially through the pandemic.     “Interest payments are penalty payments that we pay, which is essentially nothing more than setting taxpayer dollars on fire,” Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza, who is also up for reelection this year, said last week and supports a waiver on interest.

In addition to addressing the unemployment fund debt, the measure heading to Pritzker’s desk devotes $300 million toward the state’s $139.9 billion unfunded pension liabilities, reducing the long-term liability by roughly $1 billion, supporters estimate.     It also repays nearly a $900 million backlog in the group health insurance plan for state employees and directs $230 million toward paying off what’s owed to College Illinois, the state’s onetime prepaid tuition program.     Advertisement         Since the start of the year, Democrats and Republicans in the state legislature have been working with the governor’s office and IDES, along with business and labor interests, to figure out a way to pay off the debt.     Advertisement         Rep. Jay Hoffman, a Swansea Democrat, accused House Republicans of undermining those negotiations.        “At some point, you’ll become part of the solution, and I can’t wait to (get to) that point,” Hoffman said. “We made a commitment that this was going to be one of our top priorities in using these federal funds to close this gap that put it in range of getting an agreement between business and labor.”     Petrella reported from Chicago.     dpetrella@chicagotribune.com     jgorner@chicagotribune.com                        Advertisement                    Advertisement             Advertisement             Advertisement         Latest Politics        State Senate rejects a second Pritzker nominee to Illinois Prisoner Review Board     Mar 28, 2022                 Nicole Lee confirmed as Chicago’s newest alderman; here’s a look at the woman behind the historic 11th Ward appointment     Mar 28, 2022                    Advertisement                 Advertisement         Most Read         Coronavirus      FDA approves another COVID booster for ages 50 and up     2h                  Drink      White Sox bringing Miller Lite back to the ballpark; Bud Light and Goose Island are out     5:00 AM                  Opinion      Column: Death of Foo Fighters’ drummer, Taylor Hawkins, prompts memories of Kurt Cobain’s suicide note: ‘Empathy!’     Mar 28, 2022                        Advertisement                              Advertisement                                               CONNECT                          TRIBUNE PUBLISHING  New York Daily News Orlando Sentinel The Morning Call of Pa.

Lisa Schneider-Fabes and the unnamed defendant “deceptively sought to influence the outcome of that election for an improper purpose — namely to attempt to put in place at the Chicago Teachers Union a leadership that has a friendlier relationship with city leaders,” according to the lawsuit filed Thursday in Cook County Circuit Court.     Advertisement         When asked if Jane Doe is the mayor herself, CTU attorney Michael Persoon said, “We think that there’s a conspiracy to intervene unlawfully and interfere with the normal democratic processes of the Chicago Teachers Union, and we’re going to take all efforts to discover the extent of that conspiracy. Whatever the results of that investigation are, we’ll follow that, just like any prosecutor, like the U.S. attorney would do.”     Last month union leaders discovered Schneider-Fabes was behind a targeted social media campaign waged by Chicago Teachers United. On its website the group promoted itself as “an independent organization that believes teachers deserve strong union leadership that supports efforts to ensure great outcomes for our children and to protect wages and benefits for our teachers.”      Advertisement              Advertisement         The union lawsuit alleges Chicago Teachers United is a “front organization working to make mischief within Chicago Teachers Union for the political and personal benefit of Mayor Lori Lightfoot.”     Chicago Teachers United, which noted it is “not authorized by any candidate committee,” encouraged visitors of its site to go to the Members First Caucus website and learn about its candidates, who are challenging the current CTU leaders. The Chicago Teachers United website was recently deactivated, internet archive records show.               Schneider-Fabes issued a statement to the Tribune Thursday: “While Chicago Teachers United has not had the opportunity to review any legal action CTU may file, it has acted at all times consistent with applicable law. Prior to CTU’s announcement, Chicago Teachers United already permanently ceased all operations to avoid any further distractions from the important issues facing CPS and its staff, students and parents.”     The mayor’s office said Thursday she “has had no involvement in any internal union election.”          Persoon pointed to an alleged job posting for an executive director to begin working with Chicago Teachers United in March.     “It seems that they still have ongoing operations,” Persoon said. “And from my investigation, the only thing that Chicago Teachers United existed to do was to interfere with Chicago Teachers Union elections. So until and unless we get an unequivocal statement, and probably a court order enforcing that, that Ms. Schneider-Fabes and her organization are never, ever, ever going to interfere with Chicago Teachers Union elections, we need to press the lawsuit.”          CTU President Jesse Sharkey talks to reporters last August about ongoing COVID-19 safety concerns in schools. The union now claims in a lawsuit that an outside group supporting Mayor Lori Lightfoot is interfering with upcoming union elections. (Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune)       The union’s governing body — the 600-member House of Delegates — passed a resolution last month condemning outside interference in union elections. The union has about 25,000 members.     CTU’s leaders — including President Jesse Sharkey and Vice President Stacy Davis Gates — hail from the Caucus of Rank and File Educators. The Members First Caucus announced a challenge to the CORE group in January.       In a statement Thursday, Members First said it “stands against outside interference in our internal election. Stacy Davis Gates and her caucus have hurt so many Chicago families and union members with the toxic environment they created. That is why union members want change and we don’t need any outside groups to help us deliver that change to the CTU.”     The union says its rules prohibit candidates for office from accepting or using contributions of money or anything of value (such as facilities, equipment or supplies) received from people who are not Chicago Teachers Union members. Federal labor law says employers may not contribute funds, directly or indirectly, in support of the candidacy of any person for union office under any conditions.     Schneider-Fabes resigned from Lightfoot’s administration months after the mayor’s 2019 election as the city’s watchdog investigated the arrangement that allowed Schneider-Fabes to collect a taxpayer-funded paycheck while she lived in Wilmette. She is a Wilmette School District 39 board member.     In its suit, the union is claiming contract interference, civil conspiracy and unfair competition under the Illinois Deceptive Trade Practices Act. The union is asking a judge to order the defendants and those acting in concert with them to stop providing support to union candidates or maintaining deceptive websites that would lead a person to believe the information published was from the Chicago Teachers Union.       Union leaders have had a contentious relationship with Lightfoot since she assumed office nearly three years ago. The latest bitter battle was over the union’s demands for more COVID-19 protections at the peak of the omicron surge in January. The district canceled classes for five days as the two sides hammered out a safety agreement.        Then, last week, Chicago Public Schools moved to a mask-optional policy despite a provision in the union deal for universal masking. CTU said the district relaxed the mask requirements unilaterally, without bargaining. Union leaders blamed Lightfoot and took their case to a state labor panel. A hearing is scheduled for April after the union lost a request last week for an emergency injunction.     The union’s May 20 election is shaping up to be the most competitive in years. Several challengers have come forward in recent months. Besides Members First, the Real Caucus and Change the Conversation have announced their candidate slates.     Sharkey said Thursday Change the Conversation is tied to Educators for Excellence, a national organization the union alleges in its suit wants to “implement contract changes including negotiating a ‘thin’ contract that would undermine members’ existing rights.” Educators for Excellence, which is not a defendant in the suit, did not immediately return a Tribune request for comment, nor did a Change the Conversation representative.     Advertisement         In the 2019 election, the CORE group defeated Members First with 66% of the vote. Sharkey announced last month he is not seeking reelection.

The Washington Post,,C,"U.S. asylum officers will have larger role in border screenings under new Biden policy - The Washington Post

(Mario Tama/Getty Images)The Biden administration is preparing to implement a new border policy later this spring to ease massive backlogs in U.S. immigration courts by giving U.S. asylum officers a bigger role in screening migrants, officials announced Thursday.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightUnder the new policy, asylum officers at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services will have the authority to grant humanitarian protection to migrants taken into custody along the border. If the officers determine an asylum seeker does not qualify, the case will be forwarded to a U.S. immigration judge, reaching the courts at a more advanced stage in the process, officials said.The goal of the rule change will be to complete asylum cases within months, not years, as has become the norm in a U.S. immigration court system crippled by 1.6 million pending cases.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“The current system for handling asylum claims at our borders has long needed repair,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement. “Through this rule, we are building a more functional and sensible asylum system to ensure that individuals who are eligible will receive protection more swiftly, while those who are not eligible will be rapidly removed.”Biden officials have describe the “asylum officer rule” as one of the administration’s most consequential policy changes at the border. But under the implementation plans officials have described, it appears doubtful the new rule could have a major impact in the coming months when migration levels are high, and climbing higher.U.S. Customs and Border Protection made more than 1.7 million arrests along the Mexico border during the 2021 fiscal year that ended in September, a record. Illegal crossings this year are on pace to exceed that total, and the number of migrants taken into U.S. custody this month is on pace to be the highest since last August, preliminary CBP figures show.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementSince the start of the coronavirus pandemic, U.S. agents have used the Title 42 public health order to rapidly expel or deport most migrants, including asylum seekers. But under normal immigration proceedings, some migrants have avoided deportation or stalled the process by expressing a fear of harm or persecution if returned to their home countries.They are typically able to live and work legally in the United States while their asylum cases are pending, and the slow pace of the process is widely viewed as an incentive to file meritless claims. A 2020 DHS report found 89 percent of the  Central American migrants who arrived as part of a family group between 2014 and 2020 remained in the United States, most with pending immigration cases.Where Trump's border wall left deep scars and open gaps, Biden plans repair jobOfficials declined to say how many asylum officers they have added or how many migrants they expect to be able to screen under the new procedures once the changes take effect in late May or early June.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“There will be a very careful, slow ramp-up of cases into this system,” said a USCIS official who briefed reporters on the condition that the official would not be identified. “We do not anticipate having a large number of individuals placed in this process in the first weeks and months as well make sure the process functions the way we anticipate that it should.”Doris Meissner, director of the U.S. policy program at the Migration Policy Institute in Washington, said the timetables outlined by the administration would be a “significant reform.” The policy outlines an asylum process that would be fully adjudicated in six months or less.“If accomplishing that requires starting with modest numbers of cases, that makes sense from a standpoint of resources and ensuring the process works effectively,” said Meissner, whose 2018 reform recommendations were used by the Biden administration to develop the rule change.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe new policy change will not apply to unaccompanied children or teens who arrive without a parent. It will only apply to individuals the government is seeking to deport using the fast-track process known as expedited removal proceedings.The Biden administration first announced its plans for the policy change last August, triggering a public comment period that drew 5,000 submissions, officials said.Comment CommentsGiftOutlineGift ArticleLoading...Loading...CompanyAbout The PostNewsroom Policies & StandardsDiversity and InclusionCareersMedia & Community RelationsWP Creative GroupAccessibility StatementGet The PostGift SubscriptionsMobile & AppsNewsletters & AlertsWashington Post LiveReprints & PermissionsPost StoreBooks & E-BooksNewspaper in EducationPrint Archives (Subscribers Only)e-ReplicaToday’s PaperContact UsContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareContact the Opinions teamAdvertiseLicensing & SyndicationRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipReport a VulnerabilityTerms of UseDigital Products Terms of SalePrint Products Terms of SaleTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyCookie SettingsSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choiceswashingtonpost.com © 1996-2022 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com© 1996-2022 The Washington PostAbout The PostContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipReport a VulnerabilityDownload the Washington Post AppPolicies & StandardsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyCookie SettingsPrint Products Terms of SaleDigital Products Terms of SaleSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choices",https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/03/24/us-asylum-officers-will-have-larger-role-border-screenings-under-new-biden-policy/,3/24/2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

North Macedonia, which gained independence amid the dissolution of Yugoslavia in 1991, has a population of just over 2 million, considerably less than Rome alone. The Balkan nation will play Portugal on Tuesday with a chance to qualify for the World Cup for the first time.Story continues below advertisementItaly, meanwhile, will spend another four years trying to get back to a tournament in which it has been highly successful. The Azzurri have won the World Cup four times, second only to Brazil (with five) and tied with Germany, and they have twice been runners-up. Before 2018, the last time Italy failed to qualify for the World Cup was 1958.AdvertisementIn between the two recent failures on the world stage, Italy won the 2020 European championship, a triumph that only serves to underscore how improbable Thursday’s result was. In fact, the country had never lost a World Cup qualifying match at home; it entered the day with a 48-0-11 record.Italy was forced into the World Cup qualifying playoff because its 4-0-4 record was only good enough for second place behind Switzerland in its UEFA qualifying group. Italy put pressure on North Macedonia for much of the game, earning 16 corner kicks to zero for the visitors, but could not get anything past goalkeeper Stole Dimitrievski, who made five saves. Italy had 65 percent of the possession and 32 shots to North Macedonia’s four.What you need to read on international soccerThe U.S. men’s national soccer team earned a 0-0 draw against Mexico on Thursday that bolstered its hopes of qualifying for the World Cup in Qatar this November.Brenden Aaronson becomes the latest USMNT player to be struck by injury, bringing the total to five who will be missing for the final round of qualifying.USMNT defender Sergiño Dest, a first-squad player for global power Barcelona, leaves Europa League match early and will miss the final round of World Cup qualifying.Some of the biggest stars of the U.S. women’s national team publicly criticized the U.S. Soccer Federation in the wake of allegations of abuse against male NWSL coaches.Read more soccer news.Comment CommentsGiftOutlineGift ArticleLoading...Loading...CompanyAbout The PostNewsroom Policies & StandardsDiversity and InclusionCareersMedia & Community RelationsWP Creative GroupAccessibility StatementGet The PostGift SubscriptionsMobile & AppsNewsletters & AlertsWashington Post LiveReprints & PermissionsPost StoreBooks & E-BooksNewspaper in EducationPrint Archives (Subscribers Only)e-ReplicaToday’s PaperContact UsContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareContact the Opinions teamAdvertiseLicensing & SyndicationRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipReport a VulnerabilityTerms of UseDigital Products Terms of SalePrint Products Terms of SaleTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyCookie SettingsSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choiceswashingtonpost.com © 1996-2022 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com© 1996-2022 The Washington PostAbout The PostContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipReport a VulnerabilityDownload the Washington Post AppPolicies & StandardsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyCookie SettingsPrint Products Terms of SaleDigital Products Terms of SaleSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choices",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2022/03/24/italy-world-cup/,3/24/2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Joe Manchin III, a Democrat from West Virginia, arrives for a March 3 news conference on Capitol Hill. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) has restarted talks with fellow Democrats about reviving the party’s climate and social spending bill, according to two people familiar with the matter, as administration officials search for oil and gas policies that could make the measure more palatable to him.10 steps you can take to lower your carbon footprintArrowRightManchin, who has traveled in the past week with Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, has told staff members and colleagues that the legislation must be voted on before senators leave town in August, according to the two people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations.Manchin, who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, has said that he wants the bill to take an “all-of-the-above” approach to energy policy, these people said, and that it’s still possible to reach a deal that includes billions of dollars’ worth of provisions to tackle climate change, cut prescription drug costs and update the tax code.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementHe has also indicated that he wants the Biden administration to make some concessions related to oil and gas drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and natural gas exports, they added. The current five-year plan for offshore oil and gas leasing in federal waters expires June 30, and the Interior Department is running behind schedule in drafting a new one, which has frustrated drilling proponents.Without a new five-year plan, the federal government cannot auction off oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico once the current one expires. Administration officials are looking at what policies aimed at boosting domestic energy production they can offer to win over Manchin’s support, according to one of the individuals familiar with these discussions, including possible offshore lease sales that Interior has said can move forward in light of a recent appellate court ruling.A spokeswoman for the Interior Department, Melissa Schwartz, declined to comment.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementManchin spokeswoman Sam Runyon declined to say whether the senator was open to restarting negotiations over the bill, which President Biden had named the Build Back Better Act.“Senator Manchin is always willing to engage in discussions about the best way to move our country forward,” Runyon said in an email. “He has made clear that we can protect energy independence and respond to climate change at the same time.”Manchin’s still-strained relationship with the White House could complicate any negotiations, according to the individuals briefed on the talks. The relationship soured dramatically in late December, when White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain had a hand in drafting an unusually bitter statement excoriating Manchin for coming out publicly against the social spending bill.Here's what Biden is doing to tackle climate changeIt is unclear whether a deal can take shape by the end of July, after which point it will become difficult to move major legislation in advance of the midterm elections. And the Senate’s attention is occupied by the confirmation hearings for Biden’s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementWhite House national climate adviser Gina McCarthy on Thursday said Biden is ready to reengage with Manchin on tax credits and other policies aimed at boosting clean energy and electric vehicles.Biden will “talk to Senator Manchin and anybody else” about the provisions, McCarthy said at an event hosted by the American Council on Renewable Energy, adding, “I am optimistic, but I am not naive. I think we’ll have an ability to move this forward.”Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), one of Congress’s most vocal climate advocates, said in an interview Wednesday that Manchin appears to be onboard with the clean energy tax credits as well as a fee on emissions of methane, a potent planet-warming gas.Story continues below advertisementManchin spent last Friday with Haaland and Granholm as they promoted provisions in the bipartisan infrastructure law in his home state of West Virginia.AdvertisementSen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) — who had tried unsuccessfully to win Manchin’s support for a program shifting power companies away from fossil fuels — said she was encouraged to hear of the “good discussion” on Friday between Manchin and Granholm, who both traveled to Paris this week for the International Energy Agency’s ministerial meeting.“There seems to be the contours for a good agreement, especially on the clean energy tax credits,” Smith said in an interview Wednesday.Manchin on Friday praised the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for reconsidering a policy launched last month to evaluate how pipelines and other natural gas projects affect climate change, and its approval of three new pipeline projects.Story continues below advertisement“Energy security for America and our allies is dependent on FERC’s ability to move much needed energy infrastructure projects forward,” he said in a statement. “To do so they must maintain clear and predictable policies that strike the right balance between energy security, affordability and environmental considerations.”AdvertisementBiden administration and European officials also announced a new partnership Friday to redirect gas exports to Europe, part of a broader push to reduce Europe’s dependence on Russian energy amid the war in Ukraine. Under the agreement, the United States will work with other nations to increase liquefied natural gas exports to Europe by at least 15 billion cubic meters this year, with the aim of providing larger shipments in the future.Pager reported from Brussels.Sign up for the latest news about climate change, energy and the environment, delivered every ThursdayMore on climate changeLearn more: How we know global warming is real | Postcards from Earth’s climate futures | The undeniable link between weather disasters and climate change | How climate change is making parts of the world too hot and humid to surviveTips: How to cope with your anxiety about climate change | Thinking of buying an electric vehicle?

But Alexander said she was uneasy about the procedures in place. (AJ Mast for The Washington Post)The drive-through coronavirus testing site, a metal shipping container in the parking lot of an Indianapolis shopping mall, gave Bridgette Alexander pause.The man administering tests at the site, run by a company called O’Hare Clinical Lab Services, was wearing jeans and a leather jacket, not medical scrubs or a gown. He moved among the cars without changing gloves, she said. He asked for her driver’s license but not her insurance card.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightBut Alexander was feeling ill and desperate to make sure she didn’t pass covid-19 to her husband, a kidney transplant recipient. The rapid test came back negative that day, Dec. 23, providing temporary relief, she said.Story continues below advertisementFive days later, still sick, she went to a hospital. The test there came back positive. Her husband soon fell ill, too. He was hospitalized with covid-19 in mid-January and has remained on a ventilator since then, Alexander said.AdvertisementWhile false negatives occur on antigen tests, Alexander now believes the first test was wholly unreliable. “I felt like the O’Hare results affected me. If I had been given real results, I could have been more cautious,” she said. “I could have done more.”Once a small lab based out of a suburban strip mall that provided clinical tests for nursing homes and assisted-living centers near Chicago, O’Hare morphed into a testing juggernaut during the pandemic, setting up more than 100 pop-up coronavirus testing sites across the country, some little more than the shipping containers, records show.Story continues below advertisementIn just 15 months, the company collected $187 million in federal money, according to government records, as it shifted its business focus and emerged as one of the nation’s largest test providers through a new program that reimbursed providers for the costs of testing the uninsured.AdvertisementLast month, federal regulators suspended O’Hare’s license to operate a lab and cut off federal payments, previously unreported documents obtained by The Washington Post show. The sanction capped a string of safety concerns that date to the lab’s foray into coronavirus testing in late 2020 and, in some cases, allegedly put people at risk of serious injury or death, according to interviews and an examination of records by The Post.O’Hare’s rise illustrates the shortcomings of the federal government’s approach to coronavirus testing and provides a portrait of a freewheeling segment of the testing industry that ballooned during the pandemic amid a massive infusion of government money.Story continues below advertisementAbsent a robust public health testing infrastructure, the federal government directed billions of dollars to private health companies to provide coronavirus testing for the uninsured, creating lucrative opportunities for large, established firms as well as more obscure companies with spotty safety records.AdvertisementThe lab director who was responsible for attesting to O’Hare’s safety procedures and worked for O’Hare during most of the pandemic told The Post that she resigned because she had been kept in the dark about the company’s network of pop-up locations. Two other former employees said in interviews that they did not do the jobs attributed to them on documents O’Hare submitted to health regulators last year that listed the lab’s key safety personnel and their roles.In addition to collecting samples that were sent back to O’Hare’s lab in Chicago for PCR testing, the remote sites offered free rapid antigen tests, tests that were not authorized under O’Hare’s license, records show. Patients complained repeatedly to attorneys general in multiple states that they never got their testing results from O’Hare, documents show.One remote site in Wisconsin had no electricity or running water and only a kerosene generator for warmth despite the need to keep rapid tests at room temperature, a federal inspection shows. A federal inspection at the main O’Hare site in Chicago in December 2020 found lab workers moved back and forth between the lab and an adjacent open kitchen for breaks in their protective gear.State health inspectors in Indiana witnessed “deficiencies in the performance of testing” at the site Alexander visited and one other, according to federal inspectors who cited the state findings — without greater detail — in a more extensive report explaining why reimbursements were stopped until O’Hare could demonstrate it had a credible plan to improve.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“O’Hare Clinical Lab made some mistakes due to the extensive and sudden demand for its services during the pandemic,” Stephen Lee, an attorney for O’Hare, said in an emailed statement in response to The Post’s findings. “O’Hare Clinical Lab has been working to address the issues raised by regulators in late 2021. O’Hare has suspended all testing until it resolves all regulatory issues.”The lab did not address most of the detailed questions posed by The Post.In a statement for this story, the federal agency that regulates clinical labs, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, cited its sanctions against O’Hare in February that halted further payments to the lab and suspended its license.Story continues below advertisement“Throughout the pandemic, CMS has taken swift and aggressive action to identify and investigate fraud and support law enforcement agencies,” the statement said. The agency is “committed to preventing fraud and protecting people with Medicare from falling victim to scams.”AdvertisementThe Post review is based on lab inspection reports and license applications, court documents, state incorporation records, consumer complaints filed in multiple states, and interviews with patients and the three former O’Hare employees.O’Hare ranked eighth among more than 30,000 companies that have been reimbursed a total of $11.3 billion for providing testing to the uninsured, according to a government database. Most of the other top 10 companies are well-established, publicly traded commercial labs, such as Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp.Story continues below advertisementBut O’Hare’s work is not alone in drawing attention from regulators and other authorities.The FBI has executed search warrants at the locations of two other Chicago coronavirus testing companies that also set up pop-up sites and collected tens of millions of dollars for carrying out coronavirus testing of the uninsured, searches reported by USA Today and Block Club Chicago. The FBI declined to comment on any investigations into the labs. The two labs, Doctors Clinical Laboratory and LabElite, also rank among the nation’s top 25 government-funded providers of testing for the uninsured, having collected $152 million and $77 million under the program, respectively.AdvertisementThe scrutiny of the testing companies comes as the Biden administration announced in early March that the Justice Department would appoint a chief prosecutor and create a task force to investigate fraud in the government’s pandemic spending.Story continues below advertisementO’Hare’s expansion into coronavirus testing was overseen by Mohamed Siraj, who took over management of the lab in September 2020 and now owns it, according to documents and interviews.In recent years, Siraj, 49, has managed companies focused on real estate investment, website design and laundry service, as well as storefront medical clinics and a same-day surgical center, according to court and state incorporation records.Siraj in a brief phone call declined an interview and referred a Post reporter to an attorney, who in turn directed the request to a public relations firm. Siraj did not respond to another request to talk left at his office or to an interview request sought among a list of questions posed to the company.O’Hare’s beginningsO’Hare started modestly.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementLaunched in 2006, its clients were mostly nursing homes and assisted-living centers in the Chicago area, and it never generated more than $2 million in annual revenue over the following decade, according to Frank Perez, one of two founders. Perez, 55, stepped down as co-owner in 2016, and the other founder, Mohd Emad Jaber, took over sole ownership of the lab, Perez said. Jaber declined to comment through an attorney, Josh Herman.O’Hare told regulators last year that Jaber, 64, had a master’s degree in clinical lab sciences and 40 years of experience.As far back as 2015, regulators found lapses at the lab, according to interviews and documents obtained from the Illinois Department of Public Health through public records requests.That year, O’Hare was temporarily ordered to stop cholesterol testing after it failed multiple examinations of its testing procedures, according to a government-approved lab accreditation organization called COLA. In an interview, Perez described the failure as a minor error by a lab worker and said the issue was resolved. O’Hare passed examinations the following year, according to COLA.AdvertisementIn 2019, an inspector for CMS found the lab was not properly documenting storage requirements and expiration dates for lab materials and was violating regulations that require written procedures for handling patient specimens. The lab accepted the findings and said it would fix the labeling problem and update its policies, according to the federal inspection report.The following year, O’Hare moved to its current location on the far West Side of Chicago, on the third floor of a brick office building that it shares with a charter high school. The move coincided with Siraj’s involvement in the lab. O’Hare signed an agreement in September 2020 that made one of Siraj’s companies, Chicago Polyclinic, the management firm of the lab with responsibility for O’Hare’s operations, marketing and accounting, according to a letter provided by a spokesman for O’Hare. O’Hare declined to answer questions about exactly when the move and the new ownership occurred.Siraj also helped finance O’Hare during the pandemic and would later manage its pop-up testing sites, O’Hare’s attorney, Lee, said in the emailed statement.Chicago Polyclinic, launched in May 2020, is set among appliance and electronics shops and restaurants on the far North Side of Chicago. The clinic’s storefront advertises services for pain management and laser hair removal, as well as chiropractic services. It also advertises medical treatment after auto accidents and work injuries and promises “top settlement guaranteed.”By December 2020, with the pandemic raging, O’Hare began performing only coronavirus testing, according to CMS records. It also began submitting claims to the federal government for testing the uninsured, according to a spokesman for the federal Health Resources and Services Administration.Collecting payments from the government was relatively easy: Health-care providers entered a patient’s name into an electronic portal, along with other information, and attested that the patient did not have insurance. The payment to the provider would be made by direct deposit within 30 days, according to the HRSA website. The government reimbursed $100 per PCR test, according to the HRSA website. O’Hare’s lawyer said in a statement that the lab did not bill the government for rapid tests it performed at its remote sites.The same month that O’Hare began receiving payments, a federal inspector visited its lab, documents show.Touring on Dec. 30, 2020, the inspector found glaring safety violations: Specimens were tested in an area beside the open kitchen, which workers passed through without removing their gloves, masks or lab coats, according to the report.The lab had already done 15,000 coronavirus tests at that point but still had not run its procedures through the verification process required to show its tests yielded accurate results, the inspector found.Additionally, O’Hare was not reporting test results to public health officials as it was supposed to, according to the report. O’Hare lab workers explained to the inspector that they regularly gave the test results to the company’s accountant, who worked at a separate location, and they said they believed he was manually faxing the results to Illinois health officials.The inspector also found that the lab director, who was not named in the report, was unqualified to run a “high-complexity laboratory.” The lab lacked other highly trained personnel required under federal regulations, too. And there were not enough qualified lab workers to perform either the volume or complexity of coronavirus tests they were doing, according to the inspection.At the time, O’Hare was advertising seven walk-in sites for coronavirus testing — all in the Chicago area — according to an archived version of the lab’s website.Problems and promisesO’Hare quickly tried to address the problems, according to documents it provided to regulators, including by bringing Smaranda Badescu aboard as the new lab director in January 2021.A doctor and microbiologist, Badescu, 82, was in retirement but maintained the credentials and board certification to run a high-complexity lab. A native of Romania, she came to the United States when she was 50 and had worked as director of another Chicago lab, she said in a brief interview outside her home in February.She told The Post that O’Hare “was a mess” before she came on and that Jaber, one of the lab’s founders, hired her to help set it right. “They were desperate,” she said.She said she agreed to the job with conditions: She would mostly work remotely because she no longer felt comfortable driving on the highway, and she needed to care for her ill husband, she said. She estimated she visited the lab three times in person in total during her year with O’Hare. Badescu worked with regulators to get the lab in compliance, documents show.The new lab director “solved and corrected many problems,” O’Hare wrote in a response to regulators on March 30 of last year, documents show.O’Hare also told regulators that the lab had hired other qualified scientists and medical personnel, submitting a roster of employees and their credentials to the Illinois Department of Public Health. The roster, dated March 31, listed nine lab employees in all.When contacted by a reporter, two of the people on the roster said that they had done little or no work for the lab.Abdel Abdelhadi, identified as O’Hare’s quality assurance and regulatory officer, said through his lawyer that he never agreed to take on that role.“Mr. Abdelhadi acted as an outside consultant to O’Hare Clinical Lab Services in a limited capacity in 2021,” attorney Eric Pruitt wrote. “He never served as O’Hare’s Quality Assurance and Regulatory Officer, nor did he serve in any other oversight or supervisory role within the lab. Any document or communication with regulatory authorities suggesting otherwise is incorrect and was made without Mr. Abdelhadi’s knowledge or authorization.”Javed Nazir, a doctor of internal medicine in a Chicago suburb, is listed on the roster as the lab’s clinical consultant, a position that is required under federal regulations.“I am on paper, but I don’t do anything for them,” he said when reached by phone in February, before hanging up. He declined to comment when a reporter later visited his office in La Grange, about 15 miles southwest of Chicago.O’Hare also told federal regulators in January 2021 that it was performing only PCR tests and that it was analyzing specimens in only one location: its lab in Chicago. It repeated those claims in a document to regulators in March.Pop-up sites proliferateAt the same time, O’Hare was taking steps to open new pop-up sites, according to court records.Under a Jan. 26, 2021, agreement, O’Hare promised to pay a newly formed company called Express Covid Tests to set up more collection sites, according to a contract in a lawsuit Express filed in Illinois state circuit court.O’Hare would pay $35 for each sample collected at the sites for PCR testing, as long as they numbered a least 5,000 a month, according to a copy of the contract — signed by Siraj for O’Hare — that was filed with the lawsuit. The contract provides that O’Hare would then seek reimbursement from the federal government or from insurance companies. It does not specify where the sites would be.In its lawsuit, Express alleged that O’Hare owed it $241,000. The lawsuit, filed in December, is still in its early stages. O’Hare has not yet filed a response in court. Both O’Hare and Express declined to comment on the lawsuit.In addition to collecting samples to send back to the lab in Chicago for PCR testing, the pop-up sites also offered free rapid antigen tests at each location, tests that were not authorized under O’Hare’s license.Lee, the company’s attorney, acknowledged the error in the statement to The Post. “O’Hare’s management company mistakenly assumed in 2021 that antigen tests could be performed at collection sites,” he wrote.Badescu said she was unaware of the more than 100 remote sites and therefore never developed safety procedures for them or training for site workers. Badescu said she also became increasingly busy with caring for her husband, whose condition worsened before he died of covid in December.She said that at one point last year she asked Jaber where the PCR samples arriving at the lab were coming from. Jaber, who was still working as general supervisor of the lab, responded, “ ‘You shouldn’t worry, the management is taking care of it,’ ” Badescu recalls. O’Hare’s attorney said Jaber is no longer an employee or owner of the lab and that Siraj now owns O’Hare.Siraj wrote a letter to Badescu on Nov. 24, 2021, saying he took “full responsibility for rolling out the antigen testing” without getting formal approval from O’Hare for expanding the rapid testing. O’Hare provided The Post a copy of the letter.By late last year, O’Hare advertised testing collection sites beyond Illinois, in Kentucky, Louisiana, Florida, Wisconsin, Indiana, Minnesota, Massachusetts, California and Tennessee, according to an archived version of its website.Some of the remote locations were set up without required permits from local authorities, according to the local officials. In Florida’s Miami-Dade County, for example, O’Hare advertised five testing sites. Each would have required a business permit from the county, said county spokeswoman Natalia Jaramillo. She said there were none on record. The company did not address The Post’s questions about approvals from local authorities.As O’Hare extended its reach, samples for PCR testing were flooding into the Chicago lab.O’Hare had told federal regulators it expected to perform 180,000 covid-19 PCR tests during all of 2021, according to a document it submitted in January 2021. But it would administer vastly more — some 284,000 tests in November and December 2021 alone — according to data the company provided to The Post.A pivotal inspectionAmong the O’Hare sites was a shipping container placed in the parking lot of an outlet mall in Pleasant Prairie, Wis., a village just south of Milwaukee in Kenosha County.The county’s public health director, Jen Freiheit, told The Post she recalled getting a phone call from a representative of O’Hare last fall alerting her that the testing site was coming online. Testing options were limited at the time, so Freiheit said she was enthusiastic.“They sounded legit,” she said about the O’Hare representative.In late October, Kenosha County listed the O’Hare location on its website as a recommended testing option for both rapid and PCR tests. But soon after, Freiheit and other officials began getting complaints about the O’Hare site, including reports of collection workers not wearing protective equipment and patients not getting their results, she said.She forwarded the complaints to state health officials and the county removed the location from its website, she said.On the afternoon of Nov. 3, a CMS inspector visited the Pleasant Prairie site in response to a complaint. The inspector found a 10-foot-by-10-foot metal pod with a sign advertising “Free Covid testing.”Inside, workers were performing rapid antigen tests that are supposed to be kept at room temperature to work properly. But it was in the low 40s outdoors, and the pod had only a small kerosene heater that emitted little heat, according to the report. It also lacked electricity, running water and a refrigerator.The workers had collected 65 patient samples to send back to Chicago for PCR testing. None were labeled with patient information, as required, leading the inspector to conclude that the lab “failed to ensure positive identification and optimum integrity of a patient’s specimen from the time of collection through completion of testing and reporting of results.”A week later the inspector went to O’Hare’s Chicago lab to investigate further. Asked for documentation showing that the workers at 50 collection sites advertised on its website had been properly trained, O’Hare produced records for only 15, the report shows.The inspector also found that the samples tested by O’Hare were first sent to Siraj’s Chicago Polyclinic. Chicago Polyclinic did business under the name Devon Polyclinic, according to state corporation records. Devon performed tasks related to tracking and labeling O’Hare’s samples but was not authorized to do so, the inspector wrote.The inspection, previously reported by Block Club Chicago, found the O’Hare lab had put patients in “immediate jeopardy.”In response, O’Hare sent a letter on Nov. 24 to all the operators of its pop-up sites telling them to stop performing rapid antigen tests, according to CMS documents. But the Indianapolis site Alexander and her 17-year-old daughter Mariah went to in December was still offering those tests, and testing continued into mid-January, when the Indiana state inspectors were at the location and found “deficiencies in the performance of testing,"" federal records show.By late last year, more than 45 complaints about O’Hare had poured in to state attorneys general in Florida, Illinois, Missouri and Kentucky, most from people who said they never received their results, according to records reviewed by The Post.Mike Bass of Louisville was feeling rundown and achy when he scoured for a testing site in late December and was drawn to O’Hare’s advertising free, fast results and walk-ins. He has never received a record of his test results, he said.After standing in line for about an hour with about 15 people, Bass said he had a rapid test from the lone employee who handled everything from passing out clipboards to swabbing noses and packing samples. He said he was told verbally he was negative.But the 50-year-old began doubting the outcome as his symptoms persisted and took another rapid test the next day at a drugstore. That test showed he was positive, as did a PCR test at a university, Bass said.Thinking about the plumbers and other contractors he had seen waiting at O’Hare, he said, “all these guys who were probably testing ‘negative’ that day, and going back to work,” Bass said. “Doing electrical work in someone’s house, or working at a bar, thinking that they’re fine.”O’Hare declined to comment on individual cases.O’Hare’s lab certification on the lineIn January, after the Wisconsin inspection and the follow-up visit to O’Hare’s Chicago lab, O’Hare struggled to prove to regulators that it had addressed testing problems, CMS documents show.Twice that month, O’Hare asked for extensions — that CMS granted — to make its case for why it should not be sanctioned.When the company submitted paperwork, CMS found the explanations were “not credible” and stated that O’Hare still had not provided key information about its operation, including a list of all of its collection sites, a Feb. 10 letter to O’Hare obtained by The Post shows.The letter also notified O’Hare that CMS was suspending O’Hare’s license and barring it from receiving Medicare or Medicaid money for any lab services.Additionally, the CMS letter said, regulators had visited two O’Hare collection sites in Indiana in January and found still more violations.The letter said O’Hare’s certificate to operate a lab would be revoked on April 11, unless the company appealed and persuaded the agency to reverse its decision at a hearing.Badescu said she learned about the pop-up sites from the inspection report out of Wisconsin. She resigned from the lab in January and said she filed a complaint with a law enforcement agency but declined to identify the agency or elaborate on what her complaint contained.In retrospect, she said, she feels the lab hired her believing she would not raise red flags.“I think in their mind, they thought, she is female, she’s 82, she won’t see,” she said.She said she was not involved in the lab’s billing or financial side and was surprised the lab had received $187 million from the federal government.“I don’t understand how,” she said. “It’s absolutely unbelievable.”Alice Crites contributed to this report.Coronavirus: What you need to readThe latest: A surge in infections in Western Europe, fueled by the subvariant of omicron known as BA.2, has experts and health authorities on alert for another wave of the pandemic in the United States.

New York is one of the cities with sharp losses. (Mark Lennihan/Associated Press)correctionThe headline accompanying a previous version of this article incorrectly stated that most U.S. counties lost population in 2020. Most counties reported more deaths than births. The article has been corrected.Almost three-fourths of all U.S. counties reported more deaths than births last year, a development largely caused by the pandemic, which contributed to a dramatic slowing in the overall population growth of the nation, according to data released Thursday by the Census Bureau.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightLow fertility rates, which have persisted since the end of the Great Recession, and the continuing demographic shift toward an older population also combined to create the smallest population increase in 100 years, said Kenneth Johnson, a sociology professor and demographer at the University of New Hampshire.Johnson said he expected the data to show a natural decrease but was surprised at its scale. Natural decrease occurs when a population records more deaths than births. “I think one of the most important findings is the fact that almost 2,300 counties had more deaths than births in them. That’s unheard of in American history,” he said.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementHe said the impact of the coronavirus, along with other trends that limited population growth, had created a “perfect storm,” and that one would have to go back at least to the 1918 flu pandemic to find anything like it.
The data also offered statistical backing to widespread anecdotal evidence suggesting that millions of Americans moved out of the largest cities in the nation, including the District, during the pandemic.Whether for safety from infectious disease or convenience during shutdowns, millions of residents traded cities for suburbs or larger suburbs for smaller ones. Many migrated farther into rural counties or resettled to second homes in vacation areas, such as the Catskill Mountains or the Delmarva Peninsula.Story continues below advertisementThe two largest cities in the nation, Los Angeles and New York, suffered the sharpest losses as a result of internal migration. Los Angeles County lost over 179,750 people in net domestic migration, while New York County lost over 113,640.AdvertisementCalifornia, Oregon and Mississippi had the most counties negatively affected by international migration losses, while Alaska, Louisiana and Illinois had the most counties affected by losses caused by domestic migration within the United States.Of course, the outflows from some states meant gains in others. Maricopa County in Arizona, which includes Phoenix, received the most people, with more than 46,860 flowing in, from other areas of the United States.Story continues below advertisement“I’m very surprised by this because I didn’t think it was going to be as dramatic, the domestic migration piece of it,” said William Frey, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, who analyzed the data and its impact on the Washington region. “It may be a blip, and I think it is, but it’s certainly noteworthy. I think that’s the bigger demographic pattern here.”Census finds Black population grows in suburbs and shrinks in citiesFrey said that although outward domestic migration from these and other major cities had been underway for many years, its effect had been masked by increases in foreign immigrants, but those numbers also slowed during the pandemic.AdvertisementThe data released Thursday covered roughly 3,140 counties, more than 380 metropolitan statistical areas and over 540 smaller locales known as micropolitan statistical areas. The period covered by the data, July 2020 to July 2021, also coincided with some of the peak rates of the spread of the coronavirus, as reflected in reported cases.Story continues below advertisementIn that time, nearly 75 percent of all U.S. counties experienced a natural population decrease, compared with 55 percent of all counties in 2020 and 45 percent in 2019, the Census Bureau found. In Maine, Delaware, Rhode Island and New Hampshire, the natural population decrease occurred in every county.The District recorded a loss of 20,040 people, driven mostly by domestic migration, while the Washington metropolitan area lost more than 29,000 people, Frey said. Montgomery County experienced a loss of more than 6,410 people, Prince George’s County reported a decline of nearly 10,300, and Fairfax County’s population declined by over 8,750. Prince William County added more than 1,730 people, Frey found.He also noted the huge turnaround in immigration, tracing a peak influx of more than 47,000 reported in July 2015 to only 12,600 last year.More on the censusHere’s how America’s racial makeup has changed over the past decade. You can drill down by address to see how certain areas have shifted.In the latest release, data showed that the number of White people in the United States fell for the first time since 1790. The White population also decreased in D.C.Population growth across the United States was also at the second-slowest pace in history, and the “places to be” have also shifted. Meanwhile, America’s developed areas are growing.Population changes also dictate a change in politics. Here’s a breakdown of which states gained and lost electoral votes and clout in Congress.Historically, the census has never been delayed. But there have been past fears of an inaccurate count, and results have been used to target minorities.Comment CommentsGiftOutlineGift ArticleLoading...Loading...CompanyAbout The PostNewsroom Policies & StandardsDiversity and InclusionCareersMedia & Community RelationsWP Creative GroupAccessibility StatementGet The PostGift SubscriptionsMobile & AppsNewsletters & AlertsWashington Post LiveReprints & PermissionsPost StoreBooks & E-BooksNewspaper in EducationPrint Archives (Subscribers Only)e-ReplicaToday’s PaperContact UsContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareContact the Opinions teamAdvertiseLicensing & SyndicationRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipReport a VulnerabilityTerms of UseDigital Products Terms of SalePrint Products Terms of SaleTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyCookie SettingsSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choiceswashingtonpost.com © 1996-2022 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com© 1996-2022 The Washington PostAbout The PostContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipReport a VulnerabilityDownload the Washington Post AppPolicies & StandardsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyCookie SettingsPrint Products Terms of SaleDigital Products Terms of SaleSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choices",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/03/24/census-population-counties-cities-covid/,3/24/2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Andrew Harnik/AP)The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection is set to vote next week on whether to hold two aides to former president Donald Trump in criminal contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with the committee’s subpoenas.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightThe committee will meet Monday to consider a report recommending holding two former Trump White House officials — former trade and manufacturing director Peter Navarro and former communications chief Daniel Scavino Jr. — for criminal contempt of Congress. If the committee approves the matter, the House would vote on whether to refer Navarro and Scavino to the Justice Department for prosecution.The bipartisan Jan. 6 panel is investigating the 2021 storming of the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob that tried to stop the confirmation of Joe Biden’s electoral college win, an attack that led to five deaths and left some 140 members of law enforcement injured.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe committee subpoenaed Scavino, along with several other former Trump advisers, last September, but an attorney for Trump instructed the group not to comply with congressional investigators. Trump’s legal team tried to argue that the former aides were protected by executive and other privileges, but President Biden rejected the executive privilege claims last month.Scavino could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday.Last month, the committee subpoenaed Navarro, who has written and publicly discussed the effort to develop a strategy to delay or overturn certification of the 2020 election. In a statement to Politico Thursday, Navarro called the committee’s impending contempt vote “an unprecedented partisan assault on executive privilege” and continued claiming executive privilege.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“Until this matter has been settled at the Supreme Court, where it is inevitably headed, the Committee should cease its tactic of harassment and intimidation,” Navarro told Politico. “I would be happy to cooperate with the committee in expediting a review of this matter by the Supreme Court and look forward to arguing the case.”Scavino and Navarro are among the latest in high-profile Trump White House officials facing repercussions for refusing to comply with the Jan. 6 committee’s subpoenas. Last year, former Trump adviser Stephen K. Bannon was indicted on charges of contempt of Congress, which prompted warnings from some Republicans of “payback” that they could do the same to Democrats if they retake control of the House majority in November.Mark Meadows, a former chief of staff in the Trump White House, also refused to cooperate with the committee, leading to the House voting to hold him in contempt of Congress as well in December.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe Jan. 6 committee’s legal battles in its effort to subpoena records that would help committee members investigate the insurrection have not been limited to individuals. Earlier this month, the Republican National Committee filed a lawsuit against the Jan. 6 committee seeking to block the panel’s subpoena of data from Salesforce, an RNC software vendor.In its subpoena of Salesforce, the Jan. 6 committee said it needed performance metrics and analytics related to Trump’s campaign to investigate if Trump and the RNC used the software vendor’s platform to disseminate false statements about the 2020 election, citing evidence that many rioters were motivated by those false claims. The RNC’s lawsuit argued that the request went beyond the scope of the congressional committee’s subpoena power.Comment CommentsGiftOutlineGift ArticleLoading...Loading...CompanyAbout The PostNewsroom Policies & StandardsDiversity and InclusionCareersMedia & Community RelationsWP Creative GroupAccessibility StatementGet The PostGift SubscriptionsMobile & AppsNewsletters & AlertsWashington Post LiveReprints & PermissionsPost StoreBooks & E-BooksNewspaper in EducationPrint Archives (Subscribers Only)e-ReplicaToday’s PaperContact UsContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareContact the Opinions teamAdvertiseLicensing & SyndicationRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipReport a VulnerabilityTerms of UseDigital Products Terms of SalePrint Products Terms of SaleTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyCookie SettingsSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choiceswashingtonpost.com © 1996-2022 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com© 1996-2022 The Washington PostAbout The PostContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipReport a VulnerabilityDownload the Washington Post AppPolicies & StandardsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyCookie SettingsPrint Products Terms of SaleDigital Products Terms of SaleSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choices",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/24/jan-6-committee-trump-navarro-scavino-contempt-congress/,3/24/2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Mauricio Duenas Castaneda/EPE-EFE/Shutterstock)MEDELLÍN, Colombia — Even before the pandemic, Jimy Alejandro Carmona was going hungry.Having left school after the sixth grade, the young man found occasional work cleaning up trash on the streets of his neighborhood overlooking Colombia’s second-biggest city. But it was barely enough to feed his mother, his sister and himself and pay their $117 rent. Some days — many days, during the peak of the country’s coronavirus crisis — they hardly ate anything.Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine.ArrowRightHis desperation led him to join the thousands of Colombians last year who protested a government they said had made life even harder for the poor in one of the most unequal countries in the world. That desperation had now led him to a metro station in Medellín to hand out campaign newspapers for a man he says could lift him out of hopelessness: Gustavo Petro, a former guerrilla member-turned-politician who has his best chance yet of becoming the first leftist president in Colombia’s history.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAt the very least, Carmona would make $9 a day in the process.As Colombians prepare to vote in the presidential election in May, scores of young, struggling people are backing Petro, a former mayor of Bogotá and third-time presidential candidate. The 61-year-old senator, who was a member of the 19th of April Movement, or M-19, in the 1980s, gained more than twice as many votes in this month’s primary elections as the leader of the right-wing coalition and six times as many as the leading centrist candidate.Governments are shifting to the left across Latin America, a region hit hard by the pandemic’s economic assault, where widening inequality is fueling discontent. Chile this month swore in 36-year-old former student activist Gabriel Boric as president, following wins by leftist candidates in Bolivia, Peru and Honduras. Former Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is the favorite to win the October election in Latin America’s largest country.Petro told The Washington Post he envisions a progressive “axis” between Chile, Colombia and Brazil. He said he aims to usher in a new Latin American left, built not on extracting natural resources like governments past but on protecting the environment and advancing industrialization.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“We will propose to Latin America a new path,” Petro said.Chile’s millennial president-elect is a sign of a very different ‘pink tide’That path, if Petro were to win, would include ending new oil exploration to move the country toward renewable energy. It would mean boosting the local agriculture industry by renegotiating trade agreements with the United States. It would mean taxing the 4,000 wealthiest Colombians. On Wednesday, he announced that Francia Márquez, an Afro Colombian human rights and environmental activist, would be his running mate.In a country that has never been led by a true leftist, Petro’s lead in the polls is generating panic elsewhere on the political spectrum. A phenomenon known as the “Petro clause” has appeared in contracts, stating they’ll take effect only if he loses.Story continues below advertisementPetro has been careful to distance himself from the socialist governments of Cuba and Venezuela, but conservatives fear the relationships he might build with their leaders. He told The Post that better relations with the government of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro would help the countries revive trade and regain control of a border taken over by drug trafficking groups.In the May vote, he’ll probably face the most opposition here, in the traditionally conservative department of Antioquia, the cradle of the country’s right-wing parties and the birthplace of former president Álvaro Uribe, one of the country’s most powerful and polarizing politicians. The two key candidates competing against Petro are both former mayors of Medellín: the conservative Federico Gutiérrez, 47, and the centrist Sergio Fajardo, 65. Petro won twice as many primary votes as Fajardo in his own department, but Gutiérrez was the clear winner in Antioquia, bringing in three times as many votes as Petro.Still, Petro’s young campaign volunteers here are convinced the city is changing. Four years ago, the second time Petro ran for president, he hardly campaigned in Antioquia. This time, his rallies have packed public plazas across the department.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementCarmona, at the metro station, wrapped the Colombian flag around his back as he handed a woman a campaign newspaper with Petro’s face on the cover.“If Antioquia changes,” the headline read, “Colombia changes.”Changing the systemEach time Petro has run for president, his candidacy has galvanized an opposition fearful he’d turn Colombia into Venezuela. But the prospect of “Castro-Chavismo” is no longer as powerful a boogeyman for Colombians, Sergio Guzmán said.“People are so fed up with the status quo that becoming Venezuela is not what frightens them the most,” said Guzmán, director of the consulting firm Colombia Risk Analysis. “What frightens them the most is staying the way we are.”Story continues below advertisementFor the first time in nearly two decades, Uribe is no longer seen as strong enough to sway an election. The security hard-liner is celebrated for his hardhanded approach against armed rebel groups and despised for presiding over repeated alleged human rights violations. But he is now best-known for handpicking the deeply unpopular current president, Iván Duque, who critics say has done little to improve the country’s security or economic well-being.Bloody fighting between guerrilla groups is terrorizing Colombian border communitiesAbout 1.6 million Colombians fell out of the middle class during the pandemic. Violence in many parts of the country has increased, as have the killings of social leaders and environmental activists. Frustration over a proposed tax revision and broader discontent over inequality fueled months of protests last year. In a recent Ipsos survey, 84 percent of Colombians said their country was moving in the wrong direction, the second-highest rate among 28 countries surveyed.Petro’s crowd-rousing speeches have often focused on what he says many of these problems come down to: hunger.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“Decreasing hunger requires change, change to an economic system that has reached its end,” Petro told a large crowd in Medellín this month. “Change to a social system that has produced a society that is profoundly unjust.”What would it take to change the system? The primaries brought big wins for Petro’s leftist coalition in Congress, but not enough to win a majority. Petro would have to work with a divided legislature to pass his agenda. But he’s already announced he would declare an economic state of emergency to combat hunger if elected, a proposal criticized by some constitutional law experts.“This proposal is part of a tendency of a certain Latin American left that the only way to make profound social changes is through a strong president who does not agree or seek consensus with political forces through Congress, but uses mechanisms of executive orders instead,” said law professor Rodrigo Uprimny, who sat temporarily on the country’s constitutional court.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementSome U.S. critics worry a Petro presidency would strain relations with Washington. The candidate has suggested changing the extradition treaty between the two countries. A former U.S. official in Colombia said a Petro victory could complicate the long-running partnership in combating drug trafficking.Petro argues that counterdrug policies over the last several decades have been a failure and that aerial eradication of coca has done nothing to reduce the flow of cocaine to the United States. He would focus instead on crop substitution.“The main concern is whether he’s committed to work within the system to promote change,” said Michael Shifter, president of the D.C.-based Inter-American Dialogue, “or whether he’s willing to destroy the system.”Story continues below advertisementIf no candidate wins a majority in May, the two top will go to a runoff in June. Petro and his rivals have alleged voting fraud in the country’s electoral system. On Monday, Petro announced he would no longer participate in debates until “voting transparency” is guaranteed.AdvertisementResistance buildsCarmona was agitated as he arrived at the metro station. He had been passing out Petro’s newspapers on a street nearby, he said, when a police officer called him a “guerrilla fighter.”Fellow campaign worker Valentina Álvarez saw just how much opposition Petro would have to overcome to win over Medellín voters. She’d been insulted, sworn at, approached by a man who yelled in her ear: “I’m not voting for him.”A man to whom she tried to pass a newspaper made the sign of the cross and kept walking. One woman said, “I’ll take one because it’s your job” and then tossed it in the trash.Across Medellín and Colombia, an anti-Petro resistance is once again gaining force. Conservative politicians and the traditional establishment are rallying behind Gutiérrez. Several civic groups in Antioquia have organized “to help citizens understand the importance of Colombia’s economic model,” according to a Medellín business executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss political matters.Advertisement“If Petro comes to power, he’s going to install communism in the country,” the executive said.Petro called such claims “unfounded.”“It’s logical, because Colombia has had such a democratic deficit that only a few families have governed for two centuries,” he said. “When the possibility arises that this history will change … it scares them because they see it as abnormal, when it should be normal in any democratic country on earth.”He added: “Any entrepreneur should not be afraid of a government program that seeks to increase national production.”Ingrid Betancourt, held by FARC rebels for more than six years, announces run for Colombia presidentGutiérrez has frequently criticized Petro’s “populist projects.” He recently blasted a Petro proposal to use pensions to fund social programs, calling it “dangerous.”“He wants to spend money that does not belong to him and wants to expropriate it, just as he wants to do with lands and private property,” Gutiérrez said. Petro has denied the accusation.AdvertisementPetro has begun creating alliances with people who might seem counterintuitive, such as a Christian leader with thousands of followers on the Caribbean coast. But he’s drawn criticism from liberals for ties to a conservative former Medellín mayor and a local politician accused of domestic violence.Aides from his time as mayor of Bogotá have accused him of refusing to listen to advisers and displaying authoritarian tendencies.“The way he does politics, his alliances, his decisions, not opposing gender-based violence … those types of things lose him points,” said Sara Tufano, a feminist and sociologist who once campaigned for him. “He’s not an easy person to work with. He’s not a conciliatory person.”Petro called such criticism “fake news.”Carmona has a tattoo on his right arm of a crown. Below it is the name “Sandra,” his mother.The day before, he said, “she didn’t have a bite to eat all day long.” He wept.“We’re tired of being robbed. We’re tired of putting up with hunger. We’re tired of walking around looking for jobs and not finding any,” Carmona said. “Where are the opportunities? I don’t see any.”Comment CommentsGiftOutlineGift ArticleLoading...Loading...CompanyAbout The PostNewsroom Policies & StandardsDiversity and InclusionCareersMedia & Community RelationsWP Creative GroupAccessibility StatementGet The PostGift SubscriptionsMobile & AppsNewsletters & AlertsWashington Post LiveReprints & PermissionsPost StoreBooks & E-BooksNewspaper in EducationPrint Archives (Subscribers Only)e-ReplicaToday’s PaperContact UsContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareContact the Opinions teamAdvertiseLicensing & SyndicationRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipReport a VulnerabilityTerms of UseDigital Products Terms of SalePrint Products Terms of SaleTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyCookie SettingsSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choiceswashingtonpost.com © 1996-2022 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com© 1996-2022 The Washington PostAbout The PostContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipReport a VulnerabilityDownload the Washington Post AppPolicies & StandardsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyCookie SettingsPrint Products Terms of SaleDigital Products Terms of SaleSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choices",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/03/24/colombia-election-gustavo-petro/,3/24/2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Alastair Grant/AP)LONDON — He is one of the richest real estate moguls in the world, the prime minister of the United Arab Emirates and the ruler of the emirate of Dubai, the flashy party town and jet-setter hub in the Middle East. And, according to British courts, he’s a seriously bad dad.Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine.ArrowRightA British family judge ruled Thursday that Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum inflicted domestic abuse on an “exorbitant scale” against then-wife Princess Haya, awarding her sole custody of the couple’s two children.In a written judgment, the senior family court judge, Andrew McFarlane, stated that Mohammed had “consistently displayed coercive and controlling behaviour with respect to those members of his family who he regards as behaving contrary to his will.”Story continues below advertisementMohammed is a close ally of both Britain and the United States.The two-year legal battle — the divorce, financial settlement and custody fight — cast an unflattering light on the lavish lifestyles and jaw-dropping spending of Dubai’s ruling family, as well as the extent of Mohammed’s attempt to control his ex-wife, including the use of Israeli spyware.AdvertisementThe case began with Haya, the 47-year-old daughter of the late King Hussein of Jordan and Mohammed’s sixth and youngest wife. She said she feared for her life.The princess first escaped to Germany, then London in 2019, with the couple’s children: son Zayed, now 10, and daughter al-Jalila, now 14.Story continues below advertisementIn December, a British judge awarded Haya a record-breaking settlement — in excess of $720 million — in her custody battle.In addition to payments for 24/7 security, the court awarded Haya millions to cover the costs of the upkeep of her two homes, near Kensington Palace in London and in the suburban town of Egham in Surrey, as well as vacations, clothes and salaries for staff.The costs were diligently itemized — $500,000 for food during vacations; $368,000 to maintain three horses and other pets for the children; $51,000 to replace two Somersault sunken trampolines the family had owned at its palace in Dubai.AdvertisementLast year, the court heard that Mohammed had allegedly sought to buy a home near  Haya’s and issued threats, including a text message that said, “We can find you anywhere.”Story continues below advertisementEarlier in the proceedings, the court revealed that the ruler of Dubai used the Israeli NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware to hack the phones of his estranged wife and members of her inner circle.In Thursday’s ruling on child custody, McFarlane noted Mohammed’s failure to appear in court and his “absence of any acceptance of responsibility, expression of remorse or understanding of the impact of this behaviour on the mother.”Going forward, the judge said, the father will be limited to “indirect contact” with his children, allowed to see them through the phone but not in person.Haya, in a statement, said, “The last few years have been a frightening journey and yet the sanctuary, protection and extraordinary compassion we have experienced in England have strengthened our belief in the enduring power of both humanity and justice.”Mohammed’s representatives told the Guardian newspaper: “He loves his children and cherishes their love for him. He has always cared and provided for them, and always will. He maintains his denial of the allegations made in these contentious proceedings.”Liz Sly in London contributed to this report.Comment CommentsGiftOutlineGift ArticleLoading...Loading...CompanyAbout The PostNewsroom Policies & StandardsDiversity and InclusionCareersMedia & Community RelationsWP Creative GroupAccessibility StatementGet The PostGift SubscriptionsMobile & AppsNewsletters & AlertsWashington Post LiveReprints & PermissionsPost StoreBooks & E-BooksNewspaper in EducationPrint Archives (Subscribers Only)e-ReplicaToday’s PaperContact UsContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareContact the Opinions teamAdvertiseLicensing & SyndicationRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipReport a VulnerabilityTerms of UseDigital Products Terms of SalePrint Products Terms of SaleTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyCookie SettingsSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choiceswashingtonpost.com © 1996-2022 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com© 1996-2022 The Washington PostAbout The PostContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipReport a VulnerabilityDownload the Washington Post AppPolicies & StandardsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyCookie SettingsPrint Products Terms of SaleDigital Products Terms of SaleSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choices",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/03/24/dubai-mohammed-prince-court-uk/,3/24/2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Jason Oxenham/AP)Australia has accepted a nearly decade-old offer that would allow New Zealand to resettle hundreds of asylum seekers that Australia has held at offshore processing centers on the island nation of Nauru — a policy that has come under criticism from human rights groups.Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine.ArrowRightSince 2013, Australia has redirected people arriving by boat without visas to the detention camps on Nauru, a Pacific island nation around 2,000 miles from Australia’s shores, or Manus Island in Papua New Guinea. Australia also maintains a policy that prevents arrivals from ever resettling in Australia.The same year, New Zealand’s then-Prime Minister John Key offered to take in 150 of the detainees for three years. Since then, Kiwi leaders have reiterated the offer, including Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern: “We remain ready and willing to help,” Ardern’s office said in 2018.Doctors trying to help suicidal asylum seekers in Nauru have been banned from treating themAustralia has rebuffed the offer, saying that maintaining its hard-line immigration stance is a deterrent for future undocumented, and dangerous, sea journeys. The Aussies have also voiced concern that refugees brought to New Zealand would travel back to Australia for permanent settlement.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementNew Zealand Immigration Minister Kris Faafoi in a Thursday statement said he was “pleased that Australia has taken up the offer,” and glad that New Zealand is able to provide “resettlement outcomes for refugees who would otherwise have continued to face uncertain futures.”Even as Australia accepted the new policy, Australian officials reiterated their strong border policies.“This arrangement does not apply to anyone who attempts an illegal maritime journey to Australia in the future. Australia remains firm — illegal maritime arrivals will not settle here permanently. Anyone who attempts to breach our borders will be turned back or sent to Nauru,” Australian Minister for Home Affairs Karen Andrews said in a statement.Tennis star Novak Djokovic draws renewed attention to Australia’s ‘detention hotels’The Australia-run offshore processing centers have been controversial. Human rights groups said they constitute an international law violation and have denounced the centers’ conditions. Human Rights Watch in 2016 said refugees on Nauru suffer neglect and inhumane treatment — and even said the “government’s failure to address serious abuses appears to be a deliberate policy to deter further asylum seekers.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAround 112 refugees remain in Nauru and 105 in Papua New Guinea, according to the Refugee Council of Australia. Its data shows that 3,127 people have been sent offshore since July 2013 — with around 1,100 brought to Australia for temporary purposes and 993 settled in the United States. Australia announced in October that it would end its detention deal with Papua New Guinea, though its arrangement with Nauru would remain.Rights groups have sounded the alarm of a mental health crisis on Nauru. The Refugee Council of Australia said that experts described people transferred to Nauru as “among the most traumatized they have seen,” and Doctors Without Borders has also reported widespread severe mental health conditions, including self-harm and attempted suicide.One 23-year-old Iranian refugee set himself on fire in protest of conditions in Nauru in 2016, in front of three Canberra-based United Nations refugee agency officials. He died in a hospital two days after, and his partner has sued the Australian government for negligence. The same week, on the same island, a 21-year-old Somali asylum seeker set fire to herself.Comment CommentsGiftOutlineGift ArticleLoading...Loading...CompanyAbout The PostNewsroom Policies & StandardsDiversity and InclusionCareersMedia & Community RelationsWP Creative GroupAccessibility StatementGet The PostGift SubscriptionsMobile & AppsNewsletters & AlertsWashington Post LiveReprints & PermissionsPost StoreBooks & E-BooksNewspaper in EducationPrint Archives (Subscribers Only)e-ReplicaToday’s PaperContact UsContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareContact the Opinions teamAdvertiseLicensing & SyndicationRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipReport a VulnerabilityTerms of UseDigital Products Terms of SalePrint Products Terms of SaleTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyCookie SettingsSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choiceswashingtonpost.com © 1996-2022 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com© 1996-2022 The Washington PostAbout The PostContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipReport a VulnerabilityDownload the Washington Post AppPolicies & StandardsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyCookie SettingsPrint Products Terms of SaleDigital Products Terms of SaleSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choices",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/03/24/nauru-new-zealand-australia-refugee-offshore/,3/24/2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gorsuch, writing for himself and his eight colleagues, said members of Houston Community College’s Board of Trustees were within their rights to censure member David Wilson, just as he had the right to criticize their past actions.Story continues below advertisement“In this country, we expect elected representatives to shoulder a degree of criticism about their public service from their constituents and their peers — and to continue exercising their free speech rights when the criticism comes,” Gorsuch wrote.AdvertisementHe added: “The First Amendment surely promises an elected representative like Mr. Wilson the right to speak freely on questions of government policy. But just as surely, it cannot be used as a weapon to silence other representatives seeking to do the same.”Supreme Court sides with ‘subversive’ clothing designer in First Amendment caseWilson was more than just a vocal critic of his colleagues; he regularly accused fellow board members of corruption and, at one point, hired a private investigator to determine whether one lived in the proper district. The board in 2018 formally censured him for behavior “not only inappropriate, but reprehensible.”Story continues below advertisementWilson sued, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit said the lawsuit could continue.

Or “when the government interacts with private individuals as sovereign, employer, educator, or licensor, its threat of a censure could raise First Amendment questions.”But in cases in which the combatants are equal members of an elected board, “argument and counterargument” are the acceptable weapons for disputes, not litigation, Gorsuch wrote.The case is Houston Community College System v.

(iStock)FBI officials issued a warning Thursday following an increase in “sextortion” reports of teenage boys being targeted online by scam artists who entice them to share explicit content and then later extort money from the victims, officials said.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightAuthorities say scammers pose as young girls online via social media platforms and convince victims to produce sexual images and videos, according to statements released by the federal investigators. The victims typically range from 14 to 17 years old.In other instances, victims are encouraged to engage in explicit activity over video and the scammer secretly records the acts, FBI officials said. The scammers later attempt to extort money from victims by threatening to post the content online.Story continues below advertisementScammers ask for payment via cash apps and even with gift cards, said Special Agent Barbara Smith, who supervises the child exploitation and human trafficking task force at the FBI Washington Field Office. But even after some victims pay, the victims continue to be extorted.AdvertisementSmith said similar extortion schemes targeting men and boys have operated for years. But in the past six months, reports to the FBI out of the District and Northern Virginia increased    from one report a month to two or three each week, she said in an interview Thursday.“This has been going on for several years; what’s new is the frequency, and more children are falling victim to this scam,” Smith said. These financially motivated sextortion schemes that capture children are actually overshadowing the traditional child predator sextortion schemes that they have.”Story continues below advertisementInvestigators say  the suspected scammers are  abroad and   offenders may have hundreds of victims worldwide.“We recognize victims may feel embarrassed and thus hesitant to come forward and report these incidents,” said Wayne Jacobs, special agent in charge of the Washington Field Office’s criminal/cyber division. “The most effective way to disrupt these criminals is through awareness, education, and having important discussions with your children about their online safety.”AdvertisementSmith’s task force is involved because juveniles are producing pornographic images that can later be spread through underground networks across the Internet.Victims are being asked to  come forward so agents can upload the illegal images to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children database  to track them in case they appear in other investigations, Smith said.Story continues below advertisementAgency officials suggest parents limit who has access to social media accounts; block or ignore messages from strangers online; and to be suspicious of people their children meet in an online game or app and ask  to start talking to them on a different platform.Parents should encourage children to report suspicious behavior to adults, FBI officials said.“This is very traumatic for many high school, middle school-aged students, and we want to make sure they are getting the victims’ services they need,” Smith said.GiftOutlineGift ArticleLoading...Loading...CompanyAbout The PostNewsroom Policies & StandardsDiversity and InclusionCareersMedia & Community RelationsWP Creative GroupAccessibility StatementGet The PostGift SubscriptionsMobile & AppsNewsletters & AlertsWashington Post LiveReprints & PermissionsPost StoreBooks & E-BooksNewspaper in EducationPrint Archives (Subscribers Only)e-ReplicaToday’s PaperContact UsContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareContact the Opinions teamAdvertiseLicensing & SyndicationRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipReport a VulnerabilityTerms of UseDigital Products Terms of SalePrint Products Terms of SaleTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyCookie SettingsSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choiceswashingtonpost.com © 1996-2022 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com© 1996-2022 The Washington PostAbout The PostContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipReport a VulnerabilityDownload the Washington Post AppPolicies & StandardsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyCookie SettingsPrint Products Terms of SaleDigital Products Terms of SaleSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choices",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/03/24/fbi-warns-online-sextortion-scams-target-teens/,3/24/2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Robb Hill for The Washington Post) Jaclyn Corin, a survivor of the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., hopes lawmakers looked out the U.S. Capitol windows on Thursday and saw a grim representation of their failures.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightOn the National Mall on Thursday morning, activists used more than 1,100 body bags to spell out “Thoughts and prayers,” a condolence often invoked after mass shootings — and one that gun-violence-prevention activists decry as hollow, as more people continue to die.“This is still happening, and we need to step back into this to keep pushing and coercing our president and Congress to do something,” said Corin, 21, a co-founder of March for Our Lives and a government major at Harvard University. “If they continue to pursue a pathway of inaction, only more people are going to die.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIn the wake of the Parkland shooting, in which the attacker fatally shot 14 fellow students and three staff members, the survivors and other teenagers sparked a political movement demanding an end to school shootings and everyday gun violence. Four years ago Thursday, Corin and other survivors led hundreds of thousands of demonstrators in the District and across the country in protests to demand action. But the handful of activists gathered on the Mall on Thursday offered a much starker message.‘Never again!’ Students demand action against gun violence in nation’s capitalUnder gray skies, survivors of the Parkland shooting and others who had lost family and friends to shootings said they worked to elect President Biden and members of Congress who promised to act but did not. Surrounded by the body bags — bags stuffed with inflatable balloons that made them seem all too real — they said they were four years older and frustrated. While Democrats took the White House, Senate and House in 2020, no federal gun-control legislation has been passed.“I want this moment to act as a reminder of how angry and passionate we all felt back then,” Corin said. “The march in 2018 brought together so many people in this country in one collective mission to save lives.”Since the Parkland shooting, more than 170,000 people in the United States have died from guns, organizers said, citing Gun Violence Archive data. Each body bag in the installation on the Mall represents more than 150 deaths.Corin and others are calling on Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) to bring universal background checks to the Senate floor for a vote and are asking supporters to sign a petition, with a goal of 1.2 million signatures. A substantial majority of Americans — 89 percent — support requiring background checks for all gun buyers, according to an April 2021 Quinnipiac University poll. In response to a query from The Post, Schumer’s office pointed to his February comment to a reporter that he believes “very, very strongly” in continuing to pursue such legislation.Emma González hated guns before. Now, she’s speaking out on behalf of her dead classmates.Still, Corin called such a step the “bare minimum” and emphasized that the group is also asking Biden to do more to combat gun violence.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementDavid Hogg, a Parkland survivor and a 21-year-old Harvard University student, said those who care about gun violence should be ready to mount primary challenges against elected officials who have not worked for change. Politicians who say they support gun-control measures who do nothing, Hogg said, are worse than gun rights supporters, who are clear about where they stand: “At least the NRA doesn’t lie.”Analysis: Fact-checking Trump, NRA claims on gun background checksTrevon Bosley, 23, said he lost a brother and a cousin to shootings in Chicago in the mid-aughts. Though he’s been active in the anti-gun-violence movement since then, he said the crisis has only worsened.“We don’t care about thoughts and prayers,” he said. “I wake up and listen to sirens. You asked us to vote for you, and we did. We are not seeing the fruits of our labor.”Story continues below advertisementLast month, on the four-year anniversary of the school shooting, Manuel Oliver, father of Parkland shooting victim Joaquin Oliver, balanced on a construction crane near the White House, demanding a meeting with Biden and policies to combat gun violence. While he was 150 feet in the air, he unfurled a sign with a photo of his late son’s face.Four years after Parkland school massacre, parents of victims protest and mournOliver and his wife, Patricia Oliver, were hoping to bring attention to the initiative they launched with March for Our Lives and Guns Down America called Shock Market, which tracks gun violence since Biden’s inauguration.AdvertisementOn Thursday, Oliver said politicians shouldn’t expect support from survivors if they haven’t delivered results.“Do they think we’re going to do the same thing we did a couple of years ago?” he said. “We’re not making that mistake again.”The administration did not respond to a request for comment Thursday but previously pointed to actions the president has taken or attempted to take in the past year. The White House has claimed meaningful successes, including the hundreds of millions of dollars in stimulus funding that, at the administration’s urging, states and cities are using to address gun violence at the local level.Story continues below advertisementDuring the 2018 March for Our Lives, speakers did not focus just on mass shootings at suburban, White schools. They also emphasized the experiences of the far more common shootings that leave one or two young people dead and often affect predominantly Black and Hispanic students in poor neighborhoods.AdvertisementSince Parkland, at least 89,000 students have been exposed to gun violence on K-12 campuses during regular hours, according to a database from The Washington Post. In 105 shootings between February 2018 and the end of January, 28 people were killed and 90 were wounded. There were 42 school shootings in 2021 alone — more than in any other year since at least 1999 — despite ongoing closures of many schools during the pandemic.In D.C. and Maryland suburbs, homicides soared in 2021 to levels not seen in more than a decade, largely driven by firearms.Story continues below advertisementIn Montgomery County, which approached a number of killings not seen in at least 46 years, Police Chief Marcus Jones said he has “never seen the amount of guns and gun activity that is currently on our streets.” Christopher Geldart, the District’s deputy mayor for public safety and justice, told residents at an October meeting on Capitol Hill that there is “a gun crisis in the city.”AdvertisementFour years ago, students from Parkland and the D.C. region turned their pain into inspiration, believing they could persuade adults to enact legislation that protects future generations from gun violence.The lives lost in the Parkland school shootingBut in the absence of change, Daud Mumin, a 20-year-old from Salt Lake City who’s co-chair of the board of directors for March for Our Lives, said the body bags on the Mall reflect a “very dark reality.”Story continues below advertisement“Both nationally and in D.C., we’d love the conversation to be a reckoning of the past four years,” said Mumin, who graduated from Westminster College in December with a degree in justice studies. “We’re putting pressure on Congress, we’re putting pressure on the president, and we’re urging people to join this movement and to join in putting pressure on their respective politicians and legislators to really take this issue seriously.”John Woodrow Cox and Emily Guskin contributed to this report.Comment CommentsGiftOutlineGift ArticleLoading...Loading...CompanyAbout The PostNewsroom Policies & StandardsDiversity and InclusionCareersMedia & Community RelationsWP Creative GroupAccessibility StatementGet The PostGift SubscriptionsMobile & AppsNewsletters & AlertsWashington Post LiveReprints & PermissionsPost StoreBooks & E-BooksNewspaper in EducationPrint Archives (Subscribers Only)e-ReplicaToday’s PaperContact UsContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareContact the Opinions teamAdvertiseLicensing & SyndicationRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipReport a VulnerabilityTerms of UseDigital Products Terms of SalePrint Products Terms of SaleTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyCookie SettingsSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choiceswashingtonpost.com © 1996-2022 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com© 1996-2022 The Washington PostAbout The PostContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipReport a VulnerabilityDownload the Washington Post AppPolicies & StandardsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyCookie SettingsPrint Products Terms of SaleDigital Products Terms of SaleSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choices",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/03/24/parkland-protest-dc-gun-violence/,3/24/2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Along the Interstate 95 corridor, low temperatures will plunge below freezing.New Orleans multi-vortex tornado rated ‘at least’ EF3, strongest since 2017Milder weather will try to return by the middle of next week, but, on balance, chillier-than-average weather may hang around for the next seven to 10 days or so.How cold and when?Chilly air will begin spilling into the eastern United States on Friday, but the core of the cold arrives over the weekend and lasts through early next week. That’s when temperatures will generally be about 10 to 20 degrees below seasonal norms. In some areas on Monday, the departures from normal could be as much as 30 degrees.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThese departures translate to the following temperatures in these cities:Chicago: Highs near 40 Saturday through Monday, with lows in the 20s.Cincinnati: Highs 40 to 45 Saturday through Monday, with lows in the 20s.Nashville: Highs in the mid-to-upper 50s Friday through Sunday, with lows in the 30s.Raleigh: Highs in the mid-to-upper 50s Saturday through Monday, with lows in the 30s.Washington: Highs near 55 on Saturday, 45 to 50 Sunday, and near 45 Monday. Lows near 30 Sunday and Monday (20s in suburbs).Buffalo: Highs near 35 Sunday and 25 to 30 on Monday. Lows near 20 Sunday through Tuesday. Some accumulating snow is possible Sunday.New York: Highs 45 to 50 Sunday and 35 to 40 on Monday. Lows 25 to 30 Monday and Tuesday.Boston: Highs near 50 Sunday, near 35 Monday and near 40 Tuesday. Lows in the 20s Monday and Tuesday.These temperatures are much more typical of late February or early March, rather than late March.On Sunday and Monday, the Upper Midwest, Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, most of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast will all endure freezing early-morning temperatures. In Washington, these temperatures will probably end the peak bloom of the cherry blossoms.Cherry blossoms explode, reach peak bloom 10 days ahead of averageGusty winds will intensify the cold. Forecast wind chills on Monday morning dip into the teens in the northern Mid-Atlantic and single digits in much of the interior Northeast. Subzero wind chills are even possible in the mountains.Where snow is possibleA vigorous high-altitude disturbance will drop from the Upper Midwest on Friday into the northern Mid-Atlantic on Saturday. It will generate periods of snow in the central and northern Appalachian Mountains and also enhance lake-effect snow bands downwind of the Great Lakes on Friday night and Saturday.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementEven at lower elevations, ice pellets or graupel could mix with rain showers, including along the I-95 corridor from Washington to Boston on Saturday afternoon.As a second disturbance passes through the Northeast on Sunday, more snow showers are possible downwind of the Great Lakes and on the westward facing slopes (upslope areas) of the Appalachians.At least several inches of snow could fall downwind lakes Erie and Ontario, as well as in the high elevations of the Appalachians. Amounts will tend to increase with elevation.The cause of the cold patternWeather systems are favorably configuring themselves for this wintry pattern. Significantly, a blocking zone of high pressure is setting up over Greenland. That’s forcing the jet stream, which divides cold air and warm air, to dive south over eastern North America. This is reflected by the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). When the NAO is negative, the weather over the eastern U.S. tends to be colder than normal.Such a pattern was seldom seen during the core winter months, which resulted in generally above-normal temperatures.Weather models show this negative NAO pattern persisting for a week to 10 days, although it will probably be strongest through early next week. As it weakens after that, forecast models simulate more variable temperatures in the eastern United States.While the East shivers amid this pattern, the West will simmer. Temperatures are forecast to be 10 to 30 degrees above normal from the western Plains to the Pacific Coast Saturday through Monday.Record highs in the 80s and 90s are forecast over interior California and southern Arizona on Friday. Over the weekend, record highs well into the 70s are predicted to spread through Nevada and southern Idaho on Saturday to parts of Wyoming and Colorado on Sunday, including Denver.Comment CommentsGiftOutlineGift ArticleLoading...Washington, D.C., Snow Tracker13.2""Current total snowfallAverage season-to-date snow13.6""Average seasonal snow13.7""Last year's snow5.4""Record most snow56.1""Record least snow0.1""See the winter outlookLoading...Tweets by @capitalweatherCompanyAbout The PostNewsroom Policies & StandardsDiversity and InclusionCareersMedia & Community RelationsWP Creative GroupAccessibility StatementGet The PostGift SubscriptionsMobile & AppsNewsletters & AlertsWashington Post LiveReprints & PermissionsPost StoreBooks & E-BooksNewspaper in EducationPrint Archives (Subscribers Only)e-ReplicaToday’s PaperContact UsContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareContact the Opinions teamAdvertiseLicensing & SyndicationRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipReport a VulnerabilityTerms of UseDigital Products Terms of SalePrint Products Terms of SaleTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyCookie SettingsSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choiceswashingtonpost.com © 1996-2022 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com© 1996-2022 The Washington PostAbout The PostContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipReport a VulnerabilityDownload the Washington Post AppPolicies & StandardsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyCookie SettingsPrint Products Terms of SaleDigital Products Terms of SaleSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choices",https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2022/03/24/spring-pause-eastern-us-snow/,3/24/2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Tamir Kalifa/Austin American-Statesman via AP, File)Alex Jones’s lawyers told a judge on Tuesday that the Infowars founder was too sick to answer questions under oath at his court-ordered deposition the next day.Their arguments were similar to those they had made the day before in a written motion requesting a postponement in the court case in which relatives of those killed in the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School sued him for calling the massacre a “giant hoax.” A delay was necessary, they said, because a doctor “remains firm in his initial recommendation that Mr. Jones neither attend a deposition nor return to work” since he “stands at serious risk of harm.”WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightBut Jones was at work right around the time they were making those very arguments to the judge, they later conceded. Specifically, he was at his recording studio in Austin in the middle of broadcasting four hours of “The Alex Jones Show.” Just as his lawyers were about to argue he was too sick to testify, Jones warned listeners that a cabal of global elites plan to start a nuclear war or otherwise trigger a global crisis in the coming months to cover up massive financial crimes they’ve committed over the decades.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementConnecticut state Judge Barbara Bellis denied the motion for a postponement. But Jones didn’t show for the deposition scheduled Wednesday. Bellis has now ordered Jones to appear Thursday to give sworn testimony. Opposing lawyers requested the judge issue a warrant for Jones’s arrest if he fails to show again.Jones’s lawyers and Infowars did not respond Wednesday night to a request for comment from The Washington Post.Jones is being sued by multiple families whose relatives died in the mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. For years, Sandy Hook families have said Jones was grifting off claims that the shooting — in which 20 children and six school staffers were killed — was a “false flag” operation staged by “crisis actors.” During a 2019 deposition, he renounced those statements and admitted the shooting had happened, blaming his previous false claims on “a form of psychosis.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“I talk four hours a day, and I can’t remember what I talked about sometimes a week ago,” Jones said during that deposition.Alex Jones must pay damages to Sandy Hook families in another defamation case, judge rulesIn 2018, several of them sued Jones for defamation in Texas and Connecticut. In November, after years of litigation, Judge Bellis ruled that Jones was liable by default in the Connecticut case after he and his companies refused to obey court orders to provide financial records and other documents, The Post reported.Bellis said Jones and his companies engaged in “a pattern of obstructive conduct” that thwarted the normal court process and prevented the Sandy Hook families from pursing their case.After the judge ruled against Jones, the case moved to a phase in which a jury will eventually decide how much Jones will have to pay in damages, which is why the deposition is still necessary.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAttorneys representing several Sandy Hook families said in filings that Jones was supposed to be deposed late last year, but the proceeding had been delayed several times. During a deposition, lawyers for the families would have the opportunity to ask Jones questions on the record under oath. His answers might later be used in a trial if the case doesn’t come to a settlement.In requesting another postponement, one of Jones’s lawyers, Norman Pattis, said in a court filing Monday that he had received a phone call earlier that day about his client’s health. The caller, whom Pattis didn’t identify in his motion, told him that Jones was being cared for by a doctor for “medical conditions that require immediate, and possibly, emergency testing.” Pattis told the court he then spoke with someone claiming to be that doctor, who recommended Jones not go through with the deposition.Jones asked his lawyer not to disclose his medical conditions or the identity of the doctor caring for him in the court record, Pattis said. His attorneys submitted earlier this week to the judge a letter that was supposedly from the doctor.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIt didn’t sway her. In denying his motion, Bellis acknowledged that the health problems the doctor outlined were “potentially serious."" But, the judge continued, they weren’t serious enough for Jones to obey the doctor’s orders to stay home and rest, opting instead to keep broadcasting from his studio.“Mr. Jones cannot unilaterally decide to continue to engage in his broadcasts, but refuse to participate in a deposition,” she wrote in her order denying his motion.An attorney representing the Sandy Hook families suing Jones called the doctor’s note and the sickness claim “completely bogus.”The “obvious gambit,” lawyer Christopher Mattei wrote in court documents, “represents yet another threadbare attempt to delay these proceedings and to shield Mr. Jones from an experience that puts him in peril — not because he is ill but because he will be under oath and bound to tell the truth.”Mattei later denounced Jones’s bid for a delay as “a cowardly display intended to cheat the plaintiffs of their right to put him under oath and ask him questions,” Connecticut Public Radio reported.Reis Thebault and Timothy Bella contributed to this report.Comment CommentsGiftOutlineGift ArticleLoading...Loading...CompanyAbout The PostNewsroom Policies & StandardsDiversity and InclusionCareersMedia & Community RelationsWP Creative GroupAccessibility StatementGet The PostGift SubscriptionsMobile & AppsNewsletters & AlertsWashington Post LiveReprints & PermissionsPost StoreBooks & E-BooksNewspaper in EducationPrint Archives (Subscribers Only)e-ReplicaToday’s PaperContact UsContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareContact the Opinions teamAdvertiseLicensing & SyndicationRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipReport a VulnerabilityTerms of UseDigital Products Terms of SalePrint Products Terms of SaleTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyCookie SettingsSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choiceswashingtonpost.com © 1996-2022 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com© 1996-2022 The Washington PostAbout The PostContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipReport a VulnerabilityDownload the Washington Post AppPolicies & StandardsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyCookie SettingsPrint Products Terms of SaleDigital Products Terms of SaleSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choices",https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/03/24/alex-jones-sandy-hook-deposition/,3/24/2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mike Crapo of Idaho, seen during a GOP news conference Feb. 16 on Capitol Hill, has objected to a Democratic request to immediately approve a House-passed bill to end normal trade relations with Russia, saying it should include language banning Russian oil imports. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)A bill that would add Russia and Belarus to a short list of pariah states that do not enjoy preferential U.S. trade status has stalled in the Senate as lawmakers spar over whether to attach other measures, such as a ban on Russian oil and gas imports.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightThe trade bill passed the House on a 424-to-8 vote last week, and Democrats are pushing to quickly pass it in the Senate so President Biden can sign it as he meets with key allies in Europe later this week to strategize further responses to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.“It is so important we show unity right now [as] President Biden meets with our European allies,” Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in floor remarks Wednesday. “Swift Senate action, combining Democrats and Republicans with one voice supporting [an end to Russia’s trade preferences] would do just that.”House votes to strip Russia of trade status, but Congress treads carefully on Ukraine crisisBut Sen. Mike Crapo (Idaho), the top Republican on the powerful Senate Finance Committee, objected to Schumer’s request to immediately pass the House bill — citing the other chamber’s decision to drop language on banning Russian energy imports that had previously been included in a handshake agreement between key congressional leaders.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“None of this is controversial, and all of it is necessary,” Crapo said Tuesday, calling the trade and energy bills “complementary.”Both the trade sanctions and the energy import ban have already been the subject of executive action by Biden. But many in Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, have pushed for congressional action to codify Biden’s orders and show bipartisan comity in the quest to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin for his decision to invade Ukraine.But accord has been hard to come by in recent months. After moments of talks, Democrats and Republicans could not come together on a Russia sanctions bill ahead of the late-February invasion — a package that some senators believed would show Western resolve and perhaps deter Putin from further action.Story continues below advertisementSince the invasion, lawmakers of both parties have pushed Biden to do more to deliver military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine and take a series of escalating steps to punish Russia. A $13.6 billion Ukrainian aid package was included in a vast spending bill that Biden signed into law earlier this month.AdvertisementBut bills to crack down on Russian trade, ban its energy imports, impose new restrictions on U.S. companies doing business in Russia, demand war-crimes investigations, transfer MiG jets and other materiel to Ukraine, and other measures have yet to reach Biden’s desk because of political and policy tussles.A deal, however, appeared to be within reach Wednesday. After Schumer and Crapo sparred on the floor, the two men agreed to keep negotiating in hopes of sealing a deal to advance the trade and energy bills before the Senate finishes its business for the week on Thursday.Story continues below advertisementThe energy import ban, like the trade bill, had broad bipartisan support in the House. But some senators, including Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Joe Manchin III (D-W-Va.), raised concerns about language in the House bill that would delay the ban for 45 days — potentially giving importers more time to arrange and settle transactions.AdvertisementCrapo on Wednesday said he would agree to drop that provision to speed up action on the energy ban legislation, which he said would “demonstrate to the Ukrainian people and our NATO allies that Congress is committed to cutting off Russia’s funding for its war effort” and potentially persuade U.S. allies who are more dependent on Russian oil and gas to follow suit.“I’m willing to make these concessions to get this done,” he said. “My view is that we should act quickly.”Story continues below advertisementBut he warned that other senators could have requests of their own for additions or subtractions that could obstruct a deal. Passing the legislation this week would require the consent of all 100 senators.One potential complication is that the House trade bill includes a permanent expansion of the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, a law that gives the U.S. government broad authority to impose sanctions on those found to have engaged in human rights abuses or serious acts of corruption.AdvertisementA handful of House conservatives cited that provision — which expands applicability of the Magnitsky law from those engaging in “gross” human rights violations to merely “serious” violations — in opposing the legislation last week. One lawmaker, Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.), said the change could give a president the power to “threaten other countries to turn on their Christian heritage and change their laws to align with the views of the current White House.”Story continues below advertisementBut Crapo said he supported its passage, and no senator has publicly objected. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) said Wednesday that allowing the Magnitsky Act, named after an anti-corruption crusader who died in a Russian prison, to expire would “send exactly the wrong message at the most critical time” and called for immediate passage of the extension.“Look, there are burned bodies in the streets of Ukraine. There are mass graves to bury the dead. There are Ukrainians who are melting snow in order to drink water to survive. So it’s truly mind-boggling that we cannot get this legislation passed,” said Menendez.Comment CommentsGiftOutlineGift ArticleUNDERSTANDING THE RUSSIA-UKRAINE CONFLICTHAND CURATEDMaps of Russia’s invasion of UkraineNews•March 28, 2022What to know about Ukraine’s Lviv, hit by missiles as Biden was 250 miles awayNews•March 27, 2022The ‘deglobalization’ of Moscow  March 25, 2022View 3 more storiesChevronDownLoading...Loading...CompanyAbout The PostNewsroom Policies & StandardsDiversity and InclusionCareersMedia & Community RelationsWP Creative GroupAccessibility StatementGet The PostGift SubscriptionsMobile & AppsNewsletters & AlertsWashington Post LiveReprints & PermissionsPost StoreBooks & E-BooksNewspaper in EducationPrint Archives (Subscribers Only)e-ReplicaToday’s PaperContact UsContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareContact the Opinions teamAdvertiseLicensing & SyndicationRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipReport a VulnerabilityTerms of UseDigital Products Terms of SalePrint Products Terms of SaleTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyCookie SettingsSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choiceswashingtonpost.com © 1996-2022 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com© 1996-2022 The Washington PostAbout The PostContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipReport a VulnerabilityDownload the Washington Post AppPolicies & StandardsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyCookie SettingsPrint Products Terms of SaleDigital Products Terms of SaleSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choices",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/23/russia-trade-senate/,3/23/2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)Metro unveiled a plan Thursday that would gradually ease a train shortage through the summer, proposing a path to service beginning in May for its suspended rail cars as the transit agency records its highest ridership levels of the pandemic.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightThe plan outlines the eventual return of Metro’s 7000-series rail cars, which have been sidelined since a Blue Line train derailed in October. The transit agency said it is continuing to work toward a long-term solution to a five-month train shortage that has removed 60 percent of its fleet amid a federal safety investigation.Metro’s proposal has been in the works for three months but offers no cause or solution for the mysterious defect that has plagued the wheels of nearly two dozen 7000-series cars, forcing all 748 out of service. The plan is Metro’s most detailed accounting yet of how the agency hopes to begin emerging from its biggest crisis in seven years, coming amid reduced public confidence and a pandemic that has battered its finances.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe tentative timeline for the return of increased rail service came during a Metro board meeting Thursday in which transit officials said the Silver Line extension to Loudoun County would be delayed until at least summer because of “nonnegotiable” construction issues. The 11-mile extension, built by the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, has faced numerous delays and originally was scheduled to be completed in July 2018.Metro’s new proposal for boosting rail service doesn’t provide immediate service upgrades but relies on adding trains over several months to reduce wait times that are frustrating commuters. Metro had previously said the 7000 series would not return before April.Have you changed or are you considering changes to your commute? The Post wants to hear from you.Faced with trains and stations becoming increasingly busy — as well as the task this year of opening the six-station Silver Line extension — Metrorail is hoping for quick approval from its regulatory agency for an automated wheel screening system to test, then reinstate, its 7000-series cars.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe safety commission suspended use of the cars until Metro could prove it solved the problem or could operate the trains safely. Metro experts and safety commission officials say cars can return safely if they are regularly monitored for the slightest signs of wheel movements. The defect’s slow progression allows for early detection long before it becomes significant enough to derail a train.If Metro’s plan — which had not been submitted Thursday — wins the support of the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission, the transit agency would reduce Green and Yellow line waits to 15 minutes by May with an influx of older trains, while gradually phasing the 7000 series into service this summer. By the end of summer, transit officials said, the returning cars would help to reduce waits on the Blue, Orange and Silver lines to 15 minutes, with less time at stations served by multiple lines. Those wait times are comparable to off-peak frequencies before the pandemic.“As Congressional and regional leaders have made clear, our ability to work together toward our common goal is crucial as our customers, businesses, employers, and governments are counting on us to get back to work and restore normalcy following the worst public health crisis in a generation,” Metro Board Chairman Paul C. Smedberg said in a letter laying out the plan to the safety commission.Metro says multiple factors likely to blame for rail car defectThe suspension of Metro’s most advanced and previously most reliable cars has challenged the agency at a time when ridership and revenue continue to suffer from the prevalence of telework. Still, demand is high among riders for frequent and reliable service as passengers seek social distancing onboard and the shorter wait times they were accustomed to before the pandemic.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementTrains that had been running at 20 percent of pre-pandemic levels have recently been carrying more passengers, creating standing-room conditions during peak hours, partly because of the limited number of trains in the system. On Tuesday, Metrorail reported about 245,000 trips, the biggest daily total since the pandemic began and nearly 40 percent of early 2020 levels.On Tuesday, March 22, about 245,000 trips were taken on Metrorail, the highest ridership recorded since the pandemic began. Welcome back! 👋#wmata— Metro (@wmata) March 23, 2022

Metro is the nation’s third-largest rail transit system, with a fleet of about 1,200 rail cars. The 7000-series cars, built by Kawasaki Rail, entered service in 2015 at a cost of about $2 million apiece.Metro’s recent troubles began when a National Transportation Safety Board investigation into the derailment outside the Arlington Cemetery station revealed that wheels on one car had shifted two inches farther apart, causing them to slip from the track. Investigators ordered emergency inspections of the fleet and learned that a small number of cases had been found during routine inspections as early as 2017. Then, last year, occurrences of the flaw grew significantly.Metro orders measurement devices to hasten end to train shortageIn December, the safety commission lifted its suspension, allowing Metro to use the cars under a plan that would monitor the wheels for increased spacing or shifting through daily inspections.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementBut the commission reimposed the suspension about two weeks later, when inspectors learned that Metro was not following its plan. Metro also determined that hand-measuring the spacing between wheels daily was unfeasible.Transit officials at the time said they would take three months to search for the cause of the malfunction while scouring the railroad industry for technology that could automate the measurements.Metro General Manager Paul J. Wiedefeld said Thursday the cause of the defect continues to elude Metro’s engineers and experts, who suspect a mix of factors. Wiedefeld said Metro’s investigation is in a testing phase that includes re-creating operational conditions that might shed light on the flaw.Story continues below advertisement“As the cause appears to be a combination of factors, I do not expect a near-term solution,” he said.Metro working on plan to bring suspended cars back into serviceWith ridership, road congestion and gas prices rising, Wiedefeld said Metro’s immediate strategy to head off crowding on trains involves restoring 50 of its 6000-series cars, which are mostly unavailable since the model was taken out of service in November 2020 because of multiple train separations.AdvertisementThe transit system has rebuilt much of the “coupler” system, and it began slowly phasing in the cars in October. Wiedefeld said Metro hopes to have the 50 additional cars back in service by May, if the safety commission certifies them. The cars would provide an additional seven or eight six-car trains, on top of at least 50 that Metro has in service.Metro says train shortage to last three more months while agency seeks ‘root cause’ of defectAt the same time, Wiedefeld said, Metro will work toward getting the safety commission’s approval for a digital gauge to measure wheelsets that Metro plans to use along multiple automatic wayside inspection stations. The stations, which will be installed along the track in the coming weeks, take measurements as trains pass.Story continues below advertisementMetro plans to use both the automatic and manual measurement methods until it can slowly shift fully to the automatic measurements.Metro suspends more than half of its rail cars after investigation uncovers safety problemsSmedberg on Thursday urged the safety commission to act quickly.Advertisement“We cannot wait until the end of these safety processes and protocols to get approvals,” he said. “We need timely decisions to be made as we go, or this will continue to drag on.”Safety commission spokesman Max Smith said his agency is in daily contact with Metro, but added that the commission can’t act unless Metro submits a plan to operate the trains safely.“[Metro] has not submitted a 7000 series return-to-service plan to us as required by and described in our order, so we do not have any specific action item,” he said. “We continue to work with them closely to make sure that they’re sharing information with us and that we can provide any feedback as soon as we can.”Silver Line extension takes a large step forward with completion of rail yard at Dulles AirportWiedefeld also told the board Thursday that because of continuing issues with construction of the Silver Line, he does not expect passenger service to begin on the line’s second phase until at least July.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementWhile the transit agency had not set a date for when the extension would begin carrying passengers, earlier timelines laid out by the agency indicated service could begin in the first half of this year.“This is critical to getting people out of cars as they head back to work to alleviate road congestion,” Smedberg said. “But it’s also very critical to the region’s economy.”Thursday’s update from Metro was a stark contrast to the update offered to the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority Board at its meeting last week. Board members were told the Silver Line was continuing to move forward and that outstanding issues were being resolved.MWAA officials said they continue to work closely with contractors to fix issues standing in the way of opening the rail line. In response to criticism of MWAA’s management of the project, authority spokesman David Mould noted the complexity of building the rail line.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“A project of this size and this importance is a very complicated thing,” he said. “A lot of issues are expected to come up. We believe that everyone is working well together. We believe we are making good progress toward the goal of providing a safe, reliable system.”The delay is proving costly for the airports authority. Last week, project officials told the board it paid Capital Rail Constructors, the contactor responsible for building the rail line, an additional $4 million for its continued oversight of the line, which will continue until Metro is ready to move to the next phase in the project’s completion.The issues Metro has raised include a lack of building occupancy certificates, missing certifications for a yard signal system and orange, boot-shaped cable connector assemblies that provide power for the rails.“I know the board shares my extreme disappointment that we will not be cutting the ribbon together on the Silver Line this spring,” Wiedefeld said. “The reality is, we don’t control when the airport and their contractor finish their work. We don’t control that. So once they do that, once they’ve done their work, then we get in to do what we do.”Fairfax County Board of Supervisors Chairman Jeffrey C. McKay (D-At Large) said delays have become commonplace for the project.“I’m very frustrated by this latest setback,” he said in a text message. “While these new specific problems may fall on [the airports authority] and the contractor, at the end of the day, my frustration throughout these non-relenting delays is with all parties involved.”Metro’s next rail cars to be built at new $70 million Maryland plantAlso Thursday, Maryland state Sen. Malcolm L. Augustine (D-Prince George’s) lodged a complaint with Metro’s board about Hitachi Rail’s process in choosing a Hagerstown site to build Metro’s 8000-series cars. The company announced last week it selected a 41-acre site for a 307,000-square-foot factory that will assemble 256 Metro cars starting in 2024. The $2.2 billion contract for the project, which includes an option for 800 more cars, included a stipulation that a plant be built in the Mid-Atlantic region.Augustine, a former Metro board member, said the county was interested in the factory and asked Hitachi about the selection process twice last year, but did not get a reply. Augustine said a site within Metro’s service area would have created local jobs and increased cooperation and synchronicity between Metro and Hitachi.“I have not heard back from Hitachi on this matter, but I felt it very important for me to bring this to your attention for immediate review and we will be doing the same from Annapolis,” he said.In a statement Friday, Hitachi Rail officials did not say whether Prince George’s was considered for the factory. The company selected the Hagerstown site because of its proximity to Washington and other rail markets across the Northeast, the statement said.

OffOnPrince William describes 'profound sorrow' over slavery in Jamaica speechWilliam and Kate have faced ongoing protests during their tour of the Caribbean.ByKatie Kindelan andBriana StewartviaMarch 24, 2022, 4:14 PM• 9 min readShare to FacebookShare to TwitterEmail this article5:17The British Royals’ colonial tour draws backlashABC News’ Erielle Reshef reports on Prince William and Kate’s royal Caribbean tour as locals demand slavery reparations and call for a reckoning with their colonial past.Toby Melville/ReutersPrince William delivered a speech Wednesday in Jamaica expressing his ""profound sorrow"" over the history of slavery, as he and his wife, Duchess Kate, have faced protests on their Caribbean tour.""I want to express my profound sorrow. Slavery was abhorrent. And it should never have happened,"" William said at a state dinner hosted by Jamaica’s governor general and attended by local dignitaries and senior politicians.""While the pain runs deep, Jamaica continues to forge its future with determination, courage and fortitude,"" William said in his remarks. ""I strongly agree with my father, the prince of Wales, who said in Barbados last year that the appalling atrocity of slavery forever stains our history.”""The strength and shared sense of purpose of the Jamaican people, represented in your flag and motto, celebrate an invincible spirit,"" he continued. ""It is this same spirit that spurred on the Windrush generation, who came to the United Kingdom to help rebuild after the Second World War. We are forever grateful for the immense contribution that this generation and their descendants have made to British life, which continues to enrich and improve our society.""William's speech came just hours after he and Kate met with Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness, who told them that while he was ""happy"" to welcome them to Jamaica, the country is on its way to becoming a republic.Jamaica becoming a republic would mean removing Queen Elizabeth, William's grandmother, as its head of state.As monarch, Queen Elizabeth is the head of the British Commonwealth, representing 54 nations, including Belize, Jamaica and the Bahamas, which William and Kate will visit next.Editor's PicksQueen Elizabeth marks 70 years on the throne: 7 memorable momentsDuchess Kate recycles Alexander McQueen gown for Earthshot Prize Awards green carpetPrince William and Kate go on their 1st royal walkabout since pandemicAnother Caribbean country, Barbados, became a republic last year, no longer pledging allegiance to the queen.William and Kate, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, are on a goodwill tour to Belize, Jamaica and the Bahamas to celebrate the queen's Platinum Jubilee, marking her 70 years on the throne.MORE: Amid royal visit, Jamaican official says country 'moving towards becoming a republic'The Cambridges were forced to cancel one of their first stops in Belize over the weekend when protests led by indigenous people broke out ahead of their arrival.On Tuesday, the day of William and Kate's arrival in Jamaica, dozens of protesters gathered in Kingston to protest the visit.A group known as the Advocates Network, which describes itself as a ""non-partisan alliance of individuals and organizations advocating for human rights and good governance,"" also published an open letter protesting the royals' visit, saying that British rule has ""perpetuated the greatest human rights tragedy in the history of humankind.""MORE: Prince William, Kate face protests on Caribbean tourRobert Nesta Morgan, who holds the position as minister without portfolio within Jamaica's government -- a spokesperson for Jamaica's government -- told ABC News that there is consensus within the country, and agreement between the Jamaican government and opposition leadership that the country is ""moving towards becoming a republic.""""We already have political independence. We're an independent country,"" he said. ""But there is a symbolism as to who is the head of state that many persons, including inside and outside of government, wish to change.""Prime Minister Holness appointed Marlene Malahoo Forte, the country's former attorney general, to be the minister of constitutional affairs, which took effect in January. Her new role, in part, oversees and advises the government as it seeks to transition to republic status.Malahoo Forte told the Jamaica Observer in December that Holness gave her instructions for the constitution to be amended for the purposes of becoming a republic.In addition to the calls for Jamaica to become a republic, activists have also been demanding slavery reparations in many of their demonstrations around William and Kate's visit.William did not mention reparations in his remarks on slavery Wednesday.In July, Jamaica announced plans to ask Britain for compensation for the Atlantic slave trade in the former British colony, according to Reuters, noting the total amount could be ""billions of pounds.""Morgan told ABC News this week that people in Jamaica are looking for ""recognition of the damage"" done by slavery.""The pursuit of reparations is not dependent on the acknowledgment of the oppressor that they have oppressed someone. It is based on the experience of those who are oppressed,"" he said. ""There are many persons in our society who have been fighting really hard for many decades for a recognition of not just the damage that slavery has done to our society, but also a recognition of the need to do repairing of that damage through reparations.""William and Kate have so far not commented publicly on the controversy surrounding their visit.Ricardo Makyn/AFP via Getty ImagesWife of Jamaican Prime Minister Juliet Holness, Prince William, the Governor General of Jamaica Patrick Allen and his wife Lady Allen, Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, and Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness attend a state dinner at Kings House in Kingston, Jamaica, March 23, 2022.While in Jamaica, the couple played soccer with locals and visited a teacher's college to talk about early childhood development, a particular focus of Kate's work.They also visited with medical staff at a local hospital.William and Kate will spend the next two full days in the Bahamas before returning to the U.K. on Sunday.Comments (0)Share to FacebookShare to TwitterEmail this articleTop StoriesFDA authorizes 4th COVID shot for everyone over 503 hours agoWhat to know about a 2nd COVID-19 booster for people over age 50Mar 29, 6:02 AMJada Pinkett Smith posts about 'healing' following Will Smith's apology to Chris Rock2 hours agoRep.

But some New Yorkers who are still required to show proof of vaccination are calling foul on what they see as a double standard.New York City Mayor Eric Adams announced Thursday that he was dropping the mandate that all city-based athletes and performers show proof of vaccination to take part in their game or event. Adams said his decision was based on the city's low COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations and the city's goal to restart its economy.""We have to be on the field in order to win,"" Adams said during a news conference at Citi Field, where unvaccinated Mets players will no longer have to worry about not playing when the baseball season begins next month.Frank Franklin II/APUtah Jazz's Hassan Whiteside, center, and Brooklyn Nets' Bruce Brown fight for control of the ball as Nets' Nic Claxton and Kevin Durant watch during the second half of an NBA basketball game on March 21, 2022, in New York.Until Thursday’s announcement, unvaccinated athletes could not play home games, because venues required everyone to be vaccinated for entry. Visiting players and entertainers, however, were exempt.MORE: NYC drops most COVID mask and vaccine requirementsThis affected the Brooklyn Nets after its star point guard, Kyrie Irving, repeatedly refused to get vaccinated.Irving was listed inactive during the first three months of the season but was called up in January for road games. He scored 43 points in his last game Wednesday against the Memphis Grizzlies.Adams said the old rules put teams and performers at a disadvantage.""This is about putting New York City performers on a level playing field,"" Adams said.Erik Pendzich/ShutterstockNew York City Mayor Eric Adams speaks at Citi Field in New York, March 24, 2022.Broadway performers represented by Actors Equity previously agreed to mandatory vaccinations.""Broadway theatres anticipate no change in our protocols based on this announcement. We continue to evaluate our COVID safety protocols for audiences, cast and crew, in concert with our unions and medical experts,"" Charlotte St. Martin, the president of The Broadway League, said.The mayor added that the decision will help the venues and employees who work in the arenas and entertainment venues and local businesses.MORE: Nearly 1,500 NYC municipal workers fired for not being vaccinated against COVIDBut not everyone was thrilled with the mayor's decision, particularly some unions representing city workers who are required to show proof of vaccination to work.""There can’t be one system for the elite and another for the essential workers of our city.

Adams also expressed concerns about the ""ambiguous messages"" sent to New Yorkers about vaccine requirements.""This exemption sends the wrong message that higher-paid workers and celebrities are being valued as more important than our devoted civil servants, which I reject. This is a step away from following sensible public health-driven policies that prioritize equity,"" she said in a statement.MORE: Return to pre-pandemic normalcy not yet on the horizon for many immunocompromised AmericansEarlier in the month, the mayor dropped the requirement for indoor businesses and venues, including movie theaters, to have their customers show proof of vaccination and wear a mask. He also dropped the mask mandate for schools and is set to drop the mask mandate for children 2- to 4-years old.As of Thursday, 77.5% of all New Yorkers were fully vaccinated, and 36.3% of residents had received their booster dose, according to the city's Health Department.The mayor and health department have repeatedly stressed that the COVID-19 vaccines are the most effective way of preventing hospitalizations and death caused by the virus and encouraged more New Yorkers to get their shots.Comments (0)Share to FacebookShare to TwitterEmail this articleTop StoriesFDA authorizes 4th COVID shot for everyone over 503 hours agoWhat to know about a 2nd COVID-19 booster for people over age 50Mar 29, 6:02 AMJada Pinkett Smith posts about 'healing' following Will Smith's apology to Chris Rock2 hours agoRep.

OffOnClosing arguments set in Cowboys for Trump founder 1/6 trialClosing arguments are expected in the trial of an elected official from New Mexico who's the second person tried on charges stemming from the U.S. Capitol riotBy MICHAEL KUNZELMAN Associated PressMarch 22, 2022, 10:38 AM• 6 min readShare to FacebookShare to TwitterEmail this article3:08On Location: March 29, 2022Catch up on the developing stories making headlines.The Associated PressWASHINGTON -- An elected official from New Mexico went to trial with a judge — not a jury — set to decide if he is guilty of charges that he illegally entered the U.S. Capitol grounds on the day         a pro-Trump mob disrupted the certification of Joe Biden's presidential election victory.U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden is scheduled to hear attorneys' closing arguments Tuesday for the case against Otero County Commissioner         Couy Griffin, whose trial in Washington, D.C., is the second among the hundreds of people charged with federal crimes related to         the Jan. 6, 2021, siege.The judge heard testimony Monday from three government witnesses. Griffin's lawyer said he doesn't plan to call any defense witnesses.The case against Griffin is unlike most of the Capitol riot prosecutions. He is one of the few riot defendants who isn't accused of entering the Capitol or engaging in any violent or destructive behavior. He claims he has been selectively prosecuted for his political views.Griffin, one of three members of the Otero County Commission in southern New Mexico, is among a handful of riot defendants who either held public office or ran for a government leadership post in the 2 1/2 years before the attack.He is among only three riot defendants who have asked for a bench trial, which means a judge will decide his case without a jury.Griffin, a 48-year-old former rodeo rider and former pastor, helped found         a political committee called Cowboys for Trump. He had vowed to arrive at the courthouse on horseback. Instead, he showed up Monday as a passenger in a pickup truck that had a horse trailer on the back.Griffin is charged with two misdemeanors: entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds and disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds.A key question in Griffin’s case is whether he entered a restricted area while Pence was still present on Capitol grounds, a prerequisite for the U.S. Secret Service to invoke access restrictions.Griffin’s attorneys said in a court filing that Pence had already departed the restricted area before the earliest that Griffin could have entered it, but Secret Service inspector Lanelle Hawa testified that Pence never left the restricted area during the riot.Hawa said agents took Pence from his office at the Capitol to a secure location at an underground loading dock on the Capitol complex. Pence remained in the loading dock location for four to five hours and never left the security perimeter before the joint session of Congress resumed on the night of Jan. 6, Hawa testified.Defense attorney Nicholas Smith asked Hawa if it was Pence's decision to remain there for hours.“I can't answer that,” she said.Smith said prosecutors apparently believe Griffin engaged in disorderly conduct by peacefully leading a prayer on the Capitol steps.“That is offensive and wrong,” Smith told the judge during his brief opening statements.Prosecutors didn’t give any opening statements. Their first witness was Matthew Struck, who joined Griffin at the Capitol and served as his videographer. Struck has an immunity deal with prosecutors for his testimony.After attending         then-President Donald Trump’s “Stop the Steal” rally on Jan. 6, Griffin and Struck walked over barriers and up a staircase to enter a stage that was under construction on the Capitol’s Lower West Terrace for         Biden’s inauguration, according to prosecutors.Prosecutors played video clips that showed Griffin moving through the mob that formed outside the Capitol, where police used pepper spray to quell rioters.“I love the smell of napalm in the air,” Griffin said in an apparent reference to a line by Robert Duvall's character in the war movie “Apocalypse Now.”After climbing over a stone wall and entering a restricted area outside the Capitol, Griffin said, “This is our house … we should all be armed,” according to prosecutors. He called it “a great day for America” and added, “The people are showing that they have had enough,” prosecutors said.Struck testified that he and Griffin went to the Capitol to find a place to pray. Smith asked Struck if anybody appeared to be “riled up” by the prayer that Griffin led.“They started chanting, ‘Pray for Trump,’” Struck replied. “It looks like they’ve been calm and they’re listening to Couy.”In a court filing, prosecutors called Griffin ""an inflammatory provocateur and fabulist who engages in racist invective and propounds baseless conspiracy theories, including that Communist China stole the 2020 Presidential Election.""Griffin's attorneys say hundreds if not thousands of other people did exactly what Griffin did on Jan. 6 and haven't been charged with any crimes.“The evidence will show that the government selected Griffin for prosecution based on the fact that he gave a speech and led a prayer at the Capitol, that is, selected him based on protected expression,” they wrote.More than 770 people have been charged with federal crimes related to the Capitol riot. More than 230 riot defendants have pleaded guilty, mostly to misdemeanors, and at least 127 of them have been sentenced. Approximately 100 others have trial dates.Earlier this month, a jury convicted a Texas man, Guy Wesley Reffitt, of storming the Capitol with a holstered handgun in         the first trial for a Capitol riot defendant. Jurors also convicted him of obstructing Congress from certifying the Electoral College vote on Jan. 6, of interfering with police officers who were guarding the Capitol and of threatening his two teenage children if they reported him to law enforcement.Reffitt's conviction on all charges could give prosecutors more leverage in negotiating plea deals in many other cases or discourage other defendants from going to trial. The outcome of Griffin's trial also could have a ripple effect, helping others to decide whether to let a judge or a jury decide their case.———Associated Press writer Jacques Billeaud in Phoenix contributed to this report.Comments (0)Share to FacebookShare to TwitterEmail this articleTop StoriesFDA authorizes 4th COVID shot for everyone over 503 hours agoWhat to know about a 2nd COVID-19 booster for people over age 50Mar 29, 6:02 AMJada Pinkett Smith posts about 'healing' following Will Smith's apology to Chris Rock2 hours agoRep.

Six high school-aged girls killed in a crash with semitruck had come to rolling stop, witnesses say, as first victim is identifiedBy Mallika Kallingal, CNNUpdated 7:16 PM ET, Fri March 25, 2022 The site of the crash near Tishomingo, south of Oklahoma City. (CNN)The car driven by six high school-aged girls who died in a crash with a semitruck on Tuesday came to a ""rolling stop"" at a stop sign before entering the highway, witnesses said, according to an ongoing National Transportation Safety Board investigation, as the first victim was identified on Friday.The girls were riding in a small passenger vehicle when it collided with a semitruck at an intersection in the city of Tishomingo, about 122 miles south of Oklahoma City.On Friday, one of the victims was identified as 15-year-old Brooklyn Triplett. Brooklyn's grandmother, Vada Triplett, confirmed her granddaughter's death to CNN.""Brooklyn was an amazing girl. She stood up for her beliefs and did not keep quiet when she felt someone was wronged."" Triplett told CNN. ""She was so funny, witty and smart. Words can't describe the wonderful light she had.""There is a stop sign regulating traffic at the intersection where the crash occurred and the posted speed limit for the highway is 50 mph. Witnesses said the Chevy entered US-377 after making a ""rolling stop"" at the stop sign and was hit by the semitruck on the front-left, which pushed it off the roadway, according to the update.Read MoreThe semitruck then veered off the road and came to stop in a private driveway off the highway. The driver of the truck was uninjured, the statement said.The investigation is continuing and the NTSB, in coordination with the Oklahoma Highway Patrol, has sent a team of four investigators and a family assistance specialist to Oklahoma to look into several issues.They will be evaluating highway conditions, like lighting and weather conditions, as well as accident histories at the site and potential reasons behind human error. They will also examine the vehicle's compliance with federal and state regulations.A memorial set up for the high school students who died TuesdayInvestigators will reconstruct the crash events and analyze physical evidence and vehicle damage, the statement said.The team's on-scene work is expected to conclude by Monday and a preliminary report is expected late next month. The full investigation -- which would include probable cause and any contributing factors -- will be completed in the next year or two.​​​""On behalf of our students, staff, families, and community I want to thank you for your thoughtfulness, prayers and encouragement,"" said Bobby Waitman, Tishomingo Public Schools superintendent, in a statement.""As we begin the process of broken hearts, I am reminded that our greatest priority as educators is to meet the emotional, mental, social and physical needs of our students. This is our focus at this time - and every day that we serve our students,"" Waitman's statement added.Rebekah Riess contributed to this report

         — 
    


      Debra Meadows, the wife of former congressman and Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows, signed voter forms attesting she resided at a Macon County, North Carolina, mobile home that reports indicate the couple never lived in. 
  

      On registration forms, both Debra and Mark Meadows indicated their residency at the Scaly Mountain mobile home would begin September 20, 2020 – one day after their voter registration forms were dated. 
  

      The North Carolina voter registration form instructs a person to provide their residential address – “where you physically live.” It is signed “under penalty of perjury.” A person is also required to check a box indicating whether they have lived at the address for 30 or more days. If not, a person must list the date they moved to that residence. Both Mark and Debra Meadows checked “no” and listed September 20, 2020. 
  

      The Washington Post first reported details about Debra Meadows’ voter forms.
  

      Last week, the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation confirmed to CNN that its Special Investigations Unit is investigating allegations that Mark Meadows registered to vote in 2020 at a home where he never resided. The investigation is being carried out in conjunction with the North Carolina State Board of Elections.

Mark Meadows' voter registration under investigation by state officials in North Carolina




      In response to a question Wednesday from CNN whether Debra Meadows is also under investigation, the State Bureau of Investigations said it is “early into this ongoing investigation” and as it moves forward “information will be shared with the prosecutor who will make a determination as to whether any additional persons could be subject to the investigation.”
  

      The Macon County district attorney’s office deferred comment to the state attorney general’s office. The North Carolina State Board of Elections referred all questions pertaining to the investigation to the SBI.
  

      A spokesman for Mark Meadows declined to comment. CNN has also reached out to Debra Meadows via her email with Right Women PAC, for which she is the executive director.
  

      The investigation followed a report in The New Yorker magazine that Meadows registered to vote weeks before the 2020 election at a mobile home in Macon County, where he allegedly never lived or even visited.
  

      The article quoted the unnamed former owner of the McConnell Road property in Scaly Mountain as saying that Meadows’ wife “reserved the house for two months at some point within the past few years – she couldn’t remember exactly when – but only spent one or two nights there” and that Meadows himself had never even “spent a night in there.”
  

      Debra Meadows voted early in person – known as one-stop voting in North Carolina – in Macon County in the 2020 general election. The box on her one-stop application certifying that she was a registered voter in the county and had “resided at the address noted above for 30 days immediately prior this election” was checked. The address listed is the Scaly Mountain mobile home. At the top of the form, it warns that “fraudulently or falsely completely this form is a Class 1 Felony.” Debra Meadows signed the one-stop application on October 26, 2020, the same day state records show she dropped off her husband’s absentee ballot. 
  

      An absentee ballot request form for Mark Meadows was submitted the first week of October 2020, with a request to send the ballot to an Alexandria, Virginia, address. The signature on that form is redacted; however, North Carolina State Board of Elections spokesperson Patrick Gannon told CNN that the signature says Mark Meadows. Gannon said it is not clear why Debra Meadows’ information is included in a section for requesting an absentee ballot for a relative. There is also a warning on the absentee ballot request form that “fraudulently or falsely completing this form is a Class 1 felony”.

Kemp signs income tax refund bill into law as Perdue blasts move as 'desperate attempt to get votes'By Eva McKend, CNNUpdated 6:05 PM ET, Thu March 24, 2022 Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signs a bill at the state Capitol in Atlanta on March 23, 2022, that will give income tax refunds of more than $1.1 billion to some Georgians. (CNN)Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp on Wednesday signed a bill that will make hundreds of dollars available to some Georgians in the coming weeks.Passed by the Republican-controlled legislature earlier this month, the legislation uses more than $1 billion of surplus government funds to provide income tax refunds for state residents who filed returns in 2020 and 2021.""When the government takes in more than it needs, I believe those dollars should be returned to the taxpayer,"" Kemp, a Republican, who is up for reelection this year, said in a statement.Like many states, Georgia has benefitted from strong tax revenues, which has helped it build up a surplus. It has collected nearly $20 billion in taxes from the start of the fiscal year in July to the end of February, an increase of 16% from the same period a year earlier. Revenue from individual and corporate income taxes, as well as sales taxes, have all grown by double digits so far this fiscal year. The tax refunds are not the only break that Peach State residents will receive. Kemp and lawmakers also recently suspended the state's 29.1-cent tax on gas and 32.6-cent tax on diesel, though the end of May.Read MoreKemp's move mirrors efforts in states across the country to provide relief to their residents in the face of inflation. In California, for example, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has proposed using billions in surplus state funds to dole out $400 debit cards and free public transit for 3 months to help Californians offset the high cost of gas.Trump-backed Perdue struggles in Republican primary challenge in GeorgiaFormer Sen. David Perdue, who is challenging Kemp in the Republican primary, blasted the Georgia governor's move as an ""election year giveaway and ""a desperate attempt to get votes."" The primary is set for May 24, and former President Donald Trump will campaign for Perdue on Saturday.At a campaign event attended by CNN earlier this month, Stacey Abrams, Kemp's opponent in the 2018 gubernatorial race and the likely Democratic nominee in this year's race, called Republicans out for bucking federal Covid relief efforts but still disseminating the funds.""We have had investments made in the state over the last few years. But let's be clear about where those dollars came from. As we see these massive amounts of money being passed out in this election year. I want us to remember it's not who put their name on the cards but who bought the gift. And while there might be a K name on the card, it's Biden and Warnock who got the money here,"" Abrams said at the time.CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to reflect the factors that contributed to Georgia's budget surplus.

Biden says he would be 'fortunate' if Trump ran against him againBy Maegan Vazquez and Sam Fossum, CNNUpdated 3:39 PM ET, Thu March 24, 2022 President Joe Biden speaks during a news conference at NATO after meeting with allies about the Russian invasion of Ukraine on Thursday, March 24, 2022, in Brussels.  (CNN)President Joe Biden on Thursday dismissed the challenge posed by a potential rematch with Donald Trump in 2024, saying he'd be ""very fortunate"" to face Trump again despite polling suggesting that such a contest would be very close.The remarks are especially notable coming during an emergency overseas trip with Western allies, many of whom fear a return to the America First — and largely anti-NATO — politics of Trump at a time of heightened anxiety about European security.Between meetings with world leaders in Brussels to coordinate the global response to Russia's war with Ukraine, Biden was asked in a news conference if he was concerned about whether American foreign policy would remain stable if someone else became president. Biden told reporters that he's not thinking about 2024. ""I don't criticize anybody for asking that question. But the next election -- I'd be very fortunate if I had that same man running against me,"" Biden told reporters, referring to Trump.Read MoreTrump has not formally announced a reelection bid but remains the single most popular figure in the Republican Party and has openly hinted that he will again seek the White House.Biden said on Thursday that the next election is far off and that he is focused on the upcoming midterms this November. ""So, we're a long way off in elections, a long way off. My focus of any election is on making sure that we retain the House and the United States Senate so that I have the room to continue to do the things that I've been able to do, in terms of grow the economy and deal in a rational way with American foreign policy and be the leader of the free world,"" Biden said. Trump's nationalist approach to foreign policy sought to break away from several longstanding US foreign policy traditions -- inciting trade wars with the European Union, pulling back the US' contribution to NATO's collective budget and accusing NATO allies of freeloading off American generosity. Since his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump asserted that some NATO member countries hadn't made requisite financial contributions for their common defense, suggesting the US would not have to fight for allied members if they had not fulfilled their obligations. Biden has sought to brand his presidency as one in which the US has returned to the diplomatic stage following an era of isolation under Trump. And he's repeatedly argued that America has a leading role to play in ensuring democracies persevere over autocracies. Biden and the White House have previously indicated that the President intends to run for reelection and that he plans to have Vice President Kamala Harris continue on as his running mate.  Biden told ABC News in December that he plans to run again, but suggested added that he's ""a great respecter of fate."" ""Fate has intervened in my life many, many times. If I'm in the health I'm in now -- I'm in good health -- then in fact I would run again,"" Biden continued.The President also said at the time that he would be up for a rematch against Trump, jokingly responding, ""You're trying to tempt me now.""""Sure. Why would I not run against Donald Trump? (If) he's the nominee, that increases the prospect of running,"" Biden added.A recent Wall Street Journal poll revealed that a majority of registered voters don't believe that Biden will run for a second term in 2024. Less than 1 in 3 respondents expect him to run again.Biden, who will be 81 on Election Day in 2024, is already the oldest person in American history to be inaugurated as president and the Dr. Kevin O'Connor, the White House physician, said after the President's annual physical last November that Biden is ""fit to successfully execute the duties of the president, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.""

The suspected ICBM flew to an altitude of 6,000 kilometers (3,728 miles) and to a distance of 1,080 kilometers (671 miles) with a flight time of 71 minutes before splashing down in waters off Japan's western coast on Thursday, according to Japan's Defense Ministry.Thursday's launch is North Korea's 11th of the year, including one on March 16 which is presumed to have failed. Analysts said the test could be the longest-range missile yet fired by North Korea, exceeding its last ICBM launch in November 2017. Japan's Vice Defense Minister Makoto Oniki told reporters Thursday the missile's altitude would suggest it is a ""new type of ICBM,"" a potential sign North Korea is closer to developing weapons capable of targeting the United States. North Korean state media later appeared to confirm Oniki's assessment, announcing the launch of a Hwasong-17 missile, the country's newest known ICBM variant. Read MoreThe US joined allies South Korea and Japan in strongly condemning the launch Thursday and called on North Korea to refrain from further destabilizing acts. US President Joe Biden is currently in Belgium, where he is attending a G7 summit alongside Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. The gathering is part of a series of meetings, including an extraordinary NATO summit, as Western leaders seek to align their responses to Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine. A European Council meeting will also take place Thursday.According to analysts, the recent spate of North Korean missile tests suggest the country's leader, Kim Jong Un, is attempting show an increasingly turbulent world that Pyongyang remains a player in the struggle for power and influence.""North Korea refuses to be ignored and may be trying to take advantage of global preoccupation with the war in Ukraine to force a fait accompli on its status as a nuclear weapons state,"" Leif-Eric Easley, associate professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, told CNN.""North Korea is nowhere near initiating aggression on the scale of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But Pyongyang's ambitions likewise exceed self-defense as it wants to overturn the postwar security order in Asia, added Easley. Thursday's test also comes just two weeks after South Korea elected a new conservative President, Yoon Suk Yeol, who is expected to take a harder line against North Korea than outgoing office holder President Moon Jae-in. In response to Thursday's suspected ICBM test, South Korea's military launched several warning missiles for the first time since 2017, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said in a text sent to reporters.""Our military is monitoring North Korean military's movements and have confirmed that we have the capability and posture to accurately strike the origin location of the missile launch and command and support facilities any time North Korea launches a missile,"" the JCS said.Provocative actAnalysts said North Korea appeared to have conducted a so-called lofted missile test Thursday. ""This is a tactic often employed by them to test longer range systems without more provocatively overflying another country,"" said Joseph Dempsey, research associate for defense and military analysis at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.He said the preliminary data of Thursday's test indicate it could be a Hwasong-17, a much larger ICBM than the Hwasong-15 tested in 2017.Kim Jong Un wants the world to know he still matters. Seven missile tests in a month may prove itKim Dong-yub, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, said data indicates Thursday's missile could have a maximum range of about 15,000 kilometers (9,320 miles) -- theoretically putting it within reach of the continental United States, depending on the weight of the warhead it would carry -- and about 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles) further than the Hwasong-15.Despite the potentially extended range, Kim said Pyongyang has still yet to demonstrate its ability to master the technology required to enable a warhead to successfully re-enter the Earth's atmosphere into the final stages of flight.US response Pyongyang's other most recent launches, on February 26 and March 4, were likely intended to test a new ICBM system, the US Defense Department said earlier this month.The US Indo-Pacific Command announced earlier this month that the US is intensifying ""intelligence, readiness and surveillance collection activities"" related to North Korea following the recent missile launches.The move is a signal from the Biden administration that it needs to strengthen its military posture to ensure the US and allies in the region like South Korea and Japan are protected against North Korea's missile tests.The command said they have ""ordered intensified Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance collection activities in the Yellow Sea, as well as enhanced readiness among our ballistic missile defense forces in the region.""Earlier this month, the US military staged exercises on and around the Korean Peninsula to show its readiness in the wake of North Korean activity, including simulating ballistic missile defense systems.The US Army's 35th Air Defense Artillery Brigade moved to a remote location, ""occupying its wartime defensive position, emplacing the Patriot missile system, and executing air and missile defense operations under a simulated combat scenario,"" US Forces Korea said in a press release.And at sea, F-35 and F/A-18 fighter jets flying off the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln along with US Air Force assets based in the region put on a show of force in the Yellow Sea off the western coast of South Korea, according to a statement from the US Navy's 7th Fleet in Japan.This story has been updated to clarify the location of missile.

Manhattan prosecutor who quit team investigating Trump insists ex-President is guilty

         — 
    


      A former Manhattan prosecutor who investigated Donald Trump and his business empire said in his resignation letter obtained by CNN that the former President was “guilty of numerous felony violations” in connection to his annual financial statements.
  

      “His financial statements were false, and he has a long history of fabricating information relating to his personal finances and lying about his assets to banks, the national media, counterparties, and many others, including the American people,” Mark Pomerantz wrote in the letter. “The team that has been investigating Mr. Trump harbors no doubt about whether he committed crimes — he did.”
  

      Pomerantz and Carey Dunne, two senior prosecutors on the team, resigned last month – one day after Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg informed them that he wasn’t prepared to move forward with criminal charges. The resignations followed weeks of internal debate and discussion over the strength of the evidence against Trump and whether it could pass the hurdle of proving a crime.
  

      Trump has not been charged with a crime.
  

      According to Pomerantz, the previous district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr., had “concluded that the facts warranted prosecution, and he directed the team to present evidence to a grand jury and to seek an indictment of Mr. Trump.”

      Bragg took over in January. His office insists that the investigation is ongoing and has announced that another attorney has been appointed to lead the team.
  

      “The investigation continues,” said Danielle Filson, spokeswoman for the district attorney. “A team of experienced prosecutors is working every day to follow the facts and the law. There is nothing more we can or should say at this juncture about an ongoing investigation.”
  

      According to Pomerantz, the investigation has been suspended pending further developments. “I believe that your decision not to prosecute Donald Trump now, and on the existing record, is misguided and completely contrary to the public interest,” he wrote to Bragg. “I therefore cannot continue in my current position.”
  

      Pomerantz also warned that a failure to prosecute will undermine public confidence in the justice system and “the bedrock proposition that ‘no man is above the law.’ ” He added that the “ability to establish what happened may erode with the further passage of time.” 
  

      Pomerantz declined to comment about the letter to CNN.
  

      Ronald Fischetti, an attorney for Trump, disputed Pomerantz’s characterization of the case.
  

      “There just was not sufficient evidence to charge my client,” Fischetti told CNN. “Believe me, I’ve worked on this case for longer than Mark was there. I know the evidence that he has, he doesn’t have one live witness who would take the stand and point a finger at Donald Trump and say that he was corrupt. Not one.”
  

      “In my opinion, I think Alvin Bragg should get credit for what he did. He decided this case based on the lack of evidence, not based on politics,” Fischetti said.

Shares in the Chinese social media and gaming giant tumbled around 6% in Hong Kong on Thursday after its US-listed shares closed 5.4% lower on Wall Street.The stock plunge came after Tencent (TCEHY) reported revenue of 144.2 billion yuan ($22.6 billion) for the fourth quarter of 2021, up 8% from a year earlier. That's the slowest revenue growth since the company listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2004.Tencent's annual revenue for 2021 was up 16% compared to the previous year, slowing from the 28% growth it recorded in 2020.Co-founder Pony Ma and president Martin Lau joined an earnings call on late Wednesday and acknowledged that 2021 was a ""challenging year"" for Tencent and China's internet industry more broadly. Since November 2020, Chinese authorities have launched a sweeping crackdown in an effort to rein in big players in industries ranging from tech and finance to gaming, entertainment and private education.China's 'unprecedented' crackdown stunned private enterprise. One year on, it may have to cut business some slackRead MoreThe internet industry has faced ""fundamental changes and challenges,"" Lau said during the call, adding that ""new regulations have been introduced"" to correct industry misbehavior and promote fair competition, user protection and data security.These ""structural industry challenges"" have affected Tencent's financial performance, leading to slower revenue growth as the company adjusted to the new environment, Lau said.Both Ma and Lau endorsed Beijing's crackdown on the tech industry, reiterating regulators' words that the government restrictions will help end the industry's ""reckless expansion"" and ""frothy growth.""""We are proactively embracing changes to better align ourselves with a new industry paradigm,"" Lau said, adding that the company will focus more on user value, tech innovation, and social responsibility.

         — 
    


      Mackenzie Scott said Wednesday she has donated more than $3.8 billion to 465 organizations since June.
  

      In a Medium post, Scott said her team’s focus in the past nine months continued to be helping underrepresented people from various backgrounds and communities. The billionaire philanthropist gave money to Planned Parenthood locations across the United States as well as to organizations helping at-risk children, minorities, refugees and rural health access, according to the post.
  

      Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, recently gave $436 million to Habitat for Humanity — her largest known donation to date — and $133.5 million to educational nonprofit Communities in School, according to previous statements from the organizations. 
  

      “When our giving team focuses on any system in which people are struggling, we don’t assume that we, or any other single group, can know how to fix it. We don’t advocate for particular policies or reforms,” Scott wrote. “Instead, we seek a portfolio of organizations that supports the ability of all people to participate in solutions. This means a focus on the needs of those whose voices have been underrepresented.”
  

      With an estimated net worth of $55 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Scott is well known for her philanthropic behaviors and surprise donations to organizations. Scott signed the Giving Pledge in 2019, a non-binding agreement launched in 2010 by Warren Buffett and Bill and Melinda Gates for billionaires to promise to give away their wealth to those in need. 
  

      Scott has thus far given away over $12 billion of her personal wealth in four rounds, according to Forbes.

Starting Wednesday, Arizona residents with TSA PreCheck can present their digital driver's license or state ID by tapping their iPhone or Apple Watch at select Transportation Security Administration checkpoints in Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. However, they'll still need their physical IDs to fly home if traveling to a state that's not in the Apple program — in other words, any other state in the country.The dark side of Discord for teensiPhone users will also still need to show their physical ID to, for example, enter a bar, get documents notarized or show law enforcement at traffic stops, both in other states and in Arizona. Apple said it is exploring more ways for people to use digital verification in the future.Last year, Apple (AAPL) teased it was working with several states on the initiative, including Georgia, Connecticut, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma and Utah. Apple originally noted on its website that the feature would launch last year, but the company told CNN Business it was a complicated process to implement and it's been working closely with the states to make this available as soon as possible.On Wednesday, Apple announced plans to also introduce the feature to Colorado, Hawaii, Mississippi, Ohio and Puerto Rico. Read MoreThe rollout is part of Apple's ongoing effort to boost support for its digital wallet. Apple already offers features such as digital credit cards, movie tickets, car keys, boarding passes and gift cards. These features offer the promise of an added layer of convenience, push iOS users deeper into its ecosystem of services, and make the iPhone even more central to our lives. To ensure the ID is official, the user will have to take a selfie after scanning and uploading a picture of their driver's license or state ID card. The user will also be required to complete facial and head movements, similar to how Face ID is activated. The upload will be ""securely provided"" to the state for verification, according to Apple.Once activated and approved, users can tap their iPhone or Apple Watch on the identity reader at the security checkpoint and the agent will see the information required to fly. It works similarly to how people use the Wallet to make purchases at card readers. Apple previously said information on the IDs is ""encrypted and protected against tampering and theft."" Biometric authentication is also used to ensure the proper person is using the phone or watch.On their iPhone or Apple Watch, users will be shown which specific information is requested by the TSA.

John Kerry plans to stay in climate envoy role through late 2022, says climate action in Congress is 'imperative' By Ella Nilsen, CNNUpdated 4:18 PM ET, Thu March 24, 2022 John Kerry speaks during an interview on the David Rubenstein Show in Washington in January. The former Secretary of State confirmed to CNN that he plans to remain in his international climate envoy role through at least November. (CNN)John Kerry, President Joe Biden's Special Envoy for Climate, told CNN he plans to stay in his current role through at least the next major international climate summit in November.""There's no plan to do otherwise at this point in time, certainly,"" Kerry told CNN Thursday. ""I haven't even thought about anything else right now."" Kerry said he plans to attend the 2022 UN climate summit -- COP27 -- in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, to press other countries to raise their climate ambitions, slash methane and carbon emissions, and transition to renewable energy faster.People close to Kerry told CNN in November that it was widely assumed he would step down after COP26 in Glasgow.Countries promised at that summit to come to COP27 with plans in-hand on how to slash their fossil fuel use. And while the final deal from COP26, the Glasgow Climate Pact, made an unprecedented mention of the role of fossil fuels in the climate crisis, it failed to secure a commitment to phase out the use of coal -- which has a significant impact on global warming and creates harmful air pollution.Read More""We hope to go to Sharm el-Sheikh with a clear roadmap of what has been accomplished with respect to those promises made, and what has been done to raise the level of ambition and commitment from those who haven't yet done that,"" Kerry said. ""That's our current target, with this effort here. We're currently gearing up to try to make sure that we can get done all the things I just described."" Action from Congress 'is absolutely imperative'Kerry spoke to CNN from Paris, where he was attending the International Energy Agency's annual ministerial meeting. Domestic policy crept into the Climate Envoy's conversations Wednesday night, when Kerry told CNN he had dinner with West Virgina Sen. Joe Manchin, Democrats' key swing vote on climate legislation, who was also attending the IEA meeting.  There's new momentum in Congress for a climate bill, but a lot of questions on what it could include""We talked and shared a table last night at dinner and we had a nice conversation about it all,"" Kerry told CNN, not going into details about what was discussed.  Climate action in Congress is riding on Manchin's shoulders, after he torpedoed Biden's Build Back Better legislation, which included more than $500 billion in clean energy measures.  Manchin has said he's supportive of clean energy tax credits. But amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Manchin -- the chair of the Senate Energy Committee -- has also called for more fossil fuel production in the US to help Europe move away from Russia's natural gas.  ""I think he is definitively concerned about doing some of the things he thinks ought to be done,"" Kerry said. Whether that takes shape in a bill ""is up to him and the folks he's negotiating directly with"" in the White House. Speaking at the IEA on Wednesday, Manchin described what he considers an ideal US energy transition, including promoting carbon capture and sequestration for fossil fuels, passing clean energy manufacturing tax credits and providing more funding for advanced nuclear reactors. Climate groups sue Interior Department over controversial Black Friday report on oil and gas leasingBut Manchin also expressed skepticism about the shift to electric vehicles, a key plank of Biden and Democrats' climate plans.  ""I'm a little bit skeptical of the electric vehicles that everyone's moving to as rapidly as they are,"" Manchin said. ""I'm very much concerned about the supply chain. I am very much concerned about being totally relying on China to supply the necessary resources we need to have that transition happen."" But Kerry said he is still optimistic a climate action bill will pass through Congress.   ""It's not going to be Build Back Better; it's going to be something different,"" Kerry said. ""My hope is we're going to pass it. I feel like there's greater potential that we will do that than some people may believe. I trust that there's some real possibility of getting climate legislation passed as part of something."" He added that the US taking legislative action on the climate crisis is ""absolutely imperative."" ""I don't want to speculate what happens if we don't,"" Kerry told CNN. ""I'm going to count on doing it, because we've got to do it."" Helping Europe wean off Russian natural gasBiden on Friday is expected to make a major announcement on increasing US liquid natural gas shipments exports to help Europe transition away from Russian fuel -- which some climate advocacy groups oppose, fearing it would require new infrastructure that would produce fossil fuel for years to come.  Kerry said the natural gas announcement will mark ""a beginning, it's not the end of the process.""  'Delay means death': We're running out of ways to adapt to the climate crisis, new report shows. Here are the key takeawaysOther countries are planning to increase their natural gas exports to Europe as well; Kerry met with Israel's IEA delegation and said that country stepping up their gas production could account for about 10% of what Russia currently supplies to Europe.  But the US climate envoy said non-fossil fuel options -- like electric heat pumps -- have also been part of the conversation. Heat pumps are energy-efficient heating systems that can replace natural gas furnaces. ""There's a lot of discussion going on right now about heat pumps specifically and about other things that we can do to assist Europe to minimize the impact of the loss of Russian gas and oil,"" Kerry said. ""Not all these plans have been carved in stone at this point. I think heat pumps are a very real alternative to the burning of fuel that takes place today."" An 'excruciating year': Climate activists reset with Biden's agenda on life support  Kerry said he thinks it makes the most sense for Europe to manufacture their own heat pumps, and for the US to jump in and manufacture more if the demand grows.  ""Europe makes terrific heat pumps,"" Kerry said. ""I would imagine the Europeans are hot to trot in their own market here; I don't think they're sitting around waiting for the US to necessarily do it. But where it might be necessary -- yes, it makes sense for other markets to contribute the products where the demand exists."" Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico recently told CNN he's been having discussions with top economic officials in the White House about increasing the US production of heat pumps to send to Europe.  Heinrich said he met with National Economic Council Director Brian Deese and White House American Rescue Plan coordinator Gene Sperling last week and pushed the idea of ramping up heat pump production.  ""There's certainly a lot of interest,"" Heinrich told CNN of the meeting, adding Sperling and Deese ""are both very aware of what we're pushing, and seem receptive.""This story has been updated with additional information.
